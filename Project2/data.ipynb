      "2->***READ HERE FIRST!  TERRIBLE REPLACEMENT!*** | 1 | 266 | If you've been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S.  You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows \"8000 series\" as it has been discontinued for over a year.  Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series (Activator) with the 360 Complete.  This new foil/cutterblock is garbage!  The cutterblock has wide blades, as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series, which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave.  They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3(THREE) of these in 6 months!  (I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining).  All the free replacements in the world weren't making the shaving experience any better.  I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth, close, and comfortably.  After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far!  I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review.  It worked PERFECTLY!  The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades!  It didn't pull my stubble, it cut smooth as butter, and was comfortable: JUST LIKE NEW!  I'd like to thank the original reviewer (James L. Walls \"sixtoe\") for the very good advice.<br /><br />***Update: August 10th, 2011***<br />I hope people are happy with the replacement I recommended.  I sure am!  I just wanted to update the product link for the better replacement: [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]<br /><br />***Update: January 13, 2013***<br />Unfortunately, the Braun 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack is now the same terrible cutter block design as the series 5 (8000 replacement).  I ordered another 30B to replace the one I bought 2.5 years ago and was highly disappointed when the package came.  I will have to do some research to see if any of Braun's other replacements are the good, narrow blade versions.  I have read some reports that the narrow cutting block is available, but without the foil.  If I cannot find a narrow blade replacement I am going to throw in the towel after 8 years of service from this shaver.  Shame on Braun for putting out those ill performing wide blade cutting blocks.  Terrible...<br /><br />***Update: January 18, 2013***<br /><br />It appears the highly elusive narrow blade cutter block can be found on the 31S replacement pack.  The unfortunate news is the included foil is not compatible.  Therefore, a replacement foil for the 8000 series/Activator/7000 series/360 Complete would be needed in conjunction with the quality cutter block effectively doubling your cost because it is difficult to find the foil sold by itself.  This would be a combined expense of roughly $55-$60 in order to bring your shaver back to the \"like new\" shave we all want.  Remember - the \"direct\" replacement combo for this shaver series will leave you highly disappointed due to the WIDE cutter block which pulls hair and easily nicks skin.  Another facet to influence your decision in spending $60 to refresh your Braun is many of these shavers - due to their age - are in need of new motors and potentially batteries.  The motors gradually slow down with time and I noticed a HUGE difference when I replaced mine 2 years ago.  Now, these motors are almost impossible to find at this point and for me, personally, it is getting to the point of diminished returns.  I hope this post helps you in both informing you of the available narrow cutter block, but also in weighing your decision in either keeping your Braun chugging along or researching a new alternative.\n",
      "3->Does not fit a hair dryer with 2.25\" nozzle | 2 | 197 | This seems like a great product, and I would have kept it if it had fit on my hair dryer.<br />My hair dryer nozzle is 2.25&#34; wide, which is what the item description stated it would be compatible with. No such luck. Width of diffuser at point it would attach to the dryer is only 2&#34;, and the silicone does not stretch enough to attach to my dryer.<br />Unfortunately, this item is being returned :(\n",
      "4->Pros and Cons to Consider | 3 | 148 | I have very dense, thick, and long 4C hair, so my texture is the most coarse texture of hair to possibly test the durability of this blower-dryer comb.  Anyone that has coarse or thick hair such as yours truly, likely runs into the same problem as me when you blow dry your hair after a washing. The dang blow-dryer comb keeps popping off and/or the teeth bends and snaps off. So annoying!  Since this is very expensive for a blow-dryer comb, I'm sure ladies will appreciate this critical review before purchasing.  Here are the pros and cons I've come across.<br /><br />Pros...The material is the highest grade of plastic (not at all rubber) I have seen in a blow-dryer comb.  It appears to be equivalent to the &#34;plastic&#34; material cooking utensils are made of, so the teeth does not easily bend/break.  The finer and less dense your hair is, the longer the life-time you will have this comb.  If you attach it securely, the comb actually works without popping off.<br /><br />Cons...This seems to only work for dryers with a narrow barrel, and not so much for the dryers that has a bubble shape.  It will pop off dryers with a bubble shaped barrel, because it will be impossible to secure it on a nozzle tip that is not cylinder-shaped.  All you need is a phillips screwdriver to attach it. Since I have 4C hair, I did actually notice slight bending of a couple teeth, and the bending increased after a 3rd usage.  After my 3rd hair drying, I tried to hand-bend the teeth back in place, and 2 snapped off!  $40 bucks (cost and shipping) down the drain :-(  Also, what you don't know until you see it in person is that there is a metal bar inside the comb, that is being raked against your hair as you are combing it, which will eventually cause heat damage with prolonged usage, especially if you dry your hair on high.<br /><br />My overall assessment is that, yes it worked better that expected.  Although 2 teeth broke on mine and others slightly bent, I plan on buying another one to have on-hand, as I currently have not come across any better options.  But, I'm going to take a break from this comb for a while, and try drying my hair with a paddle brush and my dryer because the thought of that metal bar inside the Willie Morrow comb, raking against my hair with every usage is alarming, and will surely heat damage my hair.\n",
      "5->The Best & Cheap Electric Shaver You Can Buy! However You Get What You Pay For Though! | 3 | 147 | UPDATE: 08-01-21<br /><br />Its been nearly another year that I've owned these shavers, which makes a total of 3-years of ownership. Has my opinion on these shavers changed? Well, one just has to take a look at my updated rating and you have your answer. About a month after my first replacement, (which you can read about in the 2020 update) I discovered that the battery wasn't holding a charge as good as my first shaver, it got so bad that the charger would die, unless I had it plugged in all the time. This did not give me confidence at all!<br /><br />Also, the cutting head from the get go, felt like it wasn't as sharp as the first shavers cutting head. I mean, we all know the blade isn't made out of Japanese steel but this is ridiculous, a new shaver head should be sharp! Because I did not want to write this product off too soon, I continued using the shaver for almost a complete year, and now the shaver head feels as dull as the last shaver after 2-years of use. For an entire year, this shaver was providing me a nice shade of red rash on my neck, nothing like walking into a store looking like you just came back from getting tortured by someone.<br /><br />I simply could not put up with it anymore, and I am sorry to have to admit this, but I went back to a name brand shaver. I did my research, and I discovered that Panasonic was still making quality shavers made in Japan. I decided to also switch from a rotary design shaver, to a foil design shaver, as they provide a closer shave. The Panasonic Arc4 ES 8243AA is a much nicer shaver hands down! If you want to take 30-minutes for a red rash shave, then stick with Aefee, if you want a 10-minute shave that leaves you looking good afterwords, get the Panasonic.<br /><br />Review has been updated to 3 out of 5 stars as of August 1st 2021...<br /><br />UPDATE: 09-05-20<br /><br />My wonderful shaver has recently been pulling my hairs, and taking twice as long to shave, which is due to the shaving head being dull. I went searching for replacement heads for my shaver, saw that there used to be some that were sold on Amazon, but they are out of stock, with no confidence that they will be back in stock, anytime soon. I saw that this shaver was still being sold to this day, and for cheaper then before! I thought, for 17-dollars, that would be about the same cost for a replacement head, for a cheap shaver, might as well buy a new one, even if my old one still works. I then decided it was time to go and update my review to reflect the longevity I got out of my old shaver.<br /><br />Only to discover that it wasn't 1-year that I've owned my shaver like I thought, but 2-years! My oh my how time flies. That means, that I have been shaving on the original cutting head for 2-years, thats unheard of for electric shavers, holy cow! So there is my longevity review guys, 2-years, still kicking, just needs a new head, but no replacement head in stock. 17-dollars is all I had to pay to buy a new shaver, its a no brainer. So, guys, if your looking for a shaver that is going to get the job done, this is what you need. Now, if the company can get replacement heads back in stock that would be great. But for now, you can just buy a new shaver when your head goes dull.<br /><br />I am keeping my review at 5-STARS!  :)<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I have used several electric shavers in my life, all of them being Norelco. I was never a fan of the two-bladed shavers, I grow a thick beard, and it just takes too long to shave with those things. The 3-bladed shavers can be hit or miss depending on brand/model. Norelco used to make quality shavers back in the 80's and 90's. Since Phillips's acquisition of the Norelco brand however, the quality has gone down drastically. Many reviews complain of underpowered motors, motors burning out early, and poor shaving quality, unless of course you buy the high end 200 dollar model, then your in heaven lol.<br /><br />Thankfully these day, we have a choice. I don't know about you, but I am not in the rich income bracket, I can't just dump 200 dollars into a shaver just to get something that is quality.  Fortunately, there are many different types of shavers made in China now, that are much more affordable. What sold me on this shaver, is that it uses a 800MAH lithium rechargeable battery, that can be charged via USB. It uses a pretty blue LED battery indicator display, which shows minutes of run-time remaining.<br /><br />It uses a standard 3-bladed system, with a pop up side-burn trimmer. It is also easy to pop the blades off and clean them, and even though I didn't require this feature, it is also IPX7 waterproof. The shaver comes with a nice velvet pouch, a brush, USB cable, and a operators manual. When I turned the unit on, I couldn't believe how quiet this thing runs, most certainly quieter then the old 80's - 90's Norelco models. So the question you might be asking is, how does it perform?<br /><br />If all you have is stubble, you can expect this to provide a pretty smooth shave within a reasonable amount of time. I just did nice and slow rotational movements, as you are supposed to do with this type of shaver, and it did a pretty good job! If you let your beard get beyond a stubble, as one would expect, it does take longer to get the job done, but the shaver was able to do it, and seemed to have enough power, not just in time duration, but also in horse power.<br /><br />Since I did not do a wet shave with this, I can't speak as to its effectiveness. I bought an electric shaver for the convenience of a dry shave, as wet shaving is a pain in the but for me. While the water proof rating allows one to simply run the head under the water stream to clean it out, I however just used the brush that they supplied, and some canned air, and it did just as good, without fully taking the blades out of the head. Recharge time is faster then they state when utilizing a powerful Anker wall charger that puts out 3 amps. I charged my battery from 45 minutes left, to 60-minutes left, in only 20 minutes.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe this to be a very nice electric shaver. And for the price I paid for it, I expected it to be weaker in construction, however, that is further from the truth. The construction of this shaver is top notch, and rivals higher end Phillips Norelco's in my humble opinion. If you need a quality electric shaver that will get the job done, and doesn't break the bank, I highly recommend this one! 5 out of 5 stars!\n",
      "6->Full disclosure: I have trichotillomania and do generally get a little bit of physical enjoyment from pain, so... | 4 | 145 | When I initially read reviews for this, I was excited to see people complaining about it being tedious and painful. That's honestly what I was kind of hoping for. Guys. Let's be real. Getting this done professionally is also tedious and painful, but you're on someone else's schedule. I'm so here for the convenience of just being able to sit down and do this tedious, painful task on my own time, while watching season after season of Always Sunny in Philadelphia. A few things I learned:<br /><br />1) using salt water rather than just regular water is crucial.<br />2) you can't do this to someone else, it don't work. It means PERSONAL when it says personal. I'm going to guess it has something to do with science/electrical current, but I don't actually know, I just found that I couldn't help my sister out with the little black hairs on her neck, but when she held the wand herself, it worked fine.<br />3) yes, that's lye.<br />4) yes, those are burns.<br />5) aquaphor.<br /><br />It's performing the job it's meant to do, which is a painful, tedious job, but it absolutely does what it says it will do. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars for fulfilling it's intended purpose as described is because of that annoying beeping. I don't understand the purpose of that. It's irritating. Why not use a pleasant LED light fade on the box instead?? Something that doesn't scream at me? Maybe?<br /><br />There had to have been other design options.\n",
      "8->This is being done by lots of women so it must be working for them. | 1 | 133 | I had a hard time believing the only other review of this product.  She made it sound so easy and non-hurtful.  My opinion may be jaded because I am old Senior Citizen and have had all the little hurts to fill a lifetime diary.  Maybe hurt is the wrong word.....maybe the right word is JUST different than I anticipated.  I also do not feel  educated in things like this well enough to do something to my face.<br /><br />However, I asked all the other retirees in the dining room today and some said their daughters/granddaughters had used something like this and thought it worked wonders.  Unfortunately, I can't use their statements....only my own.<br />And for me. I just didn't like it enough to continue doing it again.\n",
      "11->Wake up to the sound of a clean, close shave. | 5 | 117 | I was shopping for replacement cutters and combs for a Norelco Micro Action (formerly Lift & Cut [formerly Rotatract]) shaver and noticed that for less than $10 more I could have a whole new  Norelco shaver. I was sold.<br /><br />Norelco Reflex Plus shavers combine 4 features pioneered by Norelco and improved over time. Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers. Floating heads individually hug the skin. Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave. Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.<br /><br />I've been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn't a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I'd expect from a Norelco.<br /><br />The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black & Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn't nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!<br /><br />A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words \"MADE IN HOLLAND\" on the bottom of every Norelco I've owned.<br /><br />Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.\n",
      "12->There are pros and cons... | 3 | 111 | Over all it's a good mask...howvevr there are pros and cons I'll list here.<br /><br />Pros<br />Light weight on the eyes and face, the beads aren't packed in super tight so it's a comfortable fit.<br /><br />Covers a larger area of the eyes/face than most masks<br /><br />The material holds up to hand cleaning very well.<br /><br />Cons<br />Because the beads aren't packed in tight, it doesn't retain heat as well. I have to heat this up 3 times to do my full routine VS my bruder I only heat it twice.<br /><br />Each side reads a different temperature. I use a laser thermometer to make sure my compress is around 44-45C before I apply it to my face and the mask heats unevenly.\n",
      "14->Very nice neutral tone pinks. | 4 | 95 | Love that these pinks are similar to nude or neutral colors. I bought this set because I really liked the way the Mia shade looks.<br /><br />My only dislike with this is the same dislike I have with other Zoya lighter shade polishes; that is that I have to apply 3 coats in order to rid of streaks and to prevent lumpiness. However, I’m still impressed because even with 3 coats, Zoya’s polish is still light as a feather!\n",
      "15->A Bit Difficult to Use but Produces Very Pretty Curls! | 4 | 92 | For many years I've always straightened my hair because I cannot seem to get the hang of using curling irons to make pretty spiral curls. Wearing the same hairstyle all the time with long hair can get a bit boring so I decided to search on Amazon for styling tools that are easy to use. I initially ordered the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] and really loved the results so much that I also purchased this Rock 'n' Roller styling iron, which I affectionately call my &#34;bubble curler.&#34;<br /><br />The Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron comes with the iron itself along with a black protective glove to protect your hand from the heat of this iron since there is no clamp. The iron measures almost 15 inches in length, with the heating barrel measuring about 5 3/4 inches. The balls measure about one inch in diameter. The cord measures almost six feet so there is plenty of length to move around with it. The iron has a black ball at the top so you can hold it while using it, a safety stand that works well, an on/off switch, a temperature dial that allows you to choose among the low, medium, and high settings as well as the temperatures in between all of them, and a swivel cord so you can easily move the iron around as you use it. I found that it heats up quickly and cools off rapidly as well in case you need to pack it up in your suitcase soon after using it. The glove fits well but I didn't end up using it since it feels a bit awkward to use while trying to grip strands of hair so I took a chance and kept my hand bare, with no problems as long as I styled my hair in front of a mirror so I could watch closely what I was doing.<br /><br />I found this styling iron a bit difficult to use at first but it gets easier with practice. I just winged it and have included some pictures of my end result. There is a chart in the instructions as to what heat setting is most likely appropriate for your hair type but they recommend you start with the lowest setting and increase the heat as needed. I have wavy to medium hair so I started off using the low setting but ended up using the medium setting. I have long hair and it was fairly simple to wrap my hair around the barrel. When I got toward the end of the strands of hair, I carefully wrap them around the barrel, holding my fingers as close as I can to the styling iron without actually touching it. Then I roll the styling iron towards my head as close as I can so my hair gets curled as much as possible. I hold my hair in that position for about 40 seconds and then release it and curl my whole head. It probably took about a half hour to style all of my hair and then I finished by spraying it with hairspray. I didn't add any product to my hair before I started although you probably could if your hair works better that way.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this styling iron and really like the end result. Hopefully it will get easier to use with time. I found it a bit difficult to use because, without having a clamp on the iron, I had to hold both arms up in the air and my muscles got tired pretty quickly. I'm in fairly good shape but perhaps this will get easier with time. I actually prefer the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] because I feel it's easier to use and I love the beach waves I get from it so I will most likely use that one more but this one is still good to have. If you want spiral curls, I'd purchase the Rock 'n' Roller Styling Iron but if you prefer beach waves, I'd purchase the Deep Waver. The price is just what I wanted to spend and I like the fact that I can have more hairstyles than just straightened hair! I recommend purchasing this styling iron if you want to add some variety to your hairstyle and aren't comfortable using a regular curling iron to get spiral curls.\n",
      "17->Corporate Greed Ruins Good Shaver... | 2 | 89 | The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life. Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself.<br /><br />The way it does this is that it turns on the \"change blade\" warning LED. And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day. Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades.<br /><br />Way to go Norelco. I used to be a big fan.\n",
      "20->Seems to work okay, but not a lot of care's been put into it | 3 | 85 | I've been using this brush for about 6 weeks, and haven't had a dental checkup in the meantime, so it's a bit hard to know how well it's really been working.<br /><br />But here are a few observations:<br /><br />- It feels cheap.  Maybe it's just that I'm used to the solid heft of my trusty Sonicare toothbrush, but this Oral-B toothbrush feels like something you'd get at Safeway for $49.95, not $99.95.<br /><br />- The polishing brush does seem to do a pretty thorough job.  The main brush (whatever it's called) also seems rather decent.<br /><br />- The tongue cleaner is worse than useless.  A cheapie Walgreens manual tongue scraper does a much better job.<br /><br />- So, too, does the interdental-stimulator / toothpick thingy seem pretty useless.  Manual flossing is just as fast and seems much more thorough.  And dental floss is about half a penny per 'serving', whereas the replacement Oral-B things are much more expensive.<br /><br />- The base is so top-heavy, I've accidentally knocked it over twice, hurling the toothbrush to the floor (ouch!).  Thankfully, the toothbrush still seems to work fine, but as you can guess, I finally wised up and screwed the base to the wall.  I never had such a problem with the Sonicare.<br /><br />- No carrying case?  Not even any friggin' cap for the toothbrush?  This basically makes it a total pain to cleanly transport this brush to work or on a trip or anywhere else.  ALL the Sonicares (and their replacement brushheads) come with a simple, effective plastic cover.  What was Oral-B thinking?!<br /><br />In fairness, this toothbrush probably merits a 3.5, and if I get a great bill-of-health from my dentist at my next checkup, I'll revise this review to a 4.  But in the meantime, I'm certainly disappointed that Oral-B has given a bargain-bin treatment to a premium-priced product.\n",
      "22->You can stop looking--THIS is \"The One\"!!!! | 5 | 71 | This Eyelash Curler is the BOMB!  I'm over 40 and have long eyelashes enhanced by several years of using Latisse.  The only issue is, while my lashes ARE long, they are \"Unruly\".  They stick out in multiple directions and if I don't use a curler, they look horrible.  Over three years ago I purchased a Shu Uemura online from their site.  I was happy with it and it performed well, but the pads wore out and when I went online to purchase another one, I was disappointed to see that not only were they purchased by L'Oreal, they were completely out of stock on eyelash curlers on their own website!  The internet is FLOODED with counterfeit Shu Uemuras and frankly I didn't want that either.  So I went in search of an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased another high rated curler, the Billy B Eyelash curler online hoping that it would do the trick.  The Billy B one is \"different\" from the Uemura--it has a more rounded shape and I was hoping it would do a fabulous job.  Unfortunately I found that I had a harder time getting the rounded Billy B up next to my eyelash base, and inevitably it would miss my corner lashes entirely.  I'm sure the Billy B works well for people with smaller, more rounded eyes, and in all honesty the pads on it were great.  It just wasn't the right fit for me.<br /><br />So again I went searching and that's when I stumbled across the Bella & Bear.  This thing is awesome and with a single coat of mascara for work, my eyelashes look a mile long and very well separated.  I can't say enough good things about how easy this was to put up against my eyeline and get a good curl.  The handle fits my hand well and the spring loaded mechanism on this means you don't have to press all that hard to achieve a good curl.  It's flatter and not as rounded as the Billy B, so if your eyes are longer and flatter, this one should be able to easy grab from corner to corner without missing any lashes.  In fact, when I lined up my curlers side by side, you can see the shape of this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.<br /><br />The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won't have to worry about it being broken in shipment.<br /><br />In all, I'm so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I've already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter's long eyelashes during dance recitals.  My search for the perfect curler is over!\n",
      "27->Oh my lord, are those my pores? | 4 | 60 | It's lovely, looks nice on the counter. However, I warn y'all, if you ever want to feel bad about your skin, look at it at 10x.  I'm not completely sure about this, but you know that &#34;related items&#34; thing that amazon puts on the bottoms of pages. I'm willing to bet it should include scarves, balaclavas and burkas.  ;)<br /><br />Pros: The lights are bright, but not blinding.<br />Battery or wall power<br />Light turns off after a set amount of time<br />Looks nice, easy to keep clean<br /><br />Cons:<br />The concave of the mirror itself means that there's a sweet spot where you can see clearly, but distortion happens along the edges in the magnification side.<br /><br /> The &#34;warm&#34; color is more yellow than I prefer.\n",
      "28->Can't use if you're undergoing fertility treatments or tanned. | 3 | 57 | “Do not use if you are pregnant, nursing, or undergoing fertility treatments.”<br /><br />“Do not treat if you have tanned skin. Tanned skin is at an increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices.”<br /><br />These are warnings that NIRA doesn’t indicate in any of their marketing, but which are included in the booklet you receive with purchase. The tanned skin comment is contrary to information on their website saying it's for all skin types.<br /><br />I purchased the device (not the serum) directly from the manufacturer for $200. They seem to offer a lot of promotions, so don’t buy this at full price (current msrp is $400, and they seem to offer 30% off all the time if you give them your email, my 50% off was a link from an influencer’s page on youtube). Tried reviewing on the main device page and got this notice: “Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this product. Due to this activity, we have limited this product to verified purchase reviews.” So that should tell us something about the quality of the reviews here. I can’t offer a review myself of the actual product because of the surprise contraindications. I had to give a star rating in order to post this review, so I just plugged in 3.<br /><br />Also, the website says to wait 1 minute before re-treating an area; the warning label says to wait at least 1 hour.\n",
      "29->works well, but has a minor design flaw | 4 | 57 | I have used ionizing brushes for over 30 years—since they were first sold by Sharper Image. The negative ions work very well to flatten the surface of the cuticle of each hair, making the hair less likely to break or split, and also softer.<br /><br />This particular brush works well, but the one I received has a minor design flaw: the brush part pops off so easily that I have to hold it tight with my thumb, making it less ergonomic than it might be... not an issue for me. As for the vibrating part, I couldn't tell, but that's not what I bought it for. This brush generates NO heat, which is exactly what I wanted. Unlike some similar products, there are NO seams that could catch the hair.<br /><br />TIPS FOR ALL IONIZING BRUSHES:<br />(1) if they don't need electricity (cord or batteries), they're not the real deal<br />(2) heating elements, just like heated blow-drying, tend to dry out your hair and make it more brittle: even oily hair can get dried out<br />(3) brush your hair SLOWLY to get the best result<br />(4) if your hair is flatter after using it, and you don't like that, bend over and brush it upside down to get more volume\n",
      "31->3-peat customer with no issues. | 4 | 55 | I'm allergic to aluminum so I have made my way through dozens of aluminum free deodorants and antiperspirants.  Some I've liked and some I've hated but this German Nivea, glass bottle, is legit.  Most all natural deodorants can't carry me through my day and into the gym but this one can.  With past brands I've told my friends at the gym, &#34;I'm using hippy deodorant today so if I smell like Pig Pen- that's why.&#34; Another bonus is that it's clear so I've never had an issue of it staining my clothes.<br /><br />This will be my 3rd purchase so I'm curious to see what I get because the first two were not the same label.  Both glass bottles but different scents.  I could really care less because they both worked the same and smelled pleasant.<br /><br />Just like I thought. I received my 3rd order today and they get a 4 of 5 just because I've never got the same labeling. Weird.\n",
      "35->This was a steal at this price!! | 5 | 52 | Eeeeeeekkk I'm so excited about this!! I love my Dry Bar Buttercup hair dryer, but really wanted a diffuser for it because I like to scrunch my hair time to time. When I added it to my cart, it was $21 I believe. That's still cheaper than Sephora so I was going to get it but waited. SO GLAD I DID. Randomly, it dropped to $12.12!!!! Purchased immediately!!<br /><br />It fits my hair dryer perfectly. But, I can tell by looking at it that my hair dryer isn't a standard size on the end so I had to purchase the Bio Ionic brand since that's who makes my hair dryer. Worth it! It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures). There will always be air flow on the outer ring of the diffuser, but you can completely close off the center, which is nice if you don't want a ton of force.<br /><br />I love it and it was completely worth it!\n",
      "36->It really works! But only at first. | 3 | 51 | UPDATE: it’s been a little over a month and this has definitely stopped working as well. There’s plenty left in the tube (I use it 2-3 days per week) and it goes on fine. However, when I spritz the fixative, the color bleeds a bit into my skin. It does wipe off. And then last night during dinner I noticed it wiping off onto my white napkin about 2hrs after application. By 6hrs later it was completely gone. Really disappointed and won’t be buying it again.<br /><br />I didn’t really think it would work, but it’s actually amazing! It’s a little hard to get it the right consistency the first time, but I’m better now. My photos are from my first application. From the top: nothing on my lips, Romance after about 30 seconds, with clear lip balm, next morning / 18hrs later (I bit my lip in my sleep). I really love this and will be buying other colors. I wish it were more affordable or they offered multi color packs, but so glad I found this lip stain!\n",
      "37->Thick hair, but U-tips are huge for fine hair. Removal breaks natural hair. Please see update! | 2 | 51 | My once beautiful long hair is finally growing back in from chemotherapy for breast cancer. I had had it bonded by my hair salon about 6 months ago with Cinderella bonds that shed like a cat almost immediately and had hair that was split and damaged before I ever even washed it.<br /><br />I took a chance on ordering 2-18 inch packs of #613 and 2-16 inch packs of #613 of Sunny hair. The hair looked beautiful and was a perfect match for my own color, but there is no way of telling until it's been washed, conditioned and blown out over a few weeks to really know how it will hold up.<br /><br />My stylist, who specializes in hot fusion bonds, put in 1 pack of the 18 inch Sunny hair (50 U tips) and one pack of Cinderella hair (25 U tips) 5 days ago. I have very fine hair and a tiny head, so more would not have been possible (this amount also equals a full head of hair for me). We are experimenting to see which hair holds up better.<br /><br />After one wash, conditioning and blow dry yesterday, the high priced Cinderella hair was tangling in the middle, while the Sunny hair stayed tangle-fee, but did shed quite a bit. The Sunny hair has more weight to it than the much more expensive hair though and combed out better.<br /><br />One star off for how huge the actual keratin U-tip are and the shedding. My stylist tried to cut some of the tip off with great difficulty. This is an FYI for those with fine hair or those who want to be able to pull it back without the bond showing (the more expensive type has much smaller Keratin u-tips).<br /><br />I will update this review after 4 weeks in, but for now, I'd like to thank other reviewers for their input as it helped me choose Sunny hair. You were all correct in saying the hair is thicker than most online hair, even though each strand is a bit different in strand width, health and quality. As the industry is unregulated, it's hard to know what you're getting and with blonde hair, just how much processing went into coloring the hair (causing damage).<br /><br />If my Sunny hair holds up well, my stylist, who does at least 10 hot fusion bondings per month on clients, will be ordering directly from Sunny hair instead of the company that charges $125-$150 per pack. We are both hoping this is the case.<br /><br />I hope others will try this brand  and leave reviews on their experiences. Also, if this is your first time with bonds, please remember on length that it's not going from the top of your head. The lower layers will fall much longer - I'm 5'7 with a long neck and the 18 inch lower tiers fall just a few inches above my waist.<br /><br />UPDATE: please don't buy this hair if you value your natural hair.<br />It's impossible to remove the bonds without breaking your own hair.<br />It breaks, frizzes, knots up like crazy if in a warm climate.<br />I loved those first packs until summertime. Absolutely awful in heat and humidity. I couldn't get a brush through the hair. It would just snap off. The knots were horrific. I had my hairdresser try to remove and this is more like crazy glue on the bond than keratin.\n",
      "40->Less than Great.... | 2 | 44 | I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately, it was less than great quality, and one of the brushes I received was broken. Quite a few of the brushes had frayed bristles and had uneven thickness to them, which made even application hard to come by.<br /><br />When I used some, it didn't seem like they blended the colors together well (mainly for eye shadow). I wish there were smaller round brushes for blending out shadows on your eyes because I feel like all the flat brushes are just about all the same. There is barely any size difference between three of them, and they can all be used for the same things so why not replace those with some rounder ones?<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller about the problems I had with this product, but, after two days, I haven't heard anything back from them. I was waiting before putting this review up to see if there was anything they cared to do to help with these problems (new brush that's not broken, or a new set all together that has better quality to them), but I have gotten no response back from them to lead me to believe that they're willing to do anything to help.<br /><br />I have attached photos to this post to show the problems I got with these brushes. The broken one was a foundation brush so I didn't get to try that one out to even see if it applied the foundation well, so I was a little disappointed with that. The larger powder brush seemed to do ok, but it didn't pick up powder that well. The larger fan brush I tried to use for contouring (I saw someone use a large fan brush for this purpose in a tutorial so I wanted to try it out), but even though the brush picked up the color, it didn't seem to apply it very much at all. The contour powder I used is super pigmented so I shouldn't have had that problem. The eye shadow brush I used (one of the smaller tapered brushes) actually worked pretty well so I don't have complaints about any of those except that some of the smaller brushes had frayed bristles, too. The smaller fan brush I used for highlight, and, though it did well with applying it, the unevenness of the bristles made it apply in a weird and uneven way, One of the larger tapered brushes I used to pack on a setting powder, but again, it didn't seem to pick it up well and left a ton of fall out once it hit my skin. I understand setting powder typically leaves fall out, but I've never experience so much before using this brush.<br /><br />Basically, the best brushes in this set were probably the eye shadow brushes.<br /><br />I hope this review helps give some insight on this product. I also hope the seller finds a way to fix the problems I had for future customers.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my 100% honest review. I tried contacting the seller (as noted above) before leaving this review since it's a poor one, but I made sure to leave enough information to work with and to help others decide whether or not they would like to purchase this product.\n",
      "41->Cute and Compact | 5 | 43 | Convenient and simple hair dryer. It comes with an attachment that you snap on. I must admit it’s not the easiest to slip on an off but does a good job or channeling the air.<br /><br />When I turned it in the highest setting there was a slight burn smell, which I’m not sure if that’s from the inner parts of the the heating up to produce the heat but I’ll have to keep my eye on it during long term use.<br /><br />The cool button option is pretty neat if the air gets too hot for your scalp, you can just hold it down to temporarily change the temperate.<br /><br />Update: I was told the burn smell is from protective oil protect in the dryer and after using several uses, the smell will disappear.

The steam only comes out in the front, and my hair is extremely wet in the front and extremely dry in the back of my head. What a disappointment.

      "59->Much better than a water based stone warmer | 5 | 35 | I bought this in summer time to decrease the temp in my massage room. Even with the ac cranked the excess heat from the hot stone warmer filled with water in my room was cooking me.<br />This stone warmer heats up in about 20-25 minutes, stays consistently warm and even after 8 hours the stones aren’t too hot to touch.<br />If you are a massage therapist and on the fence about this, treat yourself to this clamshell. Honestly one of my favorite tools I’ve purchased so far.\n",
      "66->Great variety but they dont stay in for long. | 2 | 32 | Updated review: I've changed my rating from a 4 to a 2 and the only reason it's not a 1 is because I love the variety. These peices dont stay in their hair. Not 1 piece has made it threw naptime or even a 10 minute car ride. I constantly have to redo or tighten them because they just slip out, no matter how tight. My daughter is 2 with hair passed her shoulders so Its not like im grasping at fuzz either. Definitely not worth the price.<br /><br />Ive been so excited for these and am not disappointed at all. I do have to say that I think the price is a bit steep for hair ties but i have yet to experience a break which is a huge plus.  I hate getting my 2 year olds hair just right and when i go to tie it up, the dang tie snaps. Iv used about 6 different ones so far and they've all kept their hold and didnt stretch out either. Love the variety, all the different colors and animals make it fun for my little one too, she likes picking them out on her own.\n",
      "72->A wonderful letdown... | 2 | 30 | After reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for these... I went on a 10-day hunting trip out in the boonies in Michigan's U.P. Stayed at a cabin with no electricity or running water, so I figured these would be a good replacement for a shower.<br /><br />They are very moist, was pleasantly surprised by that, but they failed to get rid of the stink. I typically use a natural tea-tree oil-based shower gel which is great for B.O. removal and since these were one of the few choices that contained TTO, I purchased them. Unfortunately, the TTO wasn't strong enough. Don't get me wrong, I did feel clean after using them! They have a pleasant smell and didn't leave me feeling greasy or sticky, but being a mildly-OCD woman who likes to be funk-free, these were a disappointment.<br /><br />I won't waste them, I'll probably give them to my sister-in-law to use for her babies, but I don't think I'd purchase them again...\n",
      "76->Pure Allure By Raquel Welch in SS 14/88 Golden Wheat $130 | 5 | 30 | When looking for a wig I always find pictures to be far more helpful than words. Hopefully the pictures I've included can help someone make a decision. This wig is less than a week (Took a bit of work to get rid of the shine to the point where I felt comfortable). I used dry shampoo and played with the style alot back combing etc..I have been wearing high end LONG human hair wigs so it was a stretch to try this, but I NEED to cut down on the money Im spending and $130 is much better. It has been awhile since I've ordered a Raquel Welch 1. Because I find &#34;Tru Life fibers do not last) especially when you add heat 2. Her wigs move around on me even with/without wig caps, wig bands, It Stays..etc..So I buy combs and clips and sew them in myself just like on a lace wig (its actually much easier on these)..<br />Im happy with this for the price, the fact that it was PRIME and here in 1-2 Days🎈yea!!.. and would order another BUT it does shed quite a bit which is bothering me considering its 3/4 days old.<br />I like where this wig falls on me (which will be different on everyone). The piece that keeps falling in my face is driving me crazy but I will keep &#34;training&#34; it.  Pics are taken in in several different lightings.  There is an RL 14/88 and SS 14/88.. This is the SS..Hope this helps someone..\n",

My pain was so intense that I had and MRI done and then a visit to the neurosurgeon. Diagnosis was that I have bulging discs, arthritis and some slight stenosis but not yet a candidate for surgery.

      "79->This is my second Straightener Brush ever | 5 | 30 | However, as far as products go... I really love everything about the way this company presents itself, it's design, it's product and how well the product performs. It has a great warranty (my last one from a different company died in less than 5 months with no recourse), and it came with a bunch of great stuff, including this weird little paddle (the green & white thing) I couldn't figure out at first was a cleaning utensil, and now I really love. It helps you pull the hair from the brush.<br /><br />At almost 30 years old this year, I had spent most of my life hating my hair with a passion. I would wear hats, I would wear wigs, I could not figure out anything that could make me happy... and it's because I was completely inept with styling tools and doing anything that wasn't simple.  So I was beyond happy when someone recommended a straightening brush to me in the first place. Then I stumbled upon the best heat protection spray/frizz stuff ever... and I don't know what happened, for the first time in my life, I'm confident with my hair. So if you're on the fence about getting one of these, because you really have tried \"everything\" and you still hate your hair....I don't know, maybe try a straightener brush. All you do is brush your hair with it....and it changes things a lot.<br /><br />This brush though. I can not have enough good things to say about it. It came with everything! A heat protection glove (especially great if you have thick hair like me and need to go all the way up to 450 degrees!), the cleaning tool, a silicone bag to protect it, OH and the cord swivels. I absolutely love the shape and curve of the actual brush, and the sturdiness of the design. I can't see this thing actually needing replacing any time soon, honestly... and that makes me happy because I'm tired of buying stuff on Amazon and having it fail on me.<br /><br />Of all the purchases in the past 2 years on here I've made, this is easily one of, if not the best.... and I wanted to share the pictures of what it does to my hair, so you can see. That is what my hair looks like after being blow dried, and then straightened with this brush, which doesn't take long at all. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and my hair is super thick.\n",
      "82->Affordable & Pretty | 4 | 30 | [[VIDEOID:c7ea1ada61f6bc13ccf9a564082e2c55]] I have relaxed hair & decided to order the 10 inch kinky straight clip in extensions. I hoped the kinky texture would be similar to my own hair but it was not. In my opinion, this feels like Indian hair that has been crimped. Very silky, very soft, & affordable so I'm not mad. I haven't noticed any shedding and I only needed to use 3 pieces since I was only trying to add a little length. The clips are very secure feeling in my hair & it was super easy to install myself. I am definitely a newbie to hair extensions so if you're nervous about being able to do this yourself, don't be!! I will say the hair did smell like burnt hair. Ya know the salon smell with all the hot tools on? Yeah that's the smell lol. Also I will note that it is very difficult to straighten the hair from the weft to about 5 inches down. If I would've known the hair wasn't a truly kinky texture, I would have gone with the regular straight. Overall I'm very happy with the product! I recommend highly.<br /><br />Oh and sidenote: just for those who may be wondering. You can totally put your hair up with these clip ins. I do suggest getting a longer length though for a ponytail or high bun. No less than 14 inches in my opinion. Also if you're looking to add fullness to your hair, I'd recommend buying 2 sets. As stated earlier, I just wanted a little length in the back b/c my hair is already super thick so one set worked perfect for me.\n",
      "84->Great Stuff, but Expensive | 4 | 29 | The only thing important on this product is the active ingredient chlorexidine. The standard concentration is 2%. Hibiclens is an &#34;overkill&#34; at 4%. Regardless, here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES on this chemical agent.<br />.<br />.<br />ADVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser - the &#34;gold standard&#34; in the opinion of numerous medical people. According to all available literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens and disintegrates the bacterial cell membrane wall, thus destroying the organism. Because human and animal tissues are also negatively charge, the agent binds to the skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth.<br />. . . The antiseptic properties only affect organisms on the skin. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY's &#34;Penetration of Chlorhexidine into Human Skin&#34; reported &#34;poor penetration of chlorhexidine into skin following 2 min. and 30 min. exposures to chlorhexidine was observed.&#34; In other words, the agent is relatively safe because it does not penetrate the skin and get absorbed into human tissue or the blood stream and cause damage or toxic chemical reactions.<br />.<br />2. Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%.<br />.<br />In most hospitals, physicians scrub their hands with this agent before surgery. Also, patients must wash with this agent on the evening and morning before their operations.<br />.<br />3. A 2% solution is the recommended concentration to be used for surgical scrubbing according to EPIC and CDC guidelines. This maybe an overkill for consumer usage. As a skin cleanser, THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS NURSING reported that anything over a 0.5% concentration showed &#34;no significant differences statistically, including persistent effects within 24 hours.&#34; A lower strength of 0.2% was just as effective according to INT. ENDED J. 2001. The only difference is speed. A 0.2% concentration takes 1 min. to completely kill E. Faccalis while a 2% concentration takes 30 sec.<br />. . . The ineffective limit is a 0.12% concentration. This does not kill E. Faccalis. The above findings were replicated and confirmed by a more recent U.S. study in J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb.<br />. . . For oral rinsing, it is a different matter because the mouth is not covered by skin but mucus membrane. It is also host to different germs. The standard treatment is a 0.12% chlorhexidine concentration. However, optimum effects require a higher concentration. Clinical trials reported by THE JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY said that a 1% concentration &#34;showed a significant reduction through intensive treatment (3-4 daily applications over 2 days) or through daily application for 10 and 14 days.&#34;<br />.<br />4. Because a 0.2% concentration is just as effective as &#34;straight out of the bottle,&#34; a 2% chlorhexidine can be diluted with water to yield ten times the amount of usable disinfectant. Also, a 4% Hibiclens concentration can yield 20 times the amount.<br />.<br />5. Hibiclens is overpriced. The cheapest on amazon.com is $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive. . . . It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of the stuff.<br />.<br />A cheaper alternative is to buy a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate from a pet products vendor. The cheapest is sold by Greener Pastures Veterinary Service Store for $8.25/gallon. If the user purchases $100+, there is free 2-day shipping.<br />.<br />6. Among most chlorhexidine literature from manufacturers, they recommend one to two ounces to a gallon of cleaning solution for sanitizing floors, counter-tops, and furniture. In addition, anecdotal testimonies from pet owners, stores, and clinics report a reduction in sicknesses among animals when the solution is used to clean their cages, skin, and gums.<br />. . . This is surprising. One ounce of chlorhexidine to a gallon of water amounts to a 0.03125% solution. According to a study by the J. INFUS. NURS. 2012 Jan.-Feb., E. Faccalis bacteria was smeared on glass cones. A 0.12% chlorhexidine concentrate failed to kill the strain. It required a 0.2% or higher to do the job.<br />. . . Based on these facts, the only possible conclusion is that the weaker concentration does not directly kill existing bacteria but creates a hostile environment for germ growth. The chemical inhibits the spread of dangerous organisms on the skin, mouth, and inorganic surfaces. Through time, the noxious population is further reduced. Thus, it becomes less dangerous to the host.<br />.<br />7. J. ACQUIR. IMMUNE. DEFIC. SYNDR. 2004 Feb. 1 reported that a 0.25% concentration is well tolerated by women, even in the sensitive vaginal area. At 1% concentration, there were 13% complaints of burning and itching.<br />.<br />.<br />DISAVANTAGES<br />.<br />1. The product has risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes ulceration damages.<br />.<br />2. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction: irritation and redness. Washing the affected area with soap and water will negate the problems within 72 hours.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.<br />.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS<br />.<br />Based on two medical studies, a water dilution of chlorhexidine to a 0.2% concentration is the minimum for eliminating microbial organisms. Leave it on for a 1 minute. As an added bonus, the 0.2% concentration is well tolerated, even in the vaginal area of females. . . . If you want a quick guaranteed kill, use a 0.5% concentration.<br />.<br />For inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria on counter-tops, floors, pet cages, and animals, one-to-two ounces of 2% chlorhexidine to a gallon of water &#34;will do the job.&#34; Again, this only reduces the germ population by restrict\n",

      "97->It worked for me | 4 | 27 | I have used this to treat some rogue hairs on my face and have been successful. The hairs are on my cheek bones above my beard line, nose tip, between my eyebrows and a single one on my ear. Many of them have not grown back in a month after first treatment. I treat every 1-2 weeks. Whatever does come back I have treated again and there is less to treat each time.<br /><br />It's more tedious than IPL for sure, but the success rate per treated hair seems good. Also you can be very precise with this.<br /><br />My technique is:<br />Grind some salt in a mortar and pestle to get a fine salt powder, put it in a small container with filtered water. Get a small container and put rubbing alcohol in it. For the container I just use a two sided measuring spoon from my kitchen. Maybe an old contact lense case would work good too, just don't use it for contacts after. Clean my face, then use my fingers to spread rubbing alcohol on the follicles I'm going to treat. Dip and wisk the end of the electrolysis pen in the rubbing alcohol to clean it. Get in front of a well lit mirror and table. Make sure the tip of the electrode is perfectly straight and fully extended - - mine was a little curved at the end and needed straightening. Dip into the salt water solution the index finger that is on the hand that will hold the pen. Hold the pen on the plastic parts with your other fingers. Fully insert the electrode into the follicle to treat. Touch your salty index finger on the metal band to electrify the electrode. You will hear a buzzing for a few seconds, then a pause, then buzzing again. The pause means treatment for that follicle is done and you can move on to the next. Though for good measure sometimes I prolonged the treatment of each follicle for an additional 1-2 buzzes, I don't know if it's necessary. Maybe that's best reserved for stubborn hairs. You will see some white puss looking fluid come out of the follicle, supposedly that's lye, which kills the follicle. When done with all of your hairs for the session, take a pause before tweezing hairs and cleaning your face. Here is a good time to put away your tools, brush your teeth or whatever. Sanitize your probe with rubbing alcohol. Meanwhile this will give the lye time to work, let's say it's 5-10 minutes. Then you tweeze the hairs and clean your face. You can use your extra rubbing alcohol to wipe on your hair follicles to help sanitize them.<br /><br />Another tip, make sure your probe is fully in the follicle during the shock. The probe needle should dissappear inside, and your skin should not dimple inward from the probe pushing it down. Don't touch the skin with the probe sleeve/nozzle, but be very close. You can also use two hands to hold the probe for stability. Your dominant hand can hold the top part of the pen, and your other hand hold the tapered bottom part and brace the side of your hand against your face. I have shaky hands and this helped me to keep the probe in place.<br /><br />My nose tip hairs seemed to all die out in 1-2 treatments. Cheeks I started with a lot but each time it gets easier with less and less hair. That single ear hair was one and done. Between eyebrows, I started with a bit of a monobrow but it's getting very thin. Overall a success and I plan to continue to treat other areas in the future.\n",
      "99->Multi purpose pain relief | 2 | 27 | Not only is this cream good for pain due to inflammation but it is at its best for any type of burn including sunburn.  Used in conjunction with aloe it will relieve the pain almost instantly.  If put on sunburn promptly  it will lessen if not totally eliminate peeling.  I use this product with others because it has the ability to help absorbsion  of other medicines into the skin.  A word of caution when using this product,  make sure your hands are clean when applying this product as anything on them will be absorbed with the dmso into your skin.  I keep a jar of this in my medicine cabinet at all times and have been using it for years.  It is truly amazing stuff.<br />Bill Kailua Kona Hawaii\n",
      "100->Needs better instructions - doesn't have self timer! But does clean well | 4 | 27 | I've been using my Clarisonic on and off for the past few years and it's a pain to purchase the replacement brushes for that. It also kind of grosses me out that the bacteria can live in those bristles..the ones that are supposed to DEEP CLEAN you face! I've been wanting to try the Foreo Luna for a while but that costs $200!  this item looks almost identical to that Luna cleansing brush. My friend uses her Luna and swears by it now. I compared hers to this one and i think the shape of this facial brush is a lot more practical since it comes to that point at the top which is great around the eye, nose, mouth areas. However, looking at the Luna bristles and the bristles on this unit you can tell the Luna has their bristles closer and also has a great variety of  brush levels which their claim is to more efficiently cleanse the skin meeting the specific needs of different facial areas... compared to the Sytles II, this unit only has 2 types of bristles.  The Luna says it cleanses with 8,000 pulsations per minute, but this unit says it can &#34;reach 32,000 times per minute massage design if high frequency vibration&#34; ...which i'm not sure how true that is..and what that even means.... what is 32,000 times? What is it referring to?...this leads me to my other gripe with this product...........the instructions!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish this unit had BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...I was reading it and i'm so confused - it doesn't say how many modes it has and what each mode is used for..but it mentions &#34;modes&#34; have eight gears?<br /><br />Here's the &#34;operation&#34; instructions..please try to decipher what it means... and yes i know there's typos..but that is how it READS on the instruction manual...&#34;each mode has eight gear, may adjust the intensity according to your needed. According to the intermediate key open product cleaning mode for the first tiem. According to the second closed products the intensity of each mode can be though the + and - buttons to increase&#34;............excuse me what? anyway ...<br /><br />Here are my instructions!!!<br />1.) Charge the unit to full before first use. Flashing means it's charging and when it stops blinking it is fully charged.<br /><br />2.) Wet the unit and your face, apply some face wash and turn the unit on to cleanse your whole face for 2 minutes. This unit has 2 modes, cleanse and massage. When you press on the button between the - and + you have it on cleanse mode (the faster vibration) and you can adjust the vibration intensity higher or lower depending on what you prefer. When you press the middle button again it turns off ..when you press it one more time it will turn onto the massage mode (slower vibration) you can adjust the speed of vibration in this mode as well.<br />  -The unit does NOT have a self timer so don't expect this unit to shut off after 2 minutes of cleaning. It also says it has &#34;acoustic cleaning&#34; which i thought meant it would beep every 30 seconds indicating you should move to another part of your face (ex. left cheek, right cheek, chin and then forehead - like the clarisonic does) but does NOT so you need to keep track of how long you want to wash your face for with this.<br /><br />3) Shut the unit off when you're finished by clicking the middle button between the - and +. Pat the unit dry or leave it where it can air dry.<br /><br />One thing i like about this type of facial brush is that you don't need to replace any brush heads on this unit - it makes for more hygienic. This Styles II facial brush also claims to reverse signs of aging and restoring youth in your skin. I'm only 27 so i can't really speak to this claim, i don't have may wrinkles but i hope this is a great start for preventative measures.<br /><br />This unit also claims to be a durable travel sized facial brush - it feels very light weight which i like because i don't want a bulky unit, i really like that the cord is very small and doesn't need a stand charging unit like the clarisonic. I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use. When you plug it in you will see the light at the bottom to start flashing indicating that it is actively charging. I hope this unit will last forever as it claims - wouldn't that be AMAZING! :)<br /><br />I've already used this unit last night and i can say that my face felt very smooth and clean afterwards. I think it really preps the skin well for your serums and treatments at night, which is KEY for those products to work. If you don't exfoliate and clean your skin - it won't allow your products to actively work!<br /><br />I'm really excited for the 100% money back guarantee! I've only had this unit for one night so I don't know how i like it yet for the long term but I'm glad that this warranty is here in case it doesn't work well for my skin or if it breaks....<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Compact and easy to travel with<br />• Cute color!<br />• Comes with a charging cable ...which it came with a case too.<br />• Waterproof so you can use it in the shower<br />• Rechargeable - you can see the image where I'm charging the unit and the light is blinking. Once it stops blinking i'm assuming that is when it's fully charged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• The plug for the adapter to connect seems like it could rip over time - you can see it in the picture, it's very flimsy...<br />• The user manual has very odd grammar and is hard to understand which side is for &#34;massaging&#34; and which side if for &#34;cleansing&#34;.  PLEASE edit your instructions so we all understand how to properly use it.<br />• Does NOT have a self timer and it does NOT beep to indicate when to move to another part of your face like the clarisonic or Luna do.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. I love face products and purchasing things on Amazon so this is truly my honest review.  I think this is worth the $40 price tag for what it does. All in all - the Styles II facial brush does clean the face well, the vibrations are something to get used to.\n",
      "102->Love it... but has one flaw. | 5 | 27 | The diffuser is great, it's pretty and it has a nice large reservoir so it lasts awhile. It puts off a good amount of scent. Unless the room is totally dark though, you cant see that it lights up. Which maybe some people like that.. I didnt care either way... just making readers aware.  Overall, a good diffuser, esp for the price, I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />** One flaw is that it's very hard to get the top off. My hands are fairly small, and due to the coned shape there is no easy way to get a grip on the lid.  The first time trying my hand kept slipping off... I literally couldn't get the top off. I had to use my nails and grab the seam. Eventually I worked the lid off, but once theres water in it, i couldnt do that again because i had to lay it sideways to do this.<br /><br />Now that I've used it several time the lid comes off easier, but in my opinion, there should have been some kind of lip on the back to hold onto.<br /><br />If you have larger hands, you probably wont have a problem. My husband got the lid off with no issues.\n",
      "107->Best electric I've had | 4 | 26 | This Norelco (actually made by Philips) one was bought to replace an older shaver (I've used Norelco, Philips and Panasonics over the years.) This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter. What do you know- this time, &quot;new and improved&quot; really is accurate!<br />What I like: the shaver fits the hand well, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well. The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!) They have also &quot;shrunk&quot; the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug / charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.<br />What I don't like: the pop-up trimmer is only fair - it works, but it's actually not as effective as the one on my old shaver! The deep well holding the head rotors shafts is not so easy to clean with a brush, particularly with the hinged head; they are still using a non-user replaceable NiCd battery; the gimmicky cutter head plate section with holes seems merely that - gimmicky, not useful for any real shaving.<br />Tips: After cleaning the head / blade assemblies, allow them to dry fully and spray-lubricate with something like &quot;Shaver Saver.&quot; When power seems low, turn the shaver on and allow to discharge fully before reccharging - these are, after all, still NiCd batteries with the &quot;memory&quot; effect. These tips have allowed my previous electrics' battery - and cutter head assemblies - to last a long time (I have a heavy beard - even with a blade shaver, I have to shave again in the afternoon if I have a dinner appointment.)<br />Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used. It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do. Given the several deficits, I'd never give it four stars if not for how it handles its ultimate function - shaving my beard.\n",
      "111->Smooth Shave + Hair Conditioner Trick😄 | 4 | 25 | Never had razor bump/ingrown hair issues shaving around my flower🌸 but as we get a lil older our bodies just do weird things😒.<br /><br />Long story short..I got horrible razor rashes after last two shaves😫 and decided to give a different kind of razor a chance👀, rather than the cute pink drug store ones lol and I was scared this would be too sharp but it is SUPER smooth and safe....even AGAINST THE GRAIN😅!!<br /><br />Just wish they added a rubber piece for added grip for those that get a bit scared when slippery soap or shaving cream gets added to the mix. >>I actuly used hair conditioner bc I googled shaving cream hacks as I dont like chemicals; so I just used w.e conditioner i had that has safe ingredients..kids hair conditioner 😂lol..worked so well!! :)\n",

      "114->but once you've got it figured out it works great.

      "121->Don't buy it for the vacuum | 2 | 24 | This popped up in my gold box, and I decided to give it a whirl since the idea of trimming my beard with no mess had a lot of appeal. The vacuum does half work.  Unfortunately, catching half the mess won't change the need for clean-up--there's less to clean, but you'll still need to do it.  So my main recommendation is that you shouldn't let the vacuum \"feature\" be your reason for buying this.  If anything, it's a slight negative, because the opening for the vacuum gets in the way when you are doing edge trimming without the attachment.<br />The next down-side is the \"memory\" rechargeable batteries.  Basically, unless you let the batteries completely discharge before recharging, they will hold less and less charge each time.  This is mentioned in the folded up piece of paper that passes for a manual--you will want to read through that.  Which leads me to my final gripe:  That piece of paper is extremely poorly done--diagrams with no explaination, unclear instructions, etc.  So you do have to read it, but you're going to spend some time trying to puzzle it out before you actually figure it out.<br />For all my complaining, the trimmer isn't completely without merit.  It does do a decent job of trimming my beard, which is of course the main point of the thing.  I also didn't have any real noise complaints, which seems to be an issue for other reviewers.<br />On balance though, my main recommendation would be don't pay for the vacuum, because you won't be getting what you paid for.\n",
      "126->deplaner wand= razor handle. Just use a razor | 1 | 24 | I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don't want to sound cynical, but I really don't want  you to spend money where you don't have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive \"deplaning tools\" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, \"WAND\") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, \"deplaning\" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it \"deplaning\") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, \"deplaning blade\") in each handle (ie; \"wand\"). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The \"wands\" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the \"instructions for use\" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.\n",
      "127->Didn't work for me, but not a bad product | 2 | 23 | Unfortunately I was not a fan of this dry shampoo... I have very fine hair, but a LOT of it. I am also just a very oily person. This means that within 24 hrs my hair starts to look limp and greasy so dry shampoo is a necessity for me. I used Oscar Blandi dry shampoo (the non-aerosole version) to great success, but it seems to have been discontinued (bummer!). So I decided to try this dry shampoo.<br /><br />Pros: Its a decent amount/size for the price and the organic thing is nice. Also, the bottle was easy to use. Its basically a super cheap salt shaker - but hey, it totally works!<br /><br />Cons: The smell. This is super subjective, so it might be fine for others. I hated the smell. It smelled sort of spicy/musky to me - or sort of reminded me of patchouli (which I'm just not a fan of). The first time I wore this to work, I was sitting at my desk, and a coworker came over to look at something on my computer screen. She leaned in, so her face was right above the top of my head. She said she smelled something really weird, like burning hair. I'm pretty sure she was smelling this product in my hair, and that's not something anyone wants to be told they smell like. Another con - I was not a fan of the formula. I think that it wasn't as fine as I would it need to it be to work for me. It also just seemed to clump up wherever I sprinkled it, instead of blending in and spreading out (after shaking my hair out) like other dry shampoos I've used.\n",
      "129->Works great, but... (read to end for final update) | 3 | 23 | It's too soon for me to tell if this is really working but the surface of my nails looks better.<br /><br />The problem I have is with the applicator.  They use a lip gloss applicator and the fuzz started coming off the first time I used it.  I am now using bare plastic to apply it.  (just ordered some eyeliner wands to replace...hope they fit the tube)<br /><br />GONNA JUMP IN HERE WITH MY LATEST UPDATE IN CASE YOU'RE TEMPTED TO STOP READING.  Still love this product and....YAAAYYYYY....my latest (direct) order has BRUSHES instead of foam/fuzz things on the wands.  They earned a fifth star for this.  So happy!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Three months later and all the peeling areas on my nails are gone.  I've had no more splitting and my nails are definitely stronger (I insist on using them inappropriately sometimes and they no longer show signs of wear and tear at their tips.)<br /><br />I think the people upset with lack of progress are either not using the product as recommended (twice a day) or just aren't waiting enough time.  This is not an overnight fix or a magic \"blink and your nails will be longer\" elixir.  Your nails need to grow normally but, being stronger, will attain length without breaking.<br /><br />NOTE:  I file my nails daily (in one direction) with a fine glass file to make sure there are no rough edges from day to day.  I've done this for years, though...it's not the reason my nails are so much better now.<br /><br />Expensive? Yes.  Worth it?  Absolutely.<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE: Since I also use a cuticle oil that supposedly has strengthening properties, I decided to ask the Rejuvica people two questions (separate customer service representatives). This product does NOT penetrate the nail...it stays on the surface.  And if you wash your hands, the product washes off. I'm going to stop using this product when it runs out.  If my nails suffer, I'll go back to using it but put some kind of protective wax product over it immediately.  If my nails continue to look good, I'll just stick with my cuticle oil (Barefoot Scientist).\n",

      "134->Can't win them all | 2 | 23 | Let me start by saying that I really like the New York Biology brand of skin care products. Much of what they produce is on the cutting edge of scientific research. I am a huge fan of transgenic pharming so do not think my opinion is based on that.  And although this I feel is a good cream for Acne prone skin, the actual scar removal benefits may be lacking.<br />EGF ( Epidermal growth factor) Is a cytokine (chemicals our cells use to communicate with each other) There are many however EGF helps repair damage to the skin. (Yes this is a real thing and it works, but it needs to get to where is needs to be effective). I was debating on how complicated to make this review because It took me 3 hours and a call to a specialist to help me form my opinion of this product, but most people do not want or require extensive data.<br />  Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a 6.2 kDa polypeptide, It is not huge but is to large to absorbe properly. Your body makes and delivers EGF from the inside so this absorption factor is null.  Assuming that any topically applied EGF reaches the dermis, it would be a minute fraction of that applied, and thus not likely to affect collagen production.  Also, wrinkle reduction requires not just the making of new collagen, but also the breakdown and disposal of old collagen. That is the role of a different group of cytokines (growth factors), and their target cells, some of which are phagocytes (immune cells that gobble up debris and export it).<br /> So no I do not believe despite the great innovative ingredients that this will be a miracle cure for my acne scars, but It will provide a great moisturizer for acne prone skin. There is a lot of science to back that up, but we don't have all day.<br />  BTW, If you want to know more or you have new evidence to the contrary, I would love to chat about it. I will be testing this, but I fear it will not live up to my already high expectations created by their many other skin products.<br />  I was lucky enough to be able to receive a small discount in exchange for an honest review of this product, but that in no way shape or form influenced my opinion. And believe me If my opinion of this product changes after months of use or whatever, I will Update the review and blast this product.<br />  If you have any questions feel free to message me and if this review was helpful please push the &#34;helpful button&#34;. I like to know If my reviews are making a difference.\n",
      "135->Slow process, but good results | 4 | 23 | I was nervous about getting this. There are SO MANY models and brands and reviews out there that I finally decided on one that was within my price range to try, but also had decent reviews. I've had this now for about 4 months and have not had any re-growth of the hairs I've taken out. That's what I was looking for - lasting results. That being said, it is tricky to get used to doing this. It's best if you have someone doing it for you. There are a couple of things to keep in mind: 1. You go one hair at a time, and each one took me about 3-4 minutes, and the instructions say not to do more than a square inch of skin at a time. So depending on how much of an area you want to do, and how dense the hair is it may take months and months to clear a significant area, and that's if you do it every other day. 2.) You will have unsightly sores. You are penetrating your epidermis and electrocuting the hair follicle, so you will get a scab on each pore you zap. I used the Tea Tree lotion they recommend on Amazon and it seemed to work fine. I don't know if it would have been the same without the oil. My scabs were there the same amount of time any other scab I've had has been on me - about a week.<br /><br />So it's slow going and leaves scabs, but once the scabs went away my hair has not come back at all. It's been great that way! I'm really glad I bought it. The reasons I didn't give five stars is because it said, &#34;Clean and Easy&#34;. It's not easy, and when something leaves you scabbed over, that doesn't scream &#34;clean&#34; to me. The other reason is because I had to zap each follicle twice on the highest setting before it worked. But I gave it four stars because it did work! So for the price, and once you get used to it, and if you have a way to hide the scabs for a week, then it's great. I'm happy with the results, which for me is the bottom line.\n",
      "136->Waste of time: simply does not clean your teeth | 1 | 22 | It is important that you clean your teeth properly and this sure ain't gonna help in any meaningful way.<br /><br />The so-called \"wireless\" charging consists of a base you plug into a USB adapter (not supplied) which has 4 metal contacts on the top. To charge the device you stand it so that two contacts on the underside of the base make contact with two on the base. It's pretty basic and falls over quite easily.<br /><br />Once charging is started a pretty (pointless) blue and white light pulses gently for several hours.<br />After charging is complete you can use this to clean your teeth, by putting the \"brush\" in your mouth and turning it on. The only problem is that it doesn't do a good job. Various presses of the one button make a blue light come on and the whole device vibrate gently. This is totally insufficient to clean your teeth.<br /><br />I persevered with this for several days and my teeth felt horrible, like I hadn't brushed then at all.<br /><br />In summary - worthless.\n",
      "140->very happy with the product | 5 | 22 | My second bottle, very happy with the product. Not as long lasting as drysol, but also not as harsh with less burn and less dry skin. When you use this product use it as directed and be prepared to use lotion where ever you use it on you body the next morning after you wash it of.<br /><br />The first part of my body that sweats long before I'm actually hot is also the most visible, my forehead. Its embarrassing and it also happens to be the part of my body that sweats the most when I am actually hot, to the point of wiping my forehead results in sweat flinging of my hand. With this spray I feel confident going into public on hot days knowing I wont be embarrassed.<br /><br />This spray is also very effective at controlling foot odor, %90 of foot odor is caused by your feet sweating.\n",
      "143->Looks cool, but quickly overwhelmed. | 3 | 22 | The Goldbox offer (half price) suckered me into buying this model, despite recently having happily switched away from Norelco to the Braun 360 Complete. One of the advantages of the Braun was the much better handling of longer whiskers as the occasional 1-week-slump generates. Hoping that the hype of the new shaving heads resolved this issue, I eagerly tried out the Arcitec. It's still completely overwhelmed and no competition for the Braun at all. For the daily shave, the Arcitec 1059X is quite able to provide a reasonable shave.<br /><br />The design may be the main reason to get this model as the shape and the cool display are likely to grace every bathroom. It's modernistic, yet understated. Yes, this is one of the best looking shavers on the market! The shaving head is fairly flexible and adapts to contours well, As with any dry shaver I tried so far, it won't match a wet blade, but it's not bad either. In fact, with restricting the whiskers to a one or two day length, the results are fairly comparable to the Braun 360 which so far yielded the best results for me. Then again, past that point, the Braun is a clear winner loosing only to a wet blade (again).<br /><br />Handling of the Arcitec is reasonable and style concerns certainly overrode function, but still to a subtle degree that's acceptable albeit not perfect. Battery life is excellent and the charging stand has actual suction cups to make it easier to keep the base planted on the counter top. There is also a travel case included which doubles as a charging cradle. (The power supply plugs into the case and contacts allow the razor to be charged when plugged in.)<br /><br />Overall mostly a cool design and quite functional for the daily chore. However, if you're less diligent with your shaving schedule it's hopelessly overwhelmed with the longer (and thicker) whiskers. The lift'n'cut feature is standard for Norelco and reasonably effective. However, it also irritates the skin a bit more.\n",
      "150->Unexpectedly Pretty Color | 5 | 21 | I am already a fan of Josie Maran's color stick in Rosy which I purchased at Sephora late in 2010. I still have half of it left and expect I will run out of it sometime in mid-2013. What a way to stretch a dollar!  I saw this color, Love, which is not available in the store, and was attracted to what appears to be more of an earthy, rich and darker color than Rosy. I ordered it and it arrived yesterday. I was disappointed to find a pale mauvish color and did not have high hopes for how it would look on me, as I have never liked mauve colors on me. This morning I tried it anyway, fully expecting to hate it. Within about 20 minutes I noticed the most natural-looking vibrant bloom in my cheeks, attributable only to this! I love the silky texture  and it does not feel sticky or greasy on my face at all.  Just pure healthy moisturizing (thanks to the argan oil in it) color that I am so glad to have. It has more of a matte effect  on the skin than does Rosy, which is more glossy and sheer. Both colors last all day on my face, even in extreme heat and humidity.<br /><br />The price may seem expensive but considering my first one is still fresh and going strong after 19 months, it's actually a steal! Smells pleasant, too - rather like fresh berries. Just be aware that it is not going to be the dark berry color shown in the photograph.\n",
      "154->Not Your Ordinary Massage Chair | 5 | 20 | Update:  I’ve owned this chair for more than two years. My children won’t leave it alone. They raise it, ride it like a toy, climb on it, everything they can think of and I use it daily. It still functions, looks and feels like brand new. I’m even happier with this purchase now than I was then.<br /><br />Some Assembly Required...seriously?  I had to click the base into the pole and the seat on top of it.  I read the instructions 4 times because I knew it couldn't possibly be that easy...it was.  :)  And, I love my seat!  It replaced an 'office chair' I had at my desk.  The saddle stool is many times more convenient.  When not in use, it slides fully under my desk.  When in use, it's completely comfortable and relaxing to sit on.  As a bonus, it keeps my shoulders and back accessible for my boyfriend to give me a nice massage while I'm working.  LOVE IT!

      "156->Some pretty colors...but too glittery | 4 | 20 | Let me preface this by saying that the colors are pretty and generally well pigmented (I use it with Too Faced Shadow Insurance).  My issue is that many of the colors are very glittery - I like shimmery shadows, but we are talking big chunks of glitter here in several of the colors.  If you're familiar with Urban Decay's \"Midnight Cowgirl\" shadow family you'll get the picture.  Basically the entire palette is gliterry, except for two matte shades. If you get this, make sure to put a tissue under your eyes to catch the fall-out or you'll look like a disco ball.  I'm talking serious fall-out here.<br /><br />The colors are:<br /><br />Full Moon: Glittery Champagne<br />Night Light:  Supremely Glittery rosey pink (this one has a chalky texture, making it impossible to apply without massive fallout.)<br />Spotlight: Matte Beige<br />Nightcap: Shimmery medium tan<br />After Hours:  Chalky glittery medium beige<br />Moonstone:  Glittery deep tan<br />Cocoa Star:  Matte chocolate brown<br />Eclipse: Glittery Chestnut brown<br />Night Fever: Glittery Chocolate brown<br /><br />The positives:  The packaging is cute, the colors are fairly pigmented, Too Faced includes looks cards so you can get ideas on looks.<br /><br />The negatives:  This is only a good palette if you already have a nice collection of eyeshadow and you want something to throw in your purse when you're going out of town and know you'll be partying (and you have the patience to deal with massive fallout).  You can definitely make some work appropriate looks, but these are more glittery than shimmery, making it a bit juvenile.  Some of the shadows are chalky too. I also have the Urban Decay Naked palette and the colors are MUCH better, as is the quality of the shadows.  Personally I think Naked is also a better deal.  It's $50, so $14 more, but you get more colors, the shadows are better quality (creamier and smoother), and it comes with a nice brush.<br /><br />I find that I don't use this palette much.  It isn't a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup collection.<br /><br />Updated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I've definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.  I just don't LOVE it.  The problem is, I have the Urban Decay Naked palette.  The colors are similar between UD Naked and TF Natural at Night (warm browns and champagnes) but the Urban Decay colors are shimmers (I love shimmers) and many of the shads in the Too Faced Naked at Night palette are glitters.  That makes the TF colors much harder to work with due to fallout.  Ultimately, this palette is 3.5 stars to me.  It has nice colors and you can create some great looks (provided you put tissue under your eyes to catch the fallout), but the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.\n",
      "157->Worth the purchase! | 4 | 20 | I have a toddler, I need a no-slip option for the tub. I searched, for a good option that was also cost effective. I didn't want a mat - to me, they are too thick and get grimmey/slimey around the suction cups. This was a fun print that is also a good alternative. I had to buy 2 packs (I bought 1 turtle and 1 penguin pack) so there would be enough to fit my standard sized tub.<br /><br />Pros: The colors are vibrant and don't quickly fade (I am writing this review almost 2 months after purchase/install... 2-3 showers are taken daily in the tub where these are located). These stuck easily and have adhered nicely - they have not moved or lifted (i put these in when the tub was clean and dry). My toddler likes that there are animals in the tub. The no-slip surface isn't too rough and it does prevent slips!<br /><br />Cons: I just wish there were more in a package - I had to buy 2 packs which wasn't the worst thing because I was able to get a 2nd print. A variety pack would also have been nice with a few different animal prints instead of all one print but I still love this purchase!<br /><br />Did you find this review helpful? Let me know!\n",
      "158->Great deal, love these polishes, but nearly identical to another quad | 3 | 20 | I love Zoya polishes, and the holiday quads are a fantastic deal, when 1 bottle goes for $10 normally.  I would have loved this, except 3 of the 4 are almost identical to the pinks in another holiday quad, even though names are different.  The colors also appear differently in the description photos, Zoya website, and other reviews.<br /><br />Overall, the quad price is awesome, but these are not returnable even though Prime, so if they don’t work out, they are not really worth being a great deal.  I always recommend Zoya polishes though, they are gorgeous, great brushes for application, and have a good selection.\n",
      "159->A truly honest review. | 2 | 20 | This company gives a free bob wig if you give a 5 star review.  I shop online alot and rely on reviews for help so I'm not going that route.  I'll give a real review instead.<br /> This is not a terrible wig but for the price point I've had much better.  Hair is beautiful but sheds.  All wigs shed, yes, but too much shedding for the price point.  I'm used to kinky straight or italian yaki hair that allows for all styles but this wig does not hold a curl from a hot tool very well.  Great if you want to just wear it in its natural state or have time for no heat options but for me, that's a deal breaker as part of the reason I love this texture is for all the styling options.  The hair is not as thick, root to ends and before I cowshed this unit, I ended up having to cut about 2 inches from it because the ends were so scraggly.  I'm harder on this texture when reviewing as this is my go to texture and I've purchased this texture from no less than 10 vendors over the past few years so my knowledge on what it should be like makes me that way.<br />With that in mind, I would not purchase this item again.  At this price point the quality should be better and the hair more versatile.  On the plus side, the preplucking was decent, though I had to help it out a bit.  Nots are not bleached but are very small in the front so I was able to clear that up fairly easily.  I know people care about the wig smells so I will say it smelled wiggy but not stinky out of the box.  Hair is soft and flows nice as well.  I'd post pics but they'd be misleading as, since I'm so used to this texture, I've hooked this unit up but, for newbies this wig is more work that its worth- again, price point considered.  You can get better quality with less work required elsewhere.  Again, this is an honest review.  Even though the 5 star review tactics turned me off, I can say that it's possible I got a bad unit and this is not the norm but I given I've had cheaper units with the same issues, I think this is just the product.  Anyway, hopefully this was helpful.\n",
      "160->Poor Quality | 2 | 20 | The overall quality is OK for the big brushes. The small ones for eyes are useless, it was too flimsy and did not pickup any product. The small flat top for blending concealer does not blend well, product get stuck on the brush instead on blending it out on skin. Very poorly made.<br />The big ones are OK to use, but not well made like Real Technique. Although it is soft, but it was not straight or uniformly cut if that makes sense, it was crooked and uneven.<br />The handles are loose and about to come off (the section between the gold metal and pink wood).<br />The smell is horrible as soon as I open the bag. Very strong plastic chemical smell.<br />I'd rather buy good quality brushes from Real Technique. They are so dense, soft, blend well, distribute product evenly and has almost nothing left on the brush.<br />Although these are cheap, but without those useless small brushes, you can get Real Technique for about the same price.<br />I do not recommend.\n",
      "164->Heady Sweet Skin Cream | 5 | 20 | When I first tried this Marshmallow Vanishing Crème a few weeks ago in a sampler kit, I purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product. Can I say it is addictive? Yes, I guess it does have a banana scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whip cream. To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it \"vanishing\" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />\"Marsh Mallow\" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel. They add a level of protection to your skin care routine and the clay mask I recently tried cleaned my pores like a dream.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />A Total Burt Bees Fan Until the End of Time\n",
      "165->Retinol Night Cream/Very Therapeutic | 5 | 20 | I am REALLY noticing a difference with this product.  I use it every night, and I have found<br />that gently massaging the Retinol Cream into my face and problem areas on my face,  also helps. The deep congestion that I have been struggling with forever,<br />is clearing.  The other positive aspect of this product is that it does not cause my skin<br />to be drawn and dry.  I am so happy that I finally found this product!!\n",
      "168->Great hair cutter, easy to use. | 4 | 19 | My wife is a professional hair stylist. She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.\n",
      "173->Beautiful colors, and so easy to use! May need a wisp of translucent powder... | 5 | 19 | This LUXAZA 6 PCS Khaki Brown Neutral Eyeshadow Stick Set is so gorgeous! All of the colors are beautiful when applied alone, or used together. They are so easy to use and blend with the brush that is on the opposite end of each stick.<br />The colors are buildable, so you can have a whisper of color or make a bold statement. They also have great staying power, but can be washed away quickly with any cleanser.<br />My eyelids are naturally oily, so I have to add a wisp of translucent powder over top, so they won't stay tacky. They still keep the shimmer, too, which is not overdone. It is just right for my 51 year young self to wear and not look silly, just elegant.<br />I love this eyeshadow stick set! From the colors to the ease of use, it just works well. The colors would look beautiful on anyone's skin tone, and they are great for a busy schedule. It is easy to place them all into a pretty cosmetic jar or even a drawer for quick access.<br />They come nicely packaged and are more than worthy of gifting to any makeup lover. I would absolutely recommend these!\n",
      "174->UPDATE:  RIP 8/14/19 .  SHAVER KAPUT! | 1 | 19 | Worked well until it didn't. Only lasted 6 months<br />Shaver suddenly stopped running yesterday.  Won't charge and won't turn on. Too bad, it worked well until I didn't.<br />I can no longer recommend this shaver.\n",
      "176->So far so good | 4 | 19 | I have only used this to curl and have had some really good success. I typically use a straightener but it would strain my wrist trying to twist it all around. The twisted plates on this really help. I got the technique down pretty easily.<br /><br />I did 4/5 stars because I was hoping this would be quick and easy compared to a curling iron. But the instructions specifically state to go slow (and if you feel like you’re going too slow, go even slower). In that case, it’s not going to be quicker like I hoped.<br /><br />Updated to add the second picture showing day 2 of “curls.” Works well to add some wavy texture the next day.\n",
      "178->Company bribes customers to change reviews to 5 stars! Beware! | 2 | 19 | I love the product,  but the container you add the water to broke on the first use. Then after super-gluing that part back together,  the whole rim where you screw the lid onto the water container snapped in two. All I was doing was unscrewing the cap to add water.  So frustrating!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />Simon at Ovonni contacted me via e-mail to offer me a replacement in exchange for me replacing my bad review with a good one. I responded that I would take the replacement and once I had the chance to check it out and make sure it didn't break after the first couple of uses, I would CHANGE my review. As soon as I received the replacement, I started getting e-mails from Simon asking me to remove all my pictures and to give the product a 5-star rating. I ignored the e-mail at first until he repeatedly e-mailed me telling me to remove the photos and give a 5-star rating, neither of which I agreed to. I wanted to make sure it was not defective before I reviewed again. The replacement does seem to work, but before I could write this review I received 7 e-mails (between 4/18/19-5/9/19) from Simon pestering me about removing my bad review and photos and leaving a 5 star review. The last time he e-mailed he tried to bribe me with $50 and a makeup train case. I angrily responded that if he e-mailed me one more time I would upload screen captures of all his e-mails and bribe attempts to my review. That did the trick and he hasn't e-mailed me since. I understand that negative reviews affect the sellers in a bad way, but I also understand that reviews are there for a reason. Had I seen a review such as my own before I purchased, I would not have ordered this product. Yes, I do have a steamer that now works, but the shady business practices of this company angered me. Now I know why the product has such good reviews! They are bribing and pestering customers to change them! Beware! I will not purchase anything else from this company ever again. My 2 stars are now strictly because of the customer service behavior, not the actual product.\n",
      "180->Seems like quality has changed for the worse. | 2 | 19 | My toddler took a solid two years to get any hair worth brushing; we used this brush and loved it. It brushed her exceptionally fine hair very well and wasn't too rough.<br />We needed a second brush to take with us in our \"car essentials\" bag so I recently ordered it again. Something has changed between my original order and now; the density of the bristles is much thinner now. I'll upload a picture. I much prefer the older brush that I ordered September 12, 2020 (the brush in the right in the picture, labeled old) compared to the more sparse brush I ordered May 16, 2021 (left brush in picture, labeled new). Disappointing!\n",
      "183->Hair Saver! | 4 | 19 | When I went through chemotherapy, I lost most of my hair, and as a woman this was a real blow to my self image. This trio of products was recommended to me by the woman who runs our local health food store, and along with taking an oral biotin supplement (5,000 mcg per day), I used this three-step system (shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in serum) to wash and condition my hair. Between the two approaches, both oral and topical, I re-grew all of my original hair, and now my hairdresser swears that I have more hair now than I did before I was diagnosed with cancer and went through chemotherapy.  It does feel thicker to me now, too, and my husband has also remarked that my hair has never looked better.<br /><br />The only caveat is that if you have longer hair you may need an extra conditioner for the ends. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this product (plus oral biotin supplements) to anyone who has had hair loss due to chemotherapy.  I was very satisfied with the results.  Minus one star only because the conditioner doesn't work quite as well on longer hair, but it is more important that you apply this product to the scalp, so again you can use a more silky conditioner for the ends.\n",

I own a couple of wigs and enjoy wearing them to parties, get together, work and specially near Halloween to change my look.<br /><br />Here's what I like about the wig:<br />1.

      "196->Pretty stretchy and thin but OK for price | 4 | 18 | These spiral ties from Gomayee are very handy. They are inexpensive. Except for the original brand of these, all of the ones I have found on Amazon have the little rough and uneven part where the the circle is completed. Thicker bands definitely have it show less though. The lower the gauge (if this is the same way earring posts are measured) the better the tie.<br /><br />These are extremely thin and stretchy.  I have a couple of photos with blue text that show the difference. The thick one is actually too big for my thinner hair. These are also rather loose on my thin hair. I have some smaller ones with thick plastic that are my favorites. I would think these are good for big buns and maybe for thicker hair? I can twist  them around about 4 times for a pony tail. Still they don’t damage or tangle my hair and I will use them. They feel fine on my wrist too for when I take it out and don’t want to lose it.\n",

      "198->Side by side comparison of three sleep masks-Earth Theraputics is no longer my favorite | 3 | 18 | This is a side-by-side comparison of three masks:<br />[[ASIN:B001ET7HJI Earth Therapeutics Mind/Body Therapy Sleep Mask, Cotton, Silk]]<br />[[ASIN:B00FJQFJX8 Bedtime Bliss® Contoured & Comfortable Sleep Mask & Moldex® Ear Plugs]]<br />[[ASIN:B00M9BC1M8 Premium Quality Eye Mask with Contoured Shape By Nidra]]<br /><br />I've used the Earth Therapeutics soft mask for five years, and the the Nidra and Bedtime Bliss masks for the last several months. All have their advantages and disadvantages. My favorite is now the Nidra mask, but it has an important flaw.<br /><br />I sleep from after midnight until 8am, and my bedroom is bright. Therefore, I need a mask that will stay on for seven or eight hours. If it shifts when I move during the night, it will not be covering my eyes when the sun comes up.<br /><br />Although I used it for several years, the Earth Therapeutics mask does the worst job of staying in place all night. I think this is because it does not have as much shape or structure as the other two masks. Also, it presses on your eyes, making it a bit less comfortable than the other two masks. I no longer use this mask.<br /><br />The Nidra mask does the best job of staying in place. It is also slightly larger than the Bedtime Bliss mask, and feels a bit more comfortable. However, the Nidra has a flaw: Although they all have the same length band, the elastic on the Nidra band has a bit more tension than the Bedtime Bliss or the Earth Therapeutics masks, which means that it is too tight on my fat head. I have actually had to extend the strap with a piece of dual-sided velcro strap in order to make it comfortable. Now it fits the best and stays in place better than the other two masks.<br /><br />The Nidra mask is about 3/4 inch or 2cm wider across the eyes than the Bedtime Bliss mask. If you have a small or narrow face, you may want to try the Bedtime Bliss mask first<br /><br />As far as light blocking and comfort go, both the Nidra and the Bedtime Bliss do a good job. Therefore, my choice is the Nidra because it stays on better after I make the strap longer.<br /><br />Summary: I have stopped using the Earth Therapeutics mask. The Bedtime Bliss and Nidra are very similar, but the Nidra fits me better and stays in place longer. If you have a large head like me, the Nidra mask will be tight. If you have a small or narrow face, try Bedtime Bliss.\n",
      "199->Not worth the current price | 3 | 18 | I've used a number of Jack Black products over the years, but this was my first experience with the MP 10 Epic Moisture oil. I have a short (7mm) beard as well as a short haircut, and tried using the oil on both as directed. Overall I didn't find it to be bad but also didn't feel that it lived up to its price.<br /><br />There are three things I liked about this oil. The packaging and bottling was very good. It comes in a well-made glass bottle with a good pump. I found the instructions to be detailed and precise. I also liked the fact that the scent was almost nonexistent. Some reviewers say it has a faint lemon/citrus smell. It reminded me more of a glass of water with some lemon wedges in it. Overall, pleasant.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the texture of the oil. It was rather thin compared to other beard/hair oils I've used and seemed like it required about twice as much product. While it didn't leave a greasy feeling on my hands, or in my beard or hair, it also didn't provide much in the way of moisturizing/softening. Again, it was fine, but not \"$35 per bottle fine.\"<br /><br />I've used two other beard oils on Amazon which I felt were a particularly good value: Gibs, and The Art of Shaving. Both have stronger and more nuanced scent profiles, but both are thicker and have much better moisturizing properties. I'll continue to stick with those.\n",
      "202->Will not work with Optical Signals from Some TV brands | 2 | 18 | The original TVlink I did not have a optical input, so they added a crippled one to the Tvlink II.  The issue is that virtually all modern TV sets output audio thru a optical connector and are set to Dolby Digital 5.1 by default.  The Tvlink II will not respond to a optical signal with Dolby Digital.  Why??  The Resound Reunite works fine with a Dolby Digital optical signal.<br /><br />So, if your TV allows it, you can go into setup and muck around to change the audio decoding to PCM in order to make the TV link II work.  Unfortunately, many Panasonic and LG TV sets will not allow you to change to force PCM output, so you need to buy a separate decoder.  A high quality decoder is expensive, the cheap ones delay the signal.<br /><br />So, my Tvlink II works with my Samsung TV once I changed the audio format, but not my Panasonic.\n",

      "216->Perfect for Quick Drama | 5 | 17 | These lashes are VERY dramatic. I saw a few negative reviews stating that they were too much but the description and photos give accurate measurements so it was no surprise to me. They’re pretty easy to put on and they came packaged perfectly. SO<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to apply<br />Easy to remove<br />Drama without much hassle<br /><br />Cons<br />Heavy<br />Don’t fit my eyelid quite right and are difficult to trim off excess<br /><br />TIPS<br />Apply your regular eyeliner first. If you use this eyeliner, it runs a bit and your lashes may not stick where they should. Do your regular liner design and then shake up the magnetic eyeliner and apply it where the lashes need to go. Apply, let dry, then apply again before putting the lashes on. Do NOT remove them to show anyone how easy it is, they pull the liner right off and won’t go back on (yes I did this lmao)<br /><br />So, 5 star rating from me regardless of the cons. They’re so fluffy and soft, and I expected magnets on my eyelids to be just a little heavy\n",
      "227->It works | 3 | 17 | Here's the explanation for the 3-star rating:<br />- It really does work<br />- Smells great<br />- Extremely hard to apply. It comes off in chunks.<br />- Way overpriced<br />Even though this product does work & smells great, I will not be buying it again.  It's a shame because I was super excited & wanted to love it.\n",
      "229->Not bad for a cheaper face and cellulite messager | 4 | 17 | I didn't think the unit was working, it has vague instructions, but just touch it to dry bare skin and you'll feel it. I did not come wit a AC plug, (minus one star for that), you'll have to use one from another gadget, I used my tablet one. When it is charged, press and hold the button in until it beeps and lights up. There are two levels of power, I think, press the button one more time, the indicator light on the power button is orange, press it one more time and you'll see red. It runs for 3 minutes and then shuts off. You can use it a total of 30 minutes in one day. Diagrams in the booklet show you which way to use it effectively. This is important- you need to use a hydro gel or a oil, like rose hip oil or such like I do or you will feel a slight electric shock against your skin.<br />Have I seen improvements? YES. I had a NUface facial and this gadget seems to being doing as well as the NUface mini. I use it every day and I notice tighter skin, less redness, and less wrinkles. I use it just 3 minutes every morning. For the price I think it is a nice portable massage. I use it also with my cellulite cream on my legs and without changing anything else, the cellulite is fading (been only a week).\n",
      "230->Won't curl, why not? | 2 | 17 | Honest Review:<br /><br />First time purchasing from this buyer.  I received my item on time.  This unit is not 180% density, its more 130%-140%, I would have been shocked if it was 180% at this price point.  I do not believe this unit is 100% human hair because it will not hold a curl...it has NOTHING to do with the hot temps the east coast is experiencing, because I curled the hair in my home at 400 degrees and it simply will not hold a freakin' curl.<br /><br />It forms a curl; however, within minutes the curls were gone, I could not even get out the house before the darn curls were gone.  I say it has some human hair because I can smell human hair while curling.  I tried curling the hair closer to the root; however, it would not even bend let alone curl.  The curls I was able to form were closer to the end, and those curls were GONE in no time.  Two Stars because the hair is soft, arrived on time and 20\" as stated.<br /><br />I will not purchase again from this seller, because I am not confident I will receive what I paid for.\n",
      "234->Thumbs down👎 | 2 | 17 | I really like this product.  It keeps my curls defined without looking wet or crunchy.  You need very little product.  At first I used about the size of a quarter for my short hair & it weighed my curls down.  I have learned a dime size is perfect for me.  The difference I have found with this product compared to similar ones is even when I'm out in the wind my curls remain looking soft & not frizz.<br />Update, I've noticed that my hair gets much more frizzy while I sleep & my natural curls are flat & frizzy.  I only wash my hair twice a week normally.  With this product I have to wash my hair everyday to renew my curls. Other products let me just spritz with a little water & the style is as good as new.  The smell also gets a sour odor after it's on my hair.\n",
      "235->Results In 1 Week - See Before & After Pics | 5 | 17 | [[VIDEOID:f2b369e0d51ead5b1e259f05074a0f65]] I was actually shocked when I looked at the pictures I took of my face of &quot;before&quot; and 7 days &quot;after&quot; using this miracle massage tool. I have been using this tool once per day at night for 7 days (I missed 1 day out of the 7 days) in combination with my normal nightly face routine. Prior to using the face tool, I apply a liberal amount of my eye cream so that there is still some that is not completely rubbed into my skin (the instructions recommend using an eye gel or similar product). I then use the wider, blunted tip on the tool and slowly move the tip around my face and pause in each area for about 5-10 seconds per the instruction manual.<br /><br />The tool itself is about 6.5&quot; long and feels like a wide marker when held in your hand. It is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included) and has a power button with 2 intensity levels. When turned on, the tool emits bionic waves via the tool's tip when it makes contact with your skin (see demonstration in video). The lower wave intensity is supposed to be used for slight to moderate wrinkle reduction and the higher intensity is meant for deeper wrinkles. However, during my testing, I used the higher intensity level exclusively (all of my wrinkles looked deep to me lol). The instructions state that the tool can be used up to twice per day (with at least 6hrs between each treatment time) and should be used on clean skin. Treatments do not cause any pain/discomfort and do not leave any marks or redness on your face.<br /><br />This wrinkle eraser is incredibly easy to use, though does take some time dedication if you follow the recommended 5-10sec per skin surface area. I have already begun to see results (thanks to remembering to take &quot;before&quot; pictures) and will 110% continue to use this tool indefinitely. Now that I know the tool works, I'm going to start using the smaller tip on the wrinkles just under my lash lines in addition to using the broader tip around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing more results, and I would highly recommend this product to others.<br /><br />*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

      "239->Corporate Greed Ruins Good Shaver... | 2 | 16 | The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life. Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself.<br /><br />The way it does this is that it turns on the \"change blade\" warning LED. And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day. Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades.<br /><br />Way to go Norelco. I used to be a big fan.\n",
      "241->Fun and works great! | 5 | 16 | I love this set! Even though I don’t need 6 of them.<br />They are well made, very stretchy, so I guess they fit a wide range of head sizes!<br />Super super soft. The fabric is thick.<br />Comfortable to use, it does not squeeze the head. But it holds all the hair back.<br />I use it when washing my face. It keeps my hair dry too.<br />I love the bow! Very 50’s!!!<br />Great colors. Like it a lot.\n",
      "244->Nice starter set | 5 | 16 | Stones were smaller than expected, but I can still work with them. I might have to find a larger sacral/belly stone to replace this one. Other than that, these were all very nice. Just the right amount of smoothness and grip. nicely organized and matched sizes. I like the way they were all labeled upon receipt. I especially liked the bonus stones.<br />*edit- this is a wonderful company! I will definitely buy some specialty stones from them in the near future. They read my review, and offered to replace my sacral stone! Can't get better customer service than that!!\n",

      "248->Norelco replaced my old Braun | 5 | 16 | I just got my first Norelco model 8825 XL, after 7 years using a Braun 4501. I considered these two brands the top in the electrical shaving industry. In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?<br />Let first look at the Norelco series:<br />The different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic &quot;Lift &amp; Cut&quot; system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's &quot;Lift and Cut&quot; system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.<br />The performances, Norelco vs. Braun:<br />I have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.<br />The features I like:<br />I am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far. The long hair trimmer is great, but that is almost standard in most models, but not the Advantage's Series. Plug and play is great, since I don't travel every day. Cleaning is simple; just rinse it in the sink. I like the solid construction the Norelco's design is, the rotating machine is fun to use and is very smooth.\n",
      "249->Ovation | 3 | 16 | I have been using this product for several weeks, but have not seen a difference for this reason, I am rating the product a 3 star.<br />It is an expensive product to not see a change in my hair.\n",
      "253->I didn't expect to like these | 5 | 16 | Let's start out by explaining that I have longer (waist length), fine hair, but a lot of it.  Nothing stays in my hair.  It tangles like a beast.  I've pretty much been living with my hair in a braid for the last year because it is the only thing I can do that doesn't end up in a huge mess but also mostly stays-well, except for all the frizzies and flyaways that sneak out.  So I was looking for another fast alternative to get my hair back and out of my face that also wouldn't require an hour of brushing to undo.<br />These were cheap, and Amazon is always so great about returns, that I decided to give it ago.  I figured, at worse, at least it would be a simple-ish way to pull my hair back when I am working at the computer.  And they are.  20 seconds and my hair is back in a bun without the discomfort of lots of other hair styles.  I mean, they are actually surprisingly comfortable.<br />But what I did not expect is for them to hold so well!  I put my hair in a high bun yesterday then went for a run.  I had fully intended to take the bun out and put my hair in a braid, because there was no way this thing would hold through a run, but IT DID!  7 miles later, my bun was still secure and tight, but comfortable and looked as good (which honestly wasn't that good to begin with) as it did when I first put it up.  I could not believe it held through the entire run.<br />In all honesty, they are a bit fussy to use, and I have not perfected making it look like a perfect doughnut bun.  But I'm not looking for winning style awards.  I just wanted a simple way to get my hair up and back that would hold for a few hours. And in that aspect I got way more than I bargained for.<br />Very impressed, very pleased, very glad I took a chance!\n",
      "254->great item, totally worth the price, no smell | 5 | 16 | After reading some of the reviews on this item, I was wary of buying this item, but I'm glad I took a chance because the item really does live up to its promise to help organize your purse. The item is made of durable, quality material, and I can see it holding up for years to come. The price compared to other purse organizers is much more economical and I like that it has a bottom-it makes switching purses much faster than if I had to fish out the organizer and then move my loose items.<br /><br />A concern listed in a couple of the other reviews is that the organizers smell-I did not encounter that at all, and I'm very sensitive to smells. The smaller organizer fits into my standard size purses and really does help keep me organized. I wish some of the pockets were of a different size, but overall the organizer fits my needs and I'm very, very glad I took a chance on this item.<br /><br />I bought it through Amazon instead of the TV offer so I didn't have to worry about sneaky S&H charges etc, and as a minimalist, I only need one set, not two, and I certainly didn't need their \"special bonus gift\".\n",
      "260->Love Sonicare Toothbrushes!! | 4 | 16 | I recently purchased this Sonicare toothbrush as the previous Sonicare toothbrush I had for 4 years died on me.<br /><br />I enjoy this Sonicare Toothbrush a lot better than the last one I owned for several reasons:<br /><br />1) The shape of this toothbrush head is oval and tapered at each end for better cleaning of my teeth. Plus the bristles aren't flat, but tapered which seems to give a better clean. (Verses the rectangular shape of the previous toothbrush head on last Sonicare toothbrush).<br /><br />2)The neck of this toothbrush is angled forward, which makes it easier to position the toothbrush for optimal cleaning.<br /><br />3) I also wear braces and really feel that the shape of this toothbrush head cleans thoroughly between the brackets and wire. Even if I didn't wear braces, I feel this toothbrush gives a cleaning. So recommend this toothbrush for people who don't wear braces as well.<br /><br />4) Strong brushing action of toothbrush head is great too for cleaning teeth.<br /><br />5) No need to have a toothbrush charger! Instead all you need to do is replace two AA batteries (battery life approximately 6 weeks) and you are ready to go!<br /><br />Besides, who really wants to wait several hours for their toothbrush to be fully charged once the toothbrush loses it power. Also no need to carry a charger with you when you travel.<br /><br />6) Great price for $39.99!\n",
      "261->Expensive Machines | 5 | 15 | The NuDerma wand has done a lot for my aging skin. There are a few creams and sera I swear by -> modern science is pretty cool. It used to be that anything topical just sat on your skin doing nothing (except the one with the french name and gazillion dollar price tag - which, btw, you can get much cheaper in the blue german tin plus seaweed serum). Anyhoo - enter the era of home treatments. Thermal machines are great if you have the money, and for less (but still not cheap) you can get these wands that are practically miraculous.<br /><br />Used correctly and alongside good skincare practices, they can clear acne, minimize lines, and restore an awful lot of tone and some volume to aging skin. They don't work for everyone, but my skin is thin from prednisone use and it's aging, and the NuDerma wand has been great at firming and plumping over time.<br /><br />Mine came with the red wands, and I wanted to try the blue on my kid's pizza face. Did I mention that these things zap you?<br /><br />Yeah, that's important. They zap you. You want to get some numbing cream. Anyway, he's never going to let me do this again, but it's too bad because it cleared his skin beautifully. And fast. And no giant pores from popping stuff. And because they are combination wands, I can use them on my skin.<br /><br />All for a very affordable amount.\n",

I'm bummed about it.\n",
      "264->Safe but Not Terribly Effective / Smells Like Castor Oil | 3 | 15 | If you like the smell of castor oil, then this will be right up your alley. I personally do not like the smell (my husband says it reminds him of spit-up!) so this shampoo was a little tough for me to use. But I bought it because it is safe/non-toxic (according to EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database) and supposedly treats dry scalp/dandruff.  Well, I used almost half the bottle and saw no results with my scalp issues. I know there are different causes so it may work for someone else's dry scalp, but didn't work for me.<br /><br />PROS: safe/non-toxic, gentle, cleans well<br />CONS: castor oil scent, ineffective at tackling dry scalp/dandruff\n",
      "266->The Real \"Miracle In A Jar\" For Me! | 5 | 15 | I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br /><br />I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new \"Simply Radiant\" skin care system with fancy \"Soy Proteins\" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br /><br />I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch \"shine\" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.<br /><br />I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!\n",
      "267->Empty bottles for massage oils or lotion: WORK GREAT | 5 | 15 | It's a simple product, just an empty bottle with a pump on top that fits massage belts. But this is very well-made and I appreciate the quality and value.<br /><br />The listing says it's \"...designed specifically to work with creams and lotions,\" but FYI, I am finding that it is great for massage oil as well. It hasn't leaked and has a good seal. Perfect amount of tension/resistance when pushing down the pump, in my opinion. I'd recommend this product by made by Body Linen. Packaged well, protected from damage effectively. Arrived so clean and new-looking (they are new), in plastic bag. I almost felt like it was silly that I cleaned the two bottles I bought before use (a habit) because these things looked sterilized and perfect already.<br /><br />Nothing to complain about, and happy to find this item and have it work so flawlessly.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001CE31XQ Massage Bottle - White 8 oz with pump]]\n",
      "269->Not Authentic | 1 | 15 | This Niacinamide + Zinc The Ordinary product from Amazon is NOT authentic.<br /><br />Please do NOT buy this!<br /><br />I was doubtful when I read the reviews on this, but they were all right. This in fact is not a genuine product. I decided to purchase the same product from Sephora and the differences are drastic. First, there is no gap on the fake of the bottle located below the cap. The ridges are larger compared to the authentic one.<br /><br />Secondly, the code on the bottle of the fake one is missing. There should ALWAYS be a code on the bottle, not the paper. When I tried the fake one, the serum itself left a weird sheen as if I left glue and eggwhites on my face. It smelled like glue and was not pleasant. The real one is a much thinner formula and had no odor at all. It left my face looking 10x better than the fake one.<br /><br />I guess you could say the one from Amazon was an imposter.

I wish it smelled like banana or chocolate or something but flowers?  Yeesh.  It is a nice darkening formula and even after one use, I noticed a difference.  Goes on smooth and absorbs evenly.  The scent is so strong for me however that my sinus's immediately flared up and got stuffy and after trying to wash it off my hands and chest area, I couldn't get it off.<br /><br />Got it for $9 at Walmart.  Don't waste your time paying inflated high prices.\n",

I ordered headbands from another vendor to wear.<br /><br />*update*<br /><br />Wig lasts all of two to three days. I’ve been working with it using fabric softer and water in a spray bottle but it’s awful. I did the book method and it untangled pretty good but it lasted one day. Has tangled and matted pretty bad.

Matter of fact I think I want my money back, this is bait and switch. This O'Hair Steamer...is not what shows in the description or picture<br /><br />I'll first start off by saying I was concerned from the negative reviews about the product not working after a few uses. I have a little over a week and a half now and I have used it for both my hair and face. Treat it delicate and kind!!!!<br /><br />The thing is very sensitive.place on a secure surface. I noticed the cord and wiring shuts it off its unbalanced and what not....but it worked later on when I did my face so idk I need to keep it on a flat surface and NOT move it while its on. Treat it like a baby, clean after each use and hope for the best.<br /><br />Face - really great steam rotate your face around or center yourself in the middle for a neutral stream I love it I use it 3 times a week.<br /><br />Hair - this is where I notice it shut off,  If my head bumped it or moved just gotta find the perfect spot if your head is too far up I think it shuts off..the steam also rotates so if you don't feel it at one spot its working its way around it seems.<br /><br />All in all I rate the hair apparatus a 7/10 and the face 9/10....for an average of say 8, 8.5. If this thing last me at least one year...I will feel like I got my monies worth....I do see and feel results. Nonetheless I am gonna contact the seller to see why the bait and switch!\n",
      "289->I'm Happy | 4 | 14 | I'm giving this a 4 only because you will still need to floss if you want to really take care of your teeth.  As far as brushing goes, it does a 5-star job and it has already (after 2 months) improved my gums.<br /><br />Someone said it felt too unsubstantial after having had a Sonicare.  I, for one, am happy to have a lighter toothbrush do a better job than the heavy one (I admit, I had a really OLD Sonicare--the charger must have been over 10 years old at the least, maybe 15, and I was on my second handle--they could be different now).<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this highly.  Hope it lives as long as the Sonicare brushes lived.\n",

What I had written before turned out to be such a complicated and long commentary, that I decided to simplify the review to a simple paragraph.<br /><br />At first, I had a problem with the product, but then found it was my error.  When bathing, I had washed my hair twice, and later noticed I got some scalp itching.  Then I found out that you're not supposed to wash your hair twice with ANY shampoo, as it will strip the oils out, and make your head itch.  So, three days later, I used it again, but only once.  That was just fine.  The problem did not repeat.  I've since tried the Unscented version of this product, and like it too.\n",

I’m a product/makeup girl, so needless to say this will be very hard for me.<br />This bag is huge for a TSA 311 bag- so much so that I asked in the questions section if anyone has had troubles through TSA with it. I decided to see how many items I could fit in it (all sample/travel/trial items). Grand total 44 items, including the 15ml & 30ml bottles from the Doubtless Bay 3pcs airless pump dispenser set and the whole Juvitus cobalt blue 7pc glass bottle started kit (excluding bag).<br />I did- just for kicks- try to fit all these items in a standard quart-sized kitchen zip bag and was only able to get about 80% of what I fit in this bag in.<br />So durability remains to be seen. I will try to update after a couple of my summer trips.<br /><br />Update Jan 2019- the bag is durable nonstretch  plastic, however the zipper is super cheap. So the bag is useless once the zipper goes-which it did. I used it 3 times. The zipper came off the track and separated from the plastic on the bag which from the reviews seems to happen a lot. So you may only get a few uses out of this bag.\n",
      "303->Did not shave close for me | 3 | 14 | This unit is well designed, quiet; feels good in the hand and super-easy to clean. The shave was comfortable and did not irritate my face. The price is quite reasonable. Unfortunately it didn't shave close enough for me. If I made many passes I could get a close shave but would find that by 4pm I would need to shave again(not that my beard is so heavy). Like all electrics I've used it does a sub-par job under the chin and on the neck. I've decided to send it back and go back to my Braun. Right now I've used the Norelco and then finished with the Braun, which even with year-old blades is much closer and just as fast.<br /><br />This is electric shaver number five for me (4 bought thru Amazon). I started ~15 years ago with a norelco 5xxx series, and was satified for a few years. Despite changing the blades (perhaps my beard got tougher)I became dissatisfied with the shave. I switched to a Braun 5000 series which was noticably closer with the exception of the neck which required many passes to shave adequately.<br /><br />The Braun lost it's edge after about a year or two, and I decided to try one of the Panasonic ultra-high speed, wet-dry units (10,000)strokes/min. I got a good deal on a close-out  unit. I liked the build and the wet-dry feature, and the ease of cleaning, but I found that this shaver irritated my skin. I went back to the braun, and later upgraded to a Braun 7526, which I bought refurbished without the cleaning unit. It does a superior job and next time I upgrade I may buy the unit with the cleaner. It needs new blades yearly for best results, and it too doesn't do a great job with on my neck; but everything else is excellent.\n",
      "306->It's okay but not what I was expecting | 3 | 14 | This is a tricky review to write.  When I received the product, my initial reaction was, &#34;What is this?&#34;  The photo on this item's page is very misleading.  The product is not a dark creamy brown looking thing.  It's basically pale brown colored sugar crystals.  That's it.  I contacted the seller with a photos (see photos) and said there seems to be something missing.  They assured me &#34;As for the packaging, thanks for letting me know, we will have it modified accordingly this week.&#34;  I'm not sure what that means, but besides the photo being completely different, the description indicates it's 8.8 oz and it's an organic brown sugar.  The ingredients don't indicate &#34;organic&#34; at all and the label on the jar states it's 7 oz.  So it's not the product I thought I was purchasing.  I'm bothered that the photo was SO different than the product I received.  I honestly thought the cream or oil must have evaporated or something.<br /><br />That said, my testing of the product has been odd and I'm torn about an accurate star rating.  The first day, I wet my arm and took a scoop of the crystals and rubbed them over my arm.  All of the crystals fell off into the sink within seconds and other than being wet, my arm was exactly the same.  I was thinking that even one star was too generous for a useless product.  Today, I gave it another try.  I scooped the crystals up with my fingers instead of the plastic scoop.  I did my best to keep them on my arm this time.  My arm turned pretty pink during this process and I really didn't know what to expect.  I was only able to do this for about 40 seconds before I lost the last of the crystals.  I rinsed my arm and was impressed by how soft my arm felt.  However, I know you can take salt and product a similar softness by using some oil along with it.  So I don't know....it softens the skin but at the rate it's been disappearing on me, the product won't last long and there's really nothing extraordinary about it.<br /><br />Note: I was able to purchase this item, at a discount, for my honest review.\n",
      "312->Good idea but doesn’t work well. | 1 | 14 | I tried to do electrolysis on my chin.<br />I’m pretty handy with DIY cosmetic procedures. Well, this didn’t work out very well. It’s very hard to do this on yourself because you have to insert the probe into the hair follicle.<br />I tried, and “buzzed” the hair several times. Nothing happened.<br />Next day I had a small raised welt on my chin. 2 days later the welt is still there.<br />I do not recommend this machine to do electrolysis on your own face.<br />I will have to go back to my professional electrologist.\n",
      "316->Not even close! | 2 | 14 | Having read the glowing reviews from others I was anxious to receive this shaver.  When it finally arrived I made sure to charge it up (takes a long time initially 6-8 hrs.) then finally tried it on a 2 day stubble.  Well, I wasn't impressed with the shave, it was irritating, uncomfortable, and the gel dispensing gadget was awkward to use.  I decided to give this unit the benefit of the doubt because it does state to give it at least 3 weeks for your skin to grow accustom to shaving by this method.<br /><br />Well, here I am 3 weeks later and I'm still not impressed with the shave.  I particularly get skin iritation along my neck (burns quite a bit) and it's hard to taper shave near side burns. I've also tried different methods of shaving from: in the shower, over the sink, pre-wash and lubricate with skin lubrication lotion, and just flat out dry shave (very uncomfortable!).  Another minus is the charge does not last very long, the shaver peters out after about 2 shaves of about 5-8 minutes (maybe I have a faulty battery?..) I end up having to charge it often.<br /><br />I now decided to go back to using a Braun shaver, which I should have purchased in the first place!  My previous one was very good, but i decided to give Norleco a chance...oh well, I guess I'll just have to give it to my nephew - he thinks it looks cool, and he just started shaving!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Ummm...it looks cool<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Terrible shave<br /><br />-weak charge<br /><br />-lift and cut system is not effective<br /><br />-very irritating along neck area<br /><br />-takes long to fully charge<br /><br />-lubricating feature very awkward to use and can get expensive<br /><br />-cleaning is tedious<br /><br />In my opinion go with a foil system instead like a Braun, Panasonic, or even Remington.  This system is much more effective and although primarily expensive, it will more than make up for the price in a closer shave and not having to buy lubricating lotion, shaving cream and razor blades.\n",
      "317->It replaces my favorite German made comb at a fraction of the price. | 5 | 13 | For years I've used the German made Hercules Sagemann model 1623-434.  It's a great comb made of hard rubber.  But they're hard to find in America.  And they're expensive (about $14.00 each).<br /><br />The Cleopatra model 450 is also made of hard rubber.  And the size, feel, and flexibility is almost identical to the Hercules Sagemann.  Yet the Cleopatra costs less than a dollar per comb!<br /><br />For such a low price, I assumed the Cleopatra was probably made in China.  Nope.  I called the manufacturer (Krest Products Corp, Leominster, MA), and they confirmed that it was made in the USA.  Needless to say, I won't be buying the expensive Hercules Sagemann anymore.\n",
      "318->It's Ok. | 3 | 13 | If you ever read my blog you hear me say this constantly... &#34;there are products I like then there are products I love&#34;. Right? Seriously, right now sitting on your vanity are products you love and there are products you do not know what to do with. Those products that simply didn't work  as you imagined, you didn't like the color pay off, didn't last, where expensive but you didn't like so what do you do with them? Right?<br /><br /> Well here is a product I like.<br /><br /> Miracalis Anti-Aging Moisturizer Cream. It is a gentle moisturizer made for all skin types. It has a combination of Vitamin E and Co-Enzyme Q10. Two antioxidants that aid in the protection of the skin as well as its repair. Both needed elements for aging skin. Find it on Amazon HERE.<br /><br /> While those key ingredients are found in this product I find the to be simple, good, ok. In fact when I received it I has impressed that even the packaging was simple. No fancy logos, lettering, packaging, or anything. Just a simple small plastic jar, clean simple font, and nothing else. That kind of surprised me. In the world of mass marketing there was no gimmick on this one. So I gave it a chance and thought to myself.. well I hope the budget was better on what's inside the jar. Unfortunately I didn't feel that either.<br /><br /> You see for me it felt simple. No dramatic experience, no real results, or transformable skin I can measure. It was simply a good moisturizer. No different then anything you can get at a Dollar Store. But then again that is what it felt like. The packaging, the product, and the marketing... just felt simple and unimpressive.<br /><br />While I know everyone has different skin and what may work for me may not work for you... I just believe that within this price point there are greater options. Try Adovia or InstaNatural skin care instead for results driven performance.<br /><br />I will continue to search for proven results driven products that are blue caller budget friendly, that have great ingredients, hopefully US Proud Made, and that I believe will give you true results.\n",

      "323->Adds hydration and tames flyaways. | 5 | 13 | This Argan Oil hair serum is amazing.  It helps calm my frizzies and provides the hydration my straw-like hair is craving this time of year.  It comes in a 1.69 fl oz bottle with a pump dispenser.  This hair serum smells like lilacs to me.  It is a very lovely scent.  It has a medium consistency to it, not to thick but also not runny.  I have long, fine hair so I start with one pump on my fingers, rub it all over my palms, and apply it to my parched ends.  When there is hardly any left on my hands I smooth the top of my head to tame flyaways.  This serum also gives my hair shine which is another great benefit.  I love this product and I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out.  I think that will be a long time though because I can easily see this bottle lasting me at least a year.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

      "328->Not quite my grandfather's shaving brush | 3 | 13 | My maternal grandfather passed away some 40 years ago. After my mother returned from her out-of-state trip to be with her mother and bury her father, she gave me a small box containing some of his personal belongings. Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush. I had no use for it at the time. As I unpacked after a recent move I rediscovered this item and decided to use it. It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad's brush should be properly retired and I should get my own. Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready's, I looked here at Amazon. This was the brush I decided upon. It's ok.<br /><br />It is definitely NOT my grandfather's brush - quality-wise. Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer. So he would not have paid a lot for his. So I thought this one might be similar in quality. I was wrong. It's very stiff. It does not do a great job with the soap lather. It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles. This is probably what badgers smell like. But as I am a native of southern California and we don't need no stinkin' badgers here, I am not positive. This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use. Just prior to the musky animal aroma disappearing, I was frustrated enough with the smell on me all day to look for another brush. Since my grandfather's brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free. But was it a matter of quality or simply a matter of time?<br /><br />I purchased a $70 Vulfix brush, hand-made on the Isle of Man in the UK.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It is much more like granddad's in color, feel, and use. It lathers very nicely. It's very soft on the face. It holds a lot of water. There was a slight smell (nothing at all like the SimplyBeautiful smell)that was gone after the 2nd use. If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one that will last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the \"badgery\" smell - although it did eventually go away. I haven't made the decision to also go with the straight razor. I figure I will give the EMTs in the area a break and stick with the safety razor.....\n",
      "338->Clip Doesn't Leave Any Room for Hair! Can't Stay In. | 1 | 13 | The reason this clip won't stay in anyone's hair isn't that it's too heavy. It's in the way it's constructed. They made it so that when you open the jaws, there's just not much room for hair in there. The metal from the decorative part comes down into the center of the circle made by the open jaws. There just isn't much room for hair.<br /><br />So don't think, like I did, that if you have thick hair, you can wear this clip. You hair won't fit in it. :(<br /><br />If this review was helpful to you, would you click &#34;yes&#34; below? I'm dreaming of becoming a Vine reviewer someday.\n",
      "342->Great E-file. Bad decal (\"Nail Drill\") (update, they may have changed that) | 4 | 13 | Pros: this is fairly lightweight, very quiet, low vibration, battery charges quickly and lasts very long. Overall, I think it is a really good value for a more expensive e-file, while still being more affordable than the $400 options.<br />Cons: one of the biggest cons for me is a personal pet peeve. It's that damn Giant nail drill written on it. ** If the product pictures are accurate, this seems to have been changed** It takes a tool that looks otherwise very professional and sleek and makes it look cheap and amateurish. (I painted over the writing and black and then matte top coated. I'll probably put a sticker on it anyway.) People in a professional setting, please stop referring to this as a drill! It just bolsters peoples fear of efiles, in addition to being completely inaccurate. The other con is that you have to turn the speed dial to turn off the file. A separate power button would be better, so that you could keep your RPM setting as is. This is especially cumbersome and time-consuming when you are switching directions. Turn the dial down to turn off the machine, hit the direction button turn the dial back up to whatever speed you need. May not seem like a big deal, but when you're doing it over and over on lots of clients, it's just a pain in the neck.<br />Overall, I think it's actually pretty high quality piece of equipment, but In fairness, I have never used some of the more expensive professional units from Kupa or youngnails, etc.\n",
      "343->My hairdresser recommended these and I love them! | 5 | 13 | My hairdresser recommended my husband get and use one of these for his thinning hair to use to stimulate the scalp when washing his hair. He also uses it with a rose water spray daily and within six months we have noticed a huge change in the thickness of his hair. I use mine too when I shampoo although I already have incredibly thick hair, and I too have noticed a difference. It also gives a nice lift at the roots too for any ladies with flat hair ( that is why my hairdresser uses them on herself).<br /><br />Great little pack of two. Almost like a his n' hers. Easy to use due to the grip and easy to pull apart and clean. Had ours a while now and still like new. Really great product and super price considering other places on the internet are selling these exact ones at $40 a piece! Pick up a bargain from Amazon.\n",
      "346->Umm. Look elsewhere | 2 | 13 | I was hesitant to buy this headband wig because it didn’t have any other reviews. Furthermore, I’m new to the wig game but I’m going to try and make this review as helpful as possible. Also, I bought this wig with my own coins and all thoughts/opinions are my own.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• it arrived quickly<br />• came with a wig cap<br /><br />Cons<br />•arrived tangled and knotted in places<br />• is not true to length (side by side comparison with a 22 in headband wig)<br />• the wig is tight!!!  Does not seem to be made for anything above a small egg head.<br />• shed a ridiculous amount<br />• did not come with random headband as described.<br />• not as full as pictures show it to be and feels/looks sparse when worn.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend. I wanted to love this wig but it’s just not a slay.\n",
      "348->Cute, simple device | 3 | 13 | Fun little toy.  It...um...vibrates?  In a light, tickly way?  Does it do anything else?  Well, the tip is very smooth so it glides across your skin easily, especially if you've applied any products to your skin (I've used it with a couple of different face/eye creams that I bought separately).  Really, I have no idea if any of the claims it makes are valid, but it isn't unpleasant to use (quite the opposite) and in my I-hate-aging-but-think-I'm-stuck-with-it resignation do get a kick out of fantasizing this little tool will make a difference ;)  I don't regret the purchase--if nothing else it gives me incentive to keep trying and be more diligent with my skin care.  And who knows?  Maybe in a few weeks I'll be pleasantly surprised with some grand, noticeable difference!  I'll be sure to update if I do :D<br /><br />Oh, and product arrived quickly and in brand new condition, so that gets an A+.  However, it was only the wand--NO FREE SAMPLE OIL CAME WITH IT.  (The company really needs to address that misleading invalid promo here on Amazon!)  Good thing I already had some eye cream at home to try it with!\n",
      "352->No instructions were provided in English & no indication of ingredients | 1 | 13 | Without instructions or an indication of ingredients, I am frightened to use this product on my face... does it burn? How long should I leave it on for? Is it just soap and water to wash it off. I am not doubting the efficacy of the product but it is not high quality if there are no instructions.<br /><br />*** Update ***<br />I have used this product twice so far & I am not noticing anything. That said,  I don't have acne or other major skin issues. I bought this product to see if it would help with mild greasy pores, which I assume is quite normal. No noticeable change.<br /><br />For me It did irritate the skin where the skin is most sensitive or thin. Specifically, I felt burning & had small patches of redness in and around my nose. If you buy this product I recommend keeping it away from areas of thin skin like nose, eyelids, etc.<br /><br />From a value for money perspective, this product is meh! Doesn't help beyond soap and water. My kids do get a kick out of the green face...so maybe it is a better entertainment product than a beauty product!\n",
      "354->Liked it but not as full as the picture | 3 | 13 | Liked it but not as full as the picture. I'm returning it because it didn't fit properly.<br />I have a very full head of hair and was hard to fit it all in the cap which make it so<br />it wouldn't fit the way it should. Product delivered as stated.\n",
      "355->Great little bag, great price! | 5 | 13 | I think anyone who follows me or knows me understands my needs for bags. I love them all. Big small, cosmetic, totes, ect. I seem always need one for something but this one is for my makeup for a change.<br />I have used my others for projects or other crafting items so I needed this. (no really I did (wink)) I think it's darling in looks. The pink color and black polka dots are a great combination. I think these would make a fabulous gift too!<br /><br />The bag is very well crafted in that there are no holes or ripped seams. All the pockets are sewn well into place and they hold my little set of brushes like a dream. I love the little mirror that is secured to the inside too.<br />The bottom is also well made and the zippers all glide with ease. The price of this little bag is more than worth it. It fits great under my counter and holds my daily cosmetics perfectly! I am super happy!<br /><br />Overall, great price, well crafted, holds my daily brush and make up, and it fits under my counter.<br />I have nothing negative to add at this time.\n",
      "367->Loved it! | 5 | 12 | This is a really nice spa-like experience for me!<br /><br />I had a similar one but it has only the rough, scrubber side, unlike this one which has both a scrubber side that will scrub off dead skin, as well as a SOFT side that you can polish your skin with after scrubbing. It feels really nice to flip over to the soft, gentle washcloth-like side after using the loofah side on my back.<br />The handles are long and easy to grab onto comfortably, without having to strain and try and twist your body just to clean and get rid of dead skin.<br />I think the soft side makes this much less likely to harden up and become difficult and uncomfortable to use. After several uses, I find it pliable and maneuverable.<br />In my photos, I've added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.<br />I used some body wash on the soft side to help clean and polish my skin, and have to say it feels incredibly pleasant.<br /><br />*product provided for my opinion and review\n",
      "368->Eh... | 3 | 12 | So first and foremost: I am a State Board Licensed nail tech and I have been doing nails for 15 years.<br /><br />I was a little leery of ordering product from Amazon but overall the quality of this wasn't bad. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the photos are a little deceptive: they are not black with glitter. They are colors with chunky glitter. Which might work for some but didn't create the look I wanted for my Halloween costume.<br /><br />Overall not a bad product. I wasn't impressed with the magnet cat eye effect - it's very minimal and barely noticeable. The glow in the dark feature is pretty cool and works well.<br /><br />Pro Tip- after looking through the photo reviews: keep your layers thinner. This formula, by nature of the chunky glitter, is on the thicker side, so keeping your layers thinner will prevent the lumpy mess I see in several of these photos.\n",
      "369->A bun maker that requires practice and needs lots of improvements! | 4 | 12 | This review will be separated into the following categories: appearance, how it looks in hair and durability, and improvements.<br /><br />The appearance of this donut bun maker is average. You can feel a flimsy wire inside the sponge, which holds the hair in place. The sponge itself looks easy to rip if you really tried to take it apart. I'm not too crazy over the design of this bun maker. I just get this sense of cheapness to this product... it's something that I would find at a small shop being sold much cheaper than how much it's being sold here on Amazon. I rate the appearance 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />This product definitely took a lot of time to figure out how to use. I've tried probably 6 or 7 times and my bun still looks pretty bad. I've even tried to do this on someone else and it doesn't look anything like how I want it. I definitely need more practice. I personally think the flimsy wire inside the sponge donut needs serious upgrading. My hair can't be held for long if I had it on for the whole day. It also gets loose whenever I do some physical activities. Another thing, I wish that for the ends of the buns had a hook on each side to hook together... that way I'll know that the bun won't fall apart. Also, whenever I take off the donut bun maker, it always looks twisted (pictured). It takes up few minutes to untwist it, which can be a pain sometimes. I rate how the bun looks and the durability of the bun maker 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />This product needs some serious improvements. The wire needs to be stronger, so it can withstand more hair and possibly a stronger material instead of the cheap spongy material they used to make this. I would also recommend providing different colored buns as not all hair colors are black.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this product 3 out of 5 stars. This product is cool but difficult to use. You'll need to get a lot of practice trying to use this and sometimes the end results can be different every time... like you might have a really good looking bun one time but when you do it again, it looks terrible. I like consistency and this product doesn't have that. I want a bun maker that is easy to use and is always (somewhat) perfect every time, and this product didn't cut it for me. I'm sticking to twisting my hair around in a bun and using a hairband to keep its shape.<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE 4/26/2016:<br />I would definitely like to applaud the customer service. They've read my review and have considered my input to improve their product. They reached out to me personally and addressed the cheap sponge material and replaced it with a stronger and thicker type of sponge. They've also upgraded the wire within the sponge, making it much stronger to keep the shape of the bun. Albeit, it's a totally different product and not the same one that is originally sent to me, but I definitely am pleased with their service. I've had many sellers in the past try and ask me to change my reviews or change the number of stars, but this seller is clearly looking for customer satisfaction and I totally respect that. I will be changing my review from 3 stars to 4 stars because of the great customer service and the improvement of material. The product worked better than the original, but I still won't use it on a daily basis.<br /><br />*NOTE: This product was offered to me for free/at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.\n",
      "371->Great product for the price. | 4 | 12 | Pros:<br />Low price.<br />Lots of hair included.<br />Very soft hair<br />Clips are strong (you do need to tease your hair before putting these in)<br />Color blended well with natural hair.<br />Straightens easy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Tangles horribly.<br />Doesn't curl well.<br />Lots of static before I flat ironed it<br /><br />Overall, for the price of this product, you get a pretty great deal. This is synthetic hair, so you can't expect to treat it the same as real human hair. I had to flat iron it as soon as I got it because it was so tangled and staticy, but as soon as I did that it calmed down and started behaving the way I wanted it to.\n",
      "374->Strong odor | 1 | 12 | Unfortunately, this product does have quite a strong smell that will alter whatever you add it to.<br />If I change my opinion after using more, I will update this review. But at the moment this seems like it was a waste of money for the purpose I intended it for.<br />Also, I included an image of the ingredients list on the bottle since they don’t include it in the listing which is totally unacceptable.

THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED ON MY FACE!!!!!!<br />I have had better shaves with the HOTEL razors in emergency packs. My first pull of the razor (after my shower and shaving cream on my face) was like using a very very dull blade right out of the package!! Just like some of the negative reviews I cut myself two places on the 2nd and 3rd strokes on my face!! DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR !!!!!<br /><br />A total ripoff!! Trust me.....this is a very very bad product!!!\n",

      "389->It stands up to its promises, unlike most products! | 4 | 12 | I really loved this mask!! It is one of the only wrinkle products that you can see a notice difference after! The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because it states that there are two masks in each one and there isn’t, it’s two halves to one mask, the bottom<br />And the top. With that being said you get three masks total, each order comes with three. But the masks themselves really adhere to the skin and it truly seems to fill in the lines, it’s really quite amazing actually! it feels so good on your skin! I recommend putting masks in fridge, they actually recommend it too. I also put the empty pack in the fridge and then use the rest of the serum for a few days until it’s gone! But it’s def worth it! I will be buying again! For people who are afraid to try it you should give it a shot! I’ve used a lot of products that promise a lot<br />Of things and this is one that stands up to those promises! If your looking to erase fine lines or even acne scars I strongly recommend it!\n",
      "391->Light, daily primer | 4 | 12 | I was a little leary about a spray but it feels so refreshing to spray on.  It also makes it much easier to use a light amount.  Considering the light amount you use, the size of this bottle is going to last FOREVER.  This really makes me more likely to use it daily vs just when going out.  It really does make a nice smooth surface to apply makeup to and reduces the powdering or blotchy look of your makeup.<br /><br />Do not let “moisturizing” fool you though, this isn’t like a bb cream, you do still need a separate moisturizer.  Also keep in mind it is “minimizing”, it doesn’t make your pores magically and completely disappear, especially if you have any enlarged pores.  It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br /><br />I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don’t have to worry about this not having it.  Between the affordable cost and the refreshing feel and scent this has definitely converted me to a daily primer user.\n",
      "395->Strong chemical smell | 1 | 12 | I have bought several makeup brushes sets in the past and this one by far was the worst. The bag had a very strong smell of chemicals and plastic which made me think the brushes were not even safe to use. I returned this item.<br /><br />The brushes did look good but I wouldn't use them. I tried to leave them opened for a couple of days and the odor was very strong still. I wouldn't recommend this product. I always think that having a good set of brushes is a must and tried to buy this set to try but was highly disappointed.<br /><br />I received this item with a discount for my honest review.\n",
      "397->Easy to clean but shave was not good | 1 | 12 | I decided to get rid of my last electric shaver (Panasonic ES8152NC) and go back to using a rotary one, so after looking around and reading reviews I deided to buy this shaver.<br /><br />The good things about it were that it looked cool, it was extremely easy to clean after each shave, and the battery lasts a long time.<br /><br />The only problem was that this thing can't cut.  When I first got it, it would sometimes pull hairs. I thought I just needed to get used to rotary head shaver again, but it's now been 1.5 months  and it's gotten worse. I have to go over the same are several times and it pulls hairs constantly... I even use the pre-lectric  preshave.\n",
      "399->Cute but some warnings | 3 | 12 | I have been ordering these for a while. They are very cute and do the trick way better than traditional hair ties. They are also long enough to capture all of my hair which is a feat.<br />I have some warnings though<br />-Do not use the &#34;glitter&#34;' ones in your hair! My hair gets hopelessly tangled in it and I always rip a ton of hair out<br />-These are not a long lasting purchase. They last about 2 weeks of daily wear (I use them every night to keep my hair off the pillow) before they're too stretched to be much good<br />-the plain ones always end up looking cuter because the patterns get stretched or fold in half with the no-pattern side up and just look ugly when actually in your hair\n",
      "402->Okay shampoo bar but not what it claims | 2 | 12 | So as shampoo goes it lathers up really well, The smell is decent but it does not do what it says no change in hair color at all whether beard or hair<br />I figured that it was false advertising but had some hope\n",
      "406->You'll use the whole bottle.... | 3 | 12 | If you're going for a true platinum finish and you haven't obtained it yet, there's some things you need to know. This bottle advertises that you'll be able to OBTAIN a platinum look with it, but I'm skeptical. I followed all the instructions carefully. After bleaching (twice), I obtained the lightness I was looking for but still had the brass, naturally. I rested my hair and hydrated it. Two days later, I applied this product to wet hair with gloves and rinsed after 2 minutes (per instructions). No results. I went right back in and reapplied for 5 minutes. Lighter, but still lots of brass. Using it the next time I shampooed, I left in for ten minutes. Lighter, but still brassy. See pictures. I will end up going through this entire bottle, I think, and don't know if I will be able to get the true ash white I'm looking for.<br /><br />The scent isn't offensive to me, but is a very strong orange scent, which is almost house-cleaner-ish instead of beauty-product-ish. Shrug. Not a deal breaker.<br /><br />The upside to this product instead of the T-18 Wella is that it's easier on your hair. Mine has no dryness after using multiple times. However, all told, I'm sure I'll be going back to Wella. Just too much effort to lift the brass from my hair. I like the one-and-done method.\n",
      "410->Rich lotion with an ingredient that I'm not a fan of. | 4 | 12 | It's me again. That Irish girl with the picky skin :)<br />This time we are trying Clia Natural Facial Moisturizer.<br />I like when a product has an easy to read ingredients panel, either on their product, or the accompanying box. If not, at least have on their product page a complete list of ingredients so I know what's in it, so I can make an informed decision if this is a product for me and my sensitive skin.<br />The box I received this product in was a simple, plain cardboard box.<br />The writing on the label is miniscule at best.<br />I blew up the attached images so I could read what it actually said. One of the first 5 ingredients is Palm Oil. I'm not a fan of Palm Oil for environmental reasons. The growth and harvest of palm oil is not kind to our planet. That's my personal feelings on the matter.<br /><br />The cream itself is very rich and smooth without a chemical smell, more like your typical face cream.<br />I did the back of my hand test first to check for a reaction. There was none, so the next morning I applied the cream to one half of my face for the &#34;face&#34; test.<br />This cream is VERY rich. Just lightly tap your fingers on the open jar, and you'll get just the right amount. A little goes a long way.<br />I applied it to my forehead, cheek and neck. It absorbed fairly quickly with no greasy residue.<br />DId it pass the no breakout, no hives test? Yes it did, and my skin felt softer throughout the day without drying out or leaving any dry patches.<br />Overall, it's a good, luxurious feeling lotion, but with that Palm Oil in there, i'm not 100% on board, so, I'm really at 3.75 stars on this product<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount for my honest review.\n",
      "412->Love this. I posted PICTURES 🥰 | 5 | 11 | [[VIDEOID:546f7d8d20cc97f990febb9a287e2]] I got this in yesterday. I made sure to post pictures as well. I originally bought this box so I can put the UV light in it along with all of my other nail stuff. It’s very durable. The red is very pretty, it’s my favorite color.<br /><br />I should’ve bought a bigger one. I will be on the lookout for one that’s bigger.  I would still like to purchase one that will be able to fit all my nail stuff in ALONG with my UV light. For $40 this was definitely worth it.\n",
      "413->A Surprising Find | 4 | 11 | I got this today and tried it out right away. I only had a couple minutes and was happy to discover it blends quickly and easily. I’m fussy about makeup and don’t like the look of anything too obvious. After initial application I used my hands to gently wipe away excess and help it melt into the skin, it made a big difference. As an aside, it was very difficult to wash off my hands so I suspect it won’t transfer all over the place. It lives up to its name and imparts a lovely glow but doesn’t look oily or greasy. So far I’ve had it on for five hours and it still looks pretty good. I did spray my face with a bit of water and blotted with a tissue. That really smoothed the areas that we’re looking a bit dry. I need to swap to a heavier winter moisturizer and and had done no skin prep prior to application. Given that I can’t judge this too harshly.<br /><br />As to the shade, it’s not prefect but close. I wear Cream in Hourglass Vanish foundation. I think that makes me close to NW15-20 in MAC. I feel like the cool tone version of 21 would work better, but this one is neutral enough I can make it work. A lot of times neutrals lean too warm but this one doesn’t seem too which means it’ll work for more people. I think depth wise it’s okay, but If you’re at all darker than me get the next shade up.<br /><br />At under $13 this is pretty incredible. It doesn’t come with a refill, but given the price I’m not going to complain. Please note if you’re buying this only for the compact my AmorePacific cushion doesn’t not fit in this at all. So if you use anything shaped like that it won’t work. You could just swap the sponge with the actual product though. I will for sure be keeping this case, my kids love it too!<br /><br />In the photo I’m also wearing Hourglass AL powder in Etherial Light, blush in Luminous Flush (also on eyes), and lip gloss in Cosmic Pink.\n",
      "415->Great serum that really works! | 5 | 11 | We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.\n",
      "422->14'16'18' and frontal 14' recommend to buy (Update) | 4 | 11 | [[VIDEOID:551d56ad234b4a22e48c2515ed575bde]] I bought this hair last week. I bought the hair for my nice and a made a wig for her. I have prime so the delivery was fast. After receiving the hair a pass my fingers through the lace frontal before I washed the hair was shedding a lit bit. I was scared. After I washed the shedding stop. I bleached the hair and thumbs up. The beautiful wave that comes after washed gone.  it has breakpoints hair and some red hair through the bundles and lace. But nothing that you cannot deal with and nobody can tell. For me, the bundles color was little darker than the frontal, but nobody can tell. However, the hair is beautiful, I really recommend buying this hair. I love the hair, it is beautiful a hair. Now, I just need to preplucked the hair to look more natural.  I RECOMMEND<br /><br />Sorry , I didn't bleached the hair. I bleached the knots and went well.\n",
      "426->Glad I found Florida Water | 5 | 11 | I just plain like this stuff.  The smell doesn't overwhelm, or last too long, but talk about astringent after shower and shave.<br />I hose off on my patio after yard work about 3 times a day, and I keep a bottle of this Florida Water on the back porch to use after each hosedown.<br />You'd have to be a guy to understand.\n",
      "427->Now to hunt for silver vanity trays! | 5 | 11 | I remembe, as a child, the old movies that had the elegant ladies getting dressed up, or preparing for bed, ALWAYS with lovley little atomizers like these, sitting on a silver tray next to their silver hand held mirros and their silver brush and comb...<br /><br />Just to see them takes me back to being that little girl and dreaming of having some of my very own.  I never really thought I would find then, but, now at the age of 48, I have hit the jackpot!<br /><br />When my first set arrived, I wasn't expecting them so soon.  When I opened the box, and moved the bubble wrap, I seriously nearly started crying!  I wa so surprised, even though I had ordered them, it felt like someone read my mind and sent them to me!<br /><br />SO silly, but so true!<br /><br />I now have three sets here, and one on the way, leaving just one more for my next order!<br /><br />Since they do come in pairs, I will let my two teens choose some for themselves, unless I buy them their own sets, unwilling to give up a single one of MINE!  &#60;LOL&#62;  I would rather split a set, though, as a binding keepsake, in that we each hold one half of the set.\n",
      "431->Good Quality, But Wish They Offered Smaller Packs. | 4 | 11 | First things first, I bought the copper red (#33) extensions in 22\". When I bought them I had the carrot top, \"ginger red\" color, which these did not match, at all. It didnt bother me too much because I was fine dying my hair a bit darker so long as it was still red, which these are, but if you are trying to match a natural red hair I'd recommend trying a different shade.<br /><br />My fiance applied these for me; he followed a diagram I found online for placement (google images), sandwiched my hair between two extensions then used my flat iron on the top bit to seal the extensions together. If you don't know what I mean, I highly recommend searching on YouTube for a tutorial or two.<br /><br />I only bought one set, and it ended up being just about perfect for me because my hair is naturally very fine and I have trouble hiding a ton of extensions. I just wish I had two more \"sandwiches\" for the front as it does look a bit choppy at the front of my head. Luckily I have clip ins to help here when I dont want to clip the shorter hairs out of my face. If you have anything beyond thin, fine hair get 2 - 3 packs.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they dont offer smaller packs. I wish they offered a half pack, so you arent faced with another $50 for a few more strands.<br /><br />Aside from that the hair is very soft and I've been able to style it how I want without issue. I haven't washed my hair yet, but I'll update if I experience any issues there.\n",
      "432->Best styling product for thick curly hair. EVER. | 5 | 11 | I have tried KCCC (leaves hair crunchy and needs lots of maintainance between application), hair gel (as a daily wash-n-go) and then I found THIS. I  went to the salon as recommended by a friend and learned how to apply it. I use it to set my hair under a hood dryer or as a wash-n-go, or just air dry and I ALWAYS get great results. Hair doesn't frizz and and keeps a consistent curl pattern. I don't run from humid weather and my curls come out different depending on the humidity if I air dry it -but never frizzed! I wash and reapply every 3 (as instructed) to 5 days (when I'm cheating). I recently went to Miss Jessie's bc a friend told me their styling products last a week but I found the routine to have too many steps so back to Curly Whip. A 32 oz bottle lasts me approx 6 weeks - I have 3C hair. I used to use the Hair Rules shampoo and conditioner but I have also had good results with other brands and the curly whip.<br /><br />Please resume carrying the 32 oz bottle!\n",
      "433->Cute but.... | 3 | 11 | The wig itself is beautiful however it’s not completely full in the back. I’m actually purchasing a pack of pre-twisted passion twist to fill in the gaps. Due to the wig itself having braids I’m able to crochet the other hair.<br />Overall cute but the price could be cheaper considering the back of the wig!\n",
      "434->Water is wet! | 3 | 11 | Ok, first off, I have a small patch’s where I left chemicals on my hair to long.  I bought this to help grow the hair back.<br /><br />While the hair is growing back, I am not entirely sure this product has helped any, I still have about 3/4 left.<br />It’s been about two/three weeks and today in the mail I got an envelope from an unknown person.<br /><br />Inside was some weird gold, metal, leaf thing.  I have no idea what it is.  Anyway, the letter was basically if I give a 5 star review, I get a few bottle or $20 gift card.<br /><br />I don’t buy things for “gifts”, I buy because I need it and if it works, I’ll probably buy again.  This product, is expensive for the size and I don’t think it did any good, so no I’m not giving a 5 star review, I don’t want a free bottle or $20 Amazon gift card. Thanks, but no thanks!\n",
      "435->What I liked and what I didn’t like | 4 | 11 | This frontal was amazing!<br />What I liked: The shipping was great i got it in couple of days.<br />The frontal looks just like the pictures and how it was described.<br />The frontal did not lose its curl pattern after washing it and spraying it with water to brush it out(it went right back to that kinky curly after it dried).<br />The frontal had almost no shedding<br />What I didn’t like: I did not like the lace, it appears to be that hard brown lace instead of Swiss lace( When putting my Tpins through it to hold it on the block head and then taking it out you can see the holes and they are not bigger than usual... never had that happen before)<br />When I bleached the knots on the frontal it did not really bleach when I applied it the first time so I had to do it a second time and it still didn’t bleach some areas.<br />Overall it was a good frontal and the price was good, I would recommend this.\n",
      "436->Another Norelco | 3 | 11 | I spent several weeks researching to replace my 8 year old Norelco shaver.  I have had norelco shavers for the last 30+ years.  The most frustrating part about researching Norelco shavers is that there are just so many different models.  I finally decided on the 7180XL and I have had it now for a year.  After having Norelco shavers for so long, I know what I need and like.  This new shaver has been good so far but definately not the build quality, or the solid feel of the previous 5825XL, which I have had for the last 8 years.  This new shaver is not as quiet as it was when new, and it takes a bit longer to get a good complete shave, but the shave is decent overall.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the loose fitting head.  The battery charge does not last as long as the old shaver, but I really do like cleaning the shaver under the water faucet.  I purchased the shaver from Amazon, no problems.  I would recommend this shaver; it's better than most at the price.\n",
      "445->Great shave and great warranty | 4 | 11 | In reading the comments I noticed that almost no one compared different shavers.<br />I have used a Norelco for years but I wanted something that was better and quicker to use on a two or three day beard.  I have a Philips Norelco 4500.  I bought the Wahl Smart Shave and the Braun 3040s.<br />After a two week trial I came up with the following observations.<br />On all three the blades float so they stay close to the face as you shave.<br />On the Norelco and the Wahl the head swivels too.  It’s nice but I would not miss it if it were not there.<br />The Norelco is smoother and quieter than the other two.  It is also the easiest to clean.  It only takes one hand. Norelco recommends (and it is true) that saving in a circular motion works the best with their shaver.<br />The Norelco and the Wahl have Lithium batteries.  The Braun has an NiMH battery.  I like the Lithium.<br />I think the Wahl and the Braun shave closer than the Norelco but they are all close.<br />As for the trimmers, they all cut about the same.  I would not buy a shaver without it. The Wahl is harder to manipulate.  It has a nice metallic finish but that makes it hard to move up or down.  It slips under your thumb.<br />The Wahl has the better battery and charge level indicator and a five year warranty. Wahl replacement head and blades are not on Amazon now.  The Braun blades are easier to replace and the part is available on Amazon. Norelco blades are also easy to replace and available on Amazon.<br />I like all three shavers.  For those with a light beard or with a medium beard and you shave every day I would recommend the Norelco.  For those with a heavy or a three day beard I would recommend the Braun.\n",
      "447->See the other reviews | 1 | 11 | I wish I had checked the others reviews prior to buying it for my sister!<br />As for my sisters feedback<br />1. smelt great<br />2. no improvement at all<br />3. was sorry I wasted my money<br /><br />EVERY SINGLE review 4 stars and up with the exception of 1 only have one written review!

      "450->if you like that flaxmeal/hempseed sort of taste you'll like this oil | 4 | 11 | This is a large UV-protected BPA-free plastic bottle. I've been slathering it all over myself to see what effect it had topically. I personally like the smell-it's a soft wheaty-flaxy-earthy smell. It smells like something real which is what it is; nothing else but the real cold-pressed oil. I also like the taste which is similar to the smell. I haven't tried it yet but think it might be able to be used as the oil in salad dressings- if you like the taste. As to the topical effect well first it just sits on your skin but after a minute or two it just disappears into your skin which continues to smell faintly of the smell I mentioned above. I think it does the job of softening skin- a sort of hydrating, softening effect on my hands which already were fine so the effect isn't noticeably apparent. My feet seem to be loving this stuff (put socks on after you put the oil on!) and seem to be smoother and stay that way all day. I actually bought it to eat- and from what I've read one or two teaspoons a day is a good amount for those who aren't sure if they get enough vitamin E in their diet<br /> (salad greens, whole wheat, sunflower seeds etc) I have read that vitamin E is antagonistic to estrogen so if you are on the pill you should see if this has any negative effects when taking the pill- I don't know the answer. In general too much estrogen isn't a good thing so perhaps this characteristic of vitamin E would be helpful to some- especially men who are worried about too much estrogen? Anyway you don't want to take too much of anything in particular and you can take too much vitamin E (fat soluble )but as far as I can tell that amount is more than a 'reasonable person' would think of taking anyway. I have only taken it for two days internally and already notice that my hands and feet seem to be a lot warmer and since it's supposed to be good for circulation that's to be expected. The company that makes it, Naissance, British, sourced from Scotland, has tried to make a topnotch product and I think has achieved it. I contacted the company several times with questions and they speedily answered them with friendly, helpful answers and were willing to do what was necessary to make me happy with my purchase. I will definitely buy from them from now on.\n",
      "454->Be careful with acne-prone skin | 4 | 11 | I really like Yes To products, but if you have sensitive/acne-prone skin you should be careful with this conditioner.<br /><br />After using this conditioner for a few days I noticed that it was causing me to break out on my back and neck. I like everything else about the conditioner, it leaves my hair feeling really soft and protects my hair in the dry winter months. If you suffer from acne-prone skin, make sure you are using a cleanser after this conditioner to reduce the chance of forming a breakout.\n",
      "464->PROS and CONs | 4 | 10 | I’ve been single-blade shaving for about 5 years. I enjoy trying out different blades and soaps. This is one of my stand-byes so I can recommend this soap.<br /><br />1. SHAVE: EXCELLENT.  Mitchell’s is very slick and leaves very little tendency to cut or scrape. It results in a close, smooth shave in two passes. Most premium soaps result in a good-to-excellent shave.<br /><br />2. SKIN: EXCELLENT. This product contains lanolin and results in the very best and softest after-shave experience of any soap I’ve tried.  Most premium soaps result in a fair-to-good experience for me.<br /><br />3. VERSATILITY: GOOD. Some soaps seem to shave very well with one brand of blade and not others. Mitchell’s doesn’t seem to mind. I use ASTRA and generally sharp blades.<br /><br />4. LATHER: FAIR. This soap deposits easily onto a wet badger brush, sufficient to lather onto the skin and shave well. It does not whip into a full thick lather if that is important to you. It is also reputed (I have no direct experience) to be difficult to lather at all if you have hard water.<br /><br />5. LATHER DURABILITY: GOOD. The lather on the brush lasts OK during the shave. Easily enough for two passes.<br /><br />6. PUCK DURABILITY: EXCELLENT.  I tend to rotate among several brands of soap, and most milled soaps collect enough water from the brush to decay and dry out somewhat before the puck is finished. Mitchell’s lasts to the end.<br /><br />8. VALUE: FAIR. Mitchell’s is priced about the same as other premium milled soaps. However, if it is sold as a bare replacement puck so you will need a shaving bowel or other container.\n",
      "466->Not ideal for very pale skin, but usable | 4 | 10 | For the record, I am a longtime Physicians Formula wearer, and their products can be hit or miss. I am not being paid to leave a review, or representing anyone but myself here. This is the first time I tried PF's countouring powder, and I've used it for about three seasons. I like it. I don't love it.<br /><br />I have very pale skin with pink undertones that is uber-sensitive and I have to be very careful about sun exposure. Anything can make me break out in hives or eczema, at any time, even if I used it daily for years. Thankfully, PF products have never done that to me, in almost a decade.<br /><br />As for this product, the shades are where I take some issue. They worked best for my tone in summer, but now, in winter -- I'm shopping for a different product.<br /><br />* The dark shade is really mahogany-like, so I have to blend, blend, blend in daylight or risk looking like I smeared mud on my face. It's good for shading jawline and cheekbones with a light touch at temples if you need it. Beware, though. If you are very pale, you want a very light touch with this one.<br /><br />*The medium shade is very subtle and helps blend and soften the dark. It also works well as a matte bronzer, around sides of the nose, and wherever you need just a little definition. This is the best shade of the bunch, honestly. At least for my skin tone.<br /><br />* The light shade is, frankly, worthless to me. It gives my skin a pasty, chalky look and looks heavy. Yuck. I occasionally use it in tiny spots as a concealer, but as a contour powder, it just looks like I put on way too much setting powder or something. Instead, I use my lightest shade of matte eyeshadow (also a PF product) and a higher-end illuminator for highlighting. Those results are beautiful, frankly, even on my 38 year old skin.<br /><br />All in all, PF's contour colors are suitable for pale skin, but may be better on other slightly darker or warmer skin tones, or on summer tanned skin.\n",
      "467->Lavender hurts when you get it in your eye. | 4 | 10 | People are likely reacting to the lavender.<br />It doesn't make it a bad product, so if you've had a reaction, stop using it. But it doesn't mean everyone is going to have a reaction.<br />Most people's eyes will sting. Lavender in the eye really sucks.<br />Micellular water in the eye does too.<br />Micellular Water and lavender in the eye is really painful. I recommend using a Q tip to remove eye makeup.<br />I have used micellular water in other brands.<br />This does an ok job. It's very comparable.<br />But I'm sensitive to the lavender, which sucks because I love the calming scent.<br />The pump is a nice touch.. But it's on the cheap side. If you shake the bottle, it will spill out from the pump if you don't cover that hole.<br />If I wasn't sensitive to the lavender, it'd be worth purchasing again.\n",
      "470->great for $5! | 4 | 10 | came on time, ordered dec 31 and came jan 23 which was expected date. opened it and the box came a little crushed, which doesn't matter to me because the product inside was safe and undamaged. my gf has a similar one to this (at a higher pricepoint) and they are about the samesize (on the smaller side), and look very similar. the brush heads do not feel like they will irritate your skin, and i recieved all 5 of them (which i worried about because this product didnt have any reviews). however, there is a latex sponge for \"massaging\" so beware if youre allergic. i have not actually used this to wash my face, so i am not sure what the performance is like but i have high hopes as of now! this is great if youre up with skincare on a budget. it also takes AA batteries which are not included. i am satisfied so far and its great for the price!!<br /><br />edit: it can be a little harsh depending on how you use it. i found for me it works best on low power.\n",
      "473->Curly Hair | 4 | 10 | These flexi-rods are essentially the same as those that you would purchase at your local beauty supply store.  The thing I like about the Ohuhu pack is that you have seven varying sizes and colors.  There are six of each size.  It also comes with the storage bag, as shown, which is great for storage and if you need to travel with them.  They run about $13, as of the date of this review.  The price isn't bad at all.<br /><br />These are great if you want spiral curls or to add curls to the ends of your hair.  If you are looking to do a full-body style, start at the back of your neck (nape) and use the smaller rods, working your way up to the bigger rods when you get to the middle and top of your hair.<br /><br />They are super easy to use and because they are soft, it is not too difficult to sleep in.<br /><br />Of note, I was sent these flex-rods directly, at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",
      "478->Superb battery life | 4 | 10 | [[VIDEOID:dbb8ac3f70bdf066f4c48a148e88e822]] Great value for the money. Tip: if you're not a reader like me, the lawn mower will likely come with travel lock engaged. Simply tap the power button 3 times to unlock. After a full charge, I've used the lawn mower a handful of times and still don't need to charge.<br /><br />Lawn mower seems to have a better value than the weed whacker. So if you're debating on which bundle to buy, the lawn mower is a great value on it's own.<br /><br />The weed whacker doesn't have much power in my opinion. I'll likely return to my MicroTouch Trimmer for ear/nose trimming.\n",
      "482->BEWARE of 3rd Party Sellers - Rcv'd 2 X 30-ct (inferior) Wipes Instead of 1 X 60-ct Larger Wipes | 2 | 10 | FIRSTLY - make sure you're ordering the larger 60-ct packs and not 2 X 30-ct wipes by mistake. I was careful but still received the wrong item from a 3rd party seller.<br /><br />SECONDLY, a reminder - that the larger, 60-ct wipes are far superior to the smaller 30-ct wipes! The 30-ct wipe packs have THIN wipes that are SMALL and fragile - not great for all-purpose use - like a damp Kleenex! The larger 60-ct packs are superior in every way: they smell better, they are larger, they are stronger, and they have more moisture. The 60-ct pack even has a nice plastic, click-to-close lid. One of the larger wipes is good for wiping face, neck, arms and even legs with one wipe. The small ones are dry and torn before you're done wiping your hands. The small wipes will tear on the slightest beard stubble. Woof. Only advantage of the small packs, is the small pack. LOL<br /><br />BEWARE of 3rd parties selling what seems to be the large wipes \"60-ct\" when in fact they ship 2 X 30-ct (60-ct) wipes instead. This seller even had a photo of the large pack of wipes but sent 2 X 30-ct packs. Woof.\n",
      "485->Hello QC5055, Goodbye Flowbee :) | 4 | 10 | For more than one reason, I haven't seen the insides of a hair-cuttery in more than a decade. Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try Norelco's 'Power Hair Clipper', model QC5055.<br /><br />I am unlikely to ever return to Flowbee now because the QC5055 does the job much faster, it's less noisy and delivers a much better quality haircut.<br /><br />Operation:<br /><br />Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.<br /><br />Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I'm a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy. From time to time, you may have to clean the comb and/or the clipping attachment but that can be done quickly and easily. My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.<br />- The clipping attachment<br />- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades<br />- Large comb<br />- Small comb<br />- Stubble comb<br />- Charger<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- English/Spanish instructions<br />- Registration card with $20 coupon offer<br /><br />Some specs:<br /><br />- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.<br />- Charge time is 10 hours.<br />- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.<br />- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)<br /><br />Returns and warranties:<br /><br />There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.<br /><br />The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase, of course, is a must.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a 'corded' mode. The comfortable, rubberized grip makes hair cutting, even self-cutting easy and efficient.<br /><br />The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn't, it gets 4.<br /><br />I still recommend the QC5055 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tools or maybe misplace the essential charger.\n",
      "487->Highly recommended brush! | 5 | 10 | Light weight and easy to hold. Bought this brush few weeks ago and I am very satisfied from it.<br />Affordable, high quality and the handle is very light and comfortable to hold! Happy to say that I use my blow dry every day to straighten my hair and most brushes make my hair look fizzy but this one does not make my hair fizzy at all! I'm giving this one 5 stars since I have been looking for brush like this for a while!\n",
      "488->No. No, no, no, no, no. | 2 | 10 | So, I used this as directed, on pits and other areas. This particular scent I wasn't fond of, but that's personal preference. Everything was fine, applied after each shower, no complaints.<br />  Then I had a day I skipped the shower and stayed in bed all day (migraines). Next day, holy cats. This was not a, \"Oh, time for a shower, starting to get a bit odiferous.\" This was a, \"OMG DO YOU STINK!\" It literally smelled like someone living in a dumpster for several weeks.<br />  But I thought, when it stops working, it STOPS working. Good to know. But then the same exact scent emanated from the groin area. Ladies' pits and groins do not create the same chemical reaction/odors. This was not a lack of odor protection, this is creating the odor.<br />  It could very well just be my body chemistry, but this one does NOT work for me.\n",
      "489->Best natural (for the most part) tanning lotion! Smells freaking amazing! | 5 | 10 | I'm on my second bottle.<br />1. It feels soft, smooth & non-greasy.<br />2. It has a light bronze tint, and I never get streaks.<br />3. It has natural bronzers & no DHA or anything that irritates my sensitive (pale!) skin.<br />4. THE SMELL IS THE BEST. It lingers all day but it doesn't STANK! No ATO. I love this scent! Favorite I have tried.<br /><br />This lotion will stay forever in my tanning lotion rotation.<br />One negative. Sorry, amazon, but I can get this lotion cheaper elsewhere.\n",
      "490->Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have | 5 | 10 | We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.\n",
      "492->Great for Smooth Skin | 4 | 10 | Cons:<br />I bought these because it would supposedly also help you save on soap by creating loads of lather. I do not notice that effect. In fact, I would say I notice less lather.  I do not use traditional soap, however, and instead use handmaid castile soap. So, instead I just lather up first, and then use this cloth, and it's not a huge deal.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this cloth can be too abrasive if used with any pressure on some parts of my skin. So, lathering up and then using the cloth also helps me to only use this abrasive cloth where I need it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great for those little bumps.<br /><br />Fantastic at exfoliation for shaving, waxing, any hair removal, etc.<br /><br />Helps with ingrown hairs! But be careful not to press too hard when using it. Go over multiple times at a lighter pressure rather than pressing too hard, which can have the opposite effect and actually cause ingrown hairs.<br /><br />WONDERFUL at keeping my feet smooth! I don't even use anything else now.<br /><br />Do recommend, just not for the reasons I originally purchased.\n",
      "496->You need a lot of product to get the white color they're showing in the photos... | 3 | 10 | Works as advertised, but you need a lot to make your hair as white as the images they are showing as examples.<br /><br />I have short black hair, so take that into consideration, as black is difficult to get a full white coverup.<br />But when styling my hair with regular wax, I use about 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon for styling.<br /><br />To get white coverage with this wax, I need to use 3-5 times that much of this product.<br /><br />Also - it's cool to know that it's actually just zinc oxide they use for the white coloring - safe sunscreen mineral.\n",
      "501->Flawless Foundation | 5 | 10 | My friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing!\n",
      "508->A quick hack fixes the over-dispensing problem | 3 | 10 | I thought I was so great.  Yes, I had read all the reviews saying these tubes dispense far too much sanitizer at once.  But I was going to be careful, not like those *other* Amazon customers who don't know how to work a squeeze bottle.  Well, the bottles arrived, and sure enough, they are so determined to be leak-proof that when you squeeze them, nothing happens until all of a sudden an olive-sized dollop of product comes out in one big \"blurp!\" Being gentle does not help; the dispensing is all or nothing.  I might try to MacGyver a solution by poking a small hole somewhere to try to fix this problem, but for now these bottles are too annoying to use.  The good: 1) These come in black to be less obvious when dangling from a dark bag, though this camouflage is slightly undermined by the white cap.  2) The carabiner for clipping to a purse/backpack is handy.<br />EDIT: Fixed the all-or-nothing dispensing problem by using scissors to make a tiny slit in one of the \"petals\" surrounding the tiny opening.  Now a slight squeeze gives the desired small amount of product.\n",
      "510->get the Vitality . . . | 3 | 10 | Braun's competitively priced electric powered toothbrushes are very good values and reliable performers.  Most models use the same rotating type replacement toothbrush heads.<br /><br />The Advance Power 4500PX Bright D4510, like most electric toothbrushes that use AA batteries, delivers significantly lower brushing torque than a toothbrush with a built-in rechargeable battery, such as Braun's Vitality model.  The Vitality may cost a little more, but it delivers a lot more brushing power, and the high capacity battery allows for many uses between recharges.<br /><br />Both Braun models will do a good job, however the faster more powerful Vitality, will probably get more done in the same amount of time.  Given the small price differential, and long life rechargeable battery, the Vitality would seem to be a much better value.  Those who prefer a more gentle brushing action, can go with the 4500PX, or any of the multitude of AA battery powered toothbrushes available.\n",
      "512->a little disapointed | 3 | 10 | I agree that it is hard to find this kind of heating iron with the brush teeth, so I ordered this thinking it would be more up to date than the v. old slow-to-heat conair I have.<br /><br />well, this Helen of Troy heating iron is not any better than the old ones I have.  it is sloooow to heat up !!!  it also feels cheaper than my old versions.  and although it has a plastic cap on the end of the heated part, it seems a little on the skimpy side and I would feel safer and less nervous if the protective cap was more generous.  also, the teeth of the brush are rubbery, bendable...makes it feel even cheaper.<br /><br />All in all, I wanted to return it --- but then I realized that by the time I paid all the postage, I would only get $10 back.  So I kept it.  But seriously, if I had bought it from a store, I would have taken it back.\n",
      "513->it's small and powerful | 5 | 10 | So far I have no issue with the product.<br />Just note that first few times you may have an issue bleeding when using the product, which is normal.<br />After a few use it will get better and you will no longer bleed.<br />Good product at a great price.\n",
      "514->Great Color Mix! | 4 | 10 | [[VIDEOID:d010ece8d43b68cbe6e2101e19e10843]] Four stars because I like to have a root in my hair so I had to add my own. The color quality is amazing for the price! The wig had tones of pink and peach which made it look more natural. It had some brown in it to extend the color range to add a more realistic look to it. The shine was not too bad and by adding dry shampoo it took most of it away. The lace is fairly light Which can be nice because it makes it easy for any concealer or powders to show up to match skin tone. I have a fairly small head and the straps adjusted enough to fit my head. If you are looking for a bublegum pink, this is not it. If you are looking for a &#34;natural&#34; but stunning hair color, this is beautiful.<br /><br />**Picture is after I added root<br />**Video is of the wig when I first got it with a little unicorn headband\n",
      "515->I don't recommend it. | 1 | 10 | I didn't get Plexaderm trough Amazon; nevertheless, I said the results don't last long. On the contrary, even though I have no wrinkles; only tired eyes and poufiness appearance, I noticed that after the product gets dry, the skin gets with some crepe vertical line on that area. I don't recommend it.<br />5/26/18\n",
      "518->I love these nails, but... | 4 | 10 | I bought this because I was wanting to try fiberglass without spending a ton on something I might hate. I definitely do not hate these nails! They are thin and natural looking, and still super strong. I will absolutely continue using fiberglass nails.<br /><br />BUT... They are a bit of a pain to use, and some of that pain is actual, physical pain from getting fiberglass stuck in your skin. I'd advise using gloves, and will follow my own advice on that going forward. Fiberglass is actual wee little glass fibers which are nearly impossible to see and remove when you get a bit stuck in your skin and can be really irritating and painful. I ended up smearing my hands with tacky glue, letting it dry, and then peeling it off to get rid of the it. It worked pretty well, but yeah, gloves.<br /><br />The gel in this set cured well, and as I said, my nails are very strong. I used Young Nails Protien Bond and the base coat, and so far no lifting whatsoever, when I usually would start seeing some.<br /><br />The little LED light is cute, but I wouldn't ever use it for curing nails. I have a better light and I halved the recommending curing times since they're given for the tiny lamp.<br /><br />There's a little tin of loose fibers, which I'm not sure how to use.<br /><br />The set also comes with two completely useless pairs of tweezers, which I just tossed.\n",
      "519->Pros and cons | 4 | 10 | Pros-<br />This mascara will not budge. If you have a hiking trip/apocalypse prep etc and want to put it on  and be good for days-this is the product. It separates lashes wonderfully.<br />Cons-<br />You need an oil based makeup remover. It sticks lashes together when you try to layer it. It’s drying.<br />My verdict/experience-<br />I love a mascara that sticks. If I am hiking or busy, last thing I want to do is reapply mascara. Yes, I am that pale pale woman who looks ill without it-mascara stays. Because this mascara is so drying, I like to do a coat or two of Neutrogena and use this as a sealer of sorts. That way my lashes stay conditioned, but also water, weather and zombie apocalypse proof.\n",
      "520->I tried, but it didn't work for me | 1 | 10 | YES! I finally emptied the container, I'm finished and I wont ever use it again.<br />Unfortunately, I can not recommend this product, as it did not work for me.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Unscented<br />- Its Natural/Aluminum-free Deodorant (As a former Peace Corps volunteer who completed my 27-month commitment, I really appreciate natural alternatives)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-  I smelled. Unlike a reviewer who mentioned how they enjoyed letting their armpits breath and bask in the naturalness, I do not, and after about 5 hours my armpits smelled, which means I had to spend the last 3 hours at my office hoping and praying others could not smell me.<br /><br />-  I hated applying/pasting my armpit with deodorant like a savage. Using a small wooden stick to paste deodorant to your armpit feels wrong. After a while i got 'used' to it, but I never liked it.<br /><br />-  I got small red rashes under my armpits. This may be due to the fact that my arms were rubbing together for the 1st time, as I had to trim my hair to get the deodorant to work for more than 2 hours.<br /><br />-  Its expensive AND it only lasted ONE month. Normally, each rolling stick of Gillette/OldSpice will last me at least 3 months....this is just not economical.....$11 for 3 ounces....is a very poor fiscal decision in my book.<br /><br />Additions:<br />I really tried. I used the product until every last drop was gone. I wanted to see if my body just needed time to adjust. I noticed that the deodorant last maybe 2 hours with my little armpit hairs, so I shaved, not with a razor, with a trimmer, gave it a nice minimalist look. One month later I still smelled. Daily, I would rush home and use my Dr.Bonners to wash away the armpit funk. God forbid I actually worked up a sweat/perspired from doing something that day, then I would almost immediately smell. It was not enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />- Release a version for MEN (in my Ron Swanson voice)<br />- Eliminate the wooden stick, release a rolling stick version<br />- Release a larger size, for the same cost (Seriously.)<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I live in NYC and walk 1/2 block to the metro, 4 blocks to the office and back, five days a week...\n",
      "530->Ruined my nails :( | 2 | 10 | I was so excited to find this product. When applied correctly, it did wear extremely well- much longer than normal polish.<br />The only drawback is that it was very harsh on my nails! I used it continuously for three to four polish changes (approx 8 weeks) and now my nails (and toenails!) look like they did after removing my acrylics- brittle, dry; a total mess. The nails grow a little and then they split---my hands look terrible. I was SO bummed. I will not be using this again- it'll take months to get my nails back in decent shape.\n",
      "536->Great Beginner Poly Gel Artificial Nail Kit With Small Uv Lamp | 5 | 10 | [[VIDEOID:c623991ad780dd5e81ec8f36d09cb107]] Wow this is a GREAT Poly Gel Artificial Nail Kit!<br /><br />You get so much in this kit and it’s all great quality! It comes with 4 glitter colors (black, white, purple and green), 1 Spatula tool on one end and Brush on the other (brush has tight bristles that are rounded at a point), 3 Poly Gel Nail Gel colors in 002, 003, 005, 1 Soak Off Base Coat Polish (labeled on the bottle), 1 Soak off Top Coat Polish (labeled on the bottle), 4 Poly Gel Nail Colors (light blue, grayish blue, royal blue and aqua blue which aren’t labeled which color is what but read my solution for that below), blue and green watercolor foil which there’s no instruction on how to apply that on the nails, different holographic colored foil strips, Poly gel Artificial Nails, UV LIGHT Lamp with charge cord (the lamp has hidden stands that pull out and only works when plugged in. The adapter isn’t included but I use my phones charging adapter and it works fine), 1 Pink Nail File with strong grit on both sides of the file and a blue buffer on one side and then a white side on the back that I use to make my real nails shiny) and last but not least a small storage container with secure clasps and a handle for safe storage as well as a instruction booklet.<br /><br />THIS KIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RUBBING ALCOHOL YOU MUST HAVE WHEN DOING THESE TYPE OF NAILS! Any rubbing alcohol will do (store bought is fine). DO NOT USE ACETONE (Nail polish remover it won’t work).<br /><br />This is a great beginners kit and I’m excited to actually try it out on actual my nails. I tried one nail not on me so I color practice since it was my first time doing these type of nails, and so far so good!<br /><br />The only con about this kit is I don’t like... #1 The UV lamp isn’t very powerful. I definitely suggest buying one that is more heavy duty and has higher wattage (you can always use it on gel nails or on regular polish to cut drying time in half) and #2 The nail color doesn’t have any way of telling which bottle is what color. I just took a dot tool and dipped it in the color and put a dot on the middle of the top of the poly gel nail polish cap (there’s a indented circle that it fits perfectly on) but it’s hard to see the darker blue when doing this but you’ll know what that color is by process of elimination 😉\n",
      "537->Is it edible? | 3 | 10 | Well, the description on Amazon says 100% Pure, Food Grade, USP Pharmaceutical...\"<br />But, when I got the bottle, it says \"for external use only\" and \"keep out of the reach of children\"! This doesn't sound like something I want to eat, and that is what I got it for! Got to return, not going to eat this and take my chances.\n",
      "541->Don't like this | 2 | 10 | I tried to like it.  Good shipping speed, good price, packaged well.  But it doesn't smell like sandalwood to me, not even a tiny bit.  It smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet.  Sigh.<br /><br />Also, I would like to mention that when it arrived the roller ball was broken - stuck inside the cap.  FYI - it is not returnable, to anyone thinking about ordering this.  I've emailed the seller to ask how they will make this right and am currently awaiting reply.\n",
      "546->Good work at an incredible price | 5 | 10 | I was pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied with this brush. First a note on the pics. I took the before pic on the left after hair had been washed, dried, brushed with a regular brush, with no product (oil, conditioner, balm, etc.) put into the beard. I then used the brush and took the pic before applying any product to style it. For something to straighten your beard quickly on days you don't wash it, this was very easy to use. It heats up fast (about a min) and within about 1-2 minutes, I was done.<br /><br />As you will notice, my beard is shorter on the sides and even my chin area isn't super long. I found the shorter bristles on this brush compared to bigger brushes meant for women's hair to work better for my beard. Also, I found it did a great job if you go slowly and comb UP from under the chin first. Then go back and brush it slowly down the other side. The extension cord is plenty long. The only downside of that is that it can make storage a challenge. I don't like wrapping the cord around the brush itself. So I had picked up some cheap velcro cord wraps from Amazon a few years ago and added one to the cord to make it easier to put away.<br /><br />I bought this to keep at the office. But for the price, I think I'll go back and pick up one more for the house and another to keep in my gym bag. I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to any guy with a short to medium beard.\n",
      "550->interesting oil -- using it for Rosacea | 4 | 9 | I purchased this oil to use when my skin is inflamed and i have a bad rosacea flare-up. It kind of smells early, or like walnuts but it isn't offensive. It is a color that reminds me of olive oil...yellow with a tinge of green. It goes on smoothly and my face soaks it up pretty quickly (but I do not have oily skin so maybe that is just my personal experience). The smell wears off after a while so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I have noticed a difference in my skin after using it for many weeks now. I believe it is helping with my rosacea. My one complaint is that the dropper drips so I have to be careful when using it so it doesn't get all over the place...small price to pay to have a happier, healthier face that is free of the burning sensation of rosacea.\n",
      "551->Get it at Costco for $3.99 | 1 | 9 | KIRKLAND is the Costco brand. You can get it directly from Costco for $3.99 for the same size jar. We've been purhasing this brand of Saigon Cinnamon from Costco for several years (no exaggeration).<br /><br />Why pay $6 more per container, plus shipping?\n",
      "555->Easy to do, little to no time needed | 4 | 9 | I was actually going to return this the minute it got delivered because of some of the reviews… but since I got the notification that I could keep the product, I decided to try it out.<br />And to my surprise it really is a great product. I don’t know if this photo will do it justice. I tried getting as close as possible to show how it looks.<br />I did light strokes and love the way they came out.<br />This is the brunette color.<br />And for my first time doing this I think this is amazing.<br /><br />Also, please note that I do not have anything else on or around my eyes. I applied this bare face.\n",
      "556->Dry, Brittle, Frizzy Mess | 1 | 9 | The leave in felt like I was applying hairspray to my hair. Instead of moisturizing my hair, it made it more dry, brittle, and unmanageable. When I tried to detangle my wet hair with this, it formed clumps of knots as if I applied a styling gel (pic included). And when I tried the leave in with my hair dry, it felt like I had just applied hair spray because it felt stiff and dry (pic included; with the orange shirt). In both pics you can also see how frizzy it made my hair. On top of that, the scent is very overpowering! It smelled like cheap, floral perfume. Not pleasant at all! I obtained a refund for this:/<br />My hair type: dry, bleached, 2a-2c wave/curl pattern\n",
      "562->Don't hesitate buy this unit asap | 5 | 9 | Light as a feather  , very cute for daily wear, very functional and looks much more expensive than some wigs I've paid a lot more for wigs and I still choose to wear this one!<br />It's light as a feather very comfortable. All I did was conceal the part doesn't need slot of work. This unit is awesome I bought 2 more if that tells you anything!<br />I haven't noticed any Shedding and I wear this unit a lot!! I love it one of my favorites out of 26 that I own. It's not a lace front and it doesn't clam to be either but for 15 dollars you can't beat it.<br />The only con is it doesn't have any clips. It does have the adjustable straps though.\n",
      "564->Good Price | 4 | 9 | 10/22/17<br />Very excited about the hair. It took the color well but after a few days it tangled. My suggestion is to not color. It is thick end not thin also not plastic.<br /><br />7/17/18<br />Order not received\n",
      "567->Extremely Overpriced for What You Get and Dubious Claims | 1 | 9 | I am very skeptical regarding the claims made on the box. On the front of the box they claim the cloths are \"designed to reduce fine lines & wrinkles.\" This claim is absolute nonsense. The box also states that the face towel is \"A 100% handmade silk face towel.\". This is false. The underside of the cloth is 50% cotton. They should put this info on the box itself, but they don't. It's misleading and diminishes their credibility.<br /><br />The box claims that this cloth can brighten dull & uneven skin. I am skeptical this cloth has special powers that can do this on its own.<br /><br />Save your money and do not spend so much for just 2 cloths that are not even 100% silk. These cloths do not offer the equivalent value for what is being charged.\n",
      "568->Roller Stand That'll Survive An Apocalypse | 5 | 9 | This display stand appears to be made entirely from one single, solid piece of metal.<br /><br />It's heavy and solid feeling, and will likely outlast at least one, if not more, jade rollers of questionable quality and workmanship, which is apparently the kind I prefer to purchase over the internet.<br /><br />If 2020 keeps going the way it is, I may end up using this thing as a weapon.\n",
      "583->Came off my nail! | 1 | 9 | This stuff is terrible. I applied it, Cured it with UV, and it looked nice for a few hours. Then, I was just running my fingers through my hair and one entire gel came off a nail in one whole piece!  then another came off in the shower two days later. I wasn't even putting pressure on them, and they didn't chip or come off in pieces, just the whole thing just slid off my nail.<br /><br /> It does color change properly, but it is definitely not worth having a gel come off after less than 24 hours. Most good gels last 2 weeks.  I am not unfamiliar with gel polishes; I used to work in cosmetology as a nail technician. I have bought many different brands of gel polishes, including other cheap brands that worked better than this.  Not worth it.\n",
      "585->Cleans your teeth, but open it and find black mold | 2 | 9 | Most of these reviews sound like they were written by Sonicare reps.<br /><br />I've been using Sonicare since they first came out. However, when they first came out they were owned by a small company in Washington that produced a quality product and had excellent customer service.<br /><br />The original company was bought out years ago and the product has gone down hill. I'm sure if you read all the reviews, you will find many that complain about MOLD. My original Sonicare lasted 12 YEARS and never had a drop of mold in it. The next one - etype- I bought began to develop mold immediately.  I wrote to the company, they told me to clean it.  Bull, I'd have to clean it with BLEACH after every brushing. No thanks.<br /><br />Typical of what so often happens when a major corporation wants a monopoly, the product quality slides and the prices go up. I will never buy another Sonicare toothbrush. They gouge you on the price of an inferior product built on a brand name with a huge reputation, then they gouge you on the replacement heads forever after.  Well, I suggest looking around. There are a lot of excellent new ones on the market.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it does a good job cleaning - if you don't mind sticking something in your mouth that has mold over every surface under the brush. And please, don't tell me I don't \"clean it good enough,\" that's corporate crap.\n",
      "588->An interesting combination of scents | 4 | 9 | [[ASIN:B000F5HADA Laura Mercier Almond Coconut Body & Bath Collection Souffle Body Creme 12 oz]] is hands down the best lotion I've ever purchased. As much I love the almond coconut scent, I was looking for a bit of a change.  I read a lot of positive reviews of the amber vanilla scent, and I decided to try it.  While I'm not a huge fan of vanilla (well, I love it as a food, but not so much as a beauty product!), I absolutely love amber-scented products.  As I'm writing this review, I'm sniffing the cream, and trying to find the best way to describe the scent.  It's not difficult to pick out the individual amber and vanilla aromas; it's the combination of the two that I'm having a hard time describing.  As different as the two scents are, they mix well together.  The slightly masculine amber keeps the vanilla from being overly sweet.  I would say that the amber scent is the more pronounced of the two.  This a strong scent; if you're looking for something subtle, you may want to consider another scent.<br /><br />The quality of Laura Mercier's cream is superb.  It's thick, rich, and absorbs well, without any greasiness. As an added bonus, the glass jar is pretty enough to leave out on my bathroom counter.\n",
      "589->Wash it immediately! | 4 | 9 | I used this for henna, it worked very well. It was easier to use, though I suggest building up a muscle or two in your hand if you want to use it over a half an hour, it can cramp your hand. I really like the large array of different tips, I've used about 4 of them so far and each of them work very well.<br /><br />The only bad part is that, when I tried washing them out after every use(cause henna can rot), they were difficult to clean. The wider, fully plastic tips were easier, but some of the tips had to be soaked to get everything out of them, and the lids were difficult to fully clean as well.<br /><br />Overall, good product, fulfilled its use, but a tad challenging to clean.\n",
      "593->They don't do anything different | 2 | 9 | It does not elongate my lashes or make them appear thick; the other reviews were right. It's clumpy and thick. I purchased them specifically to elongate and thicken but... it's just mascara so I can't give it a big rating because it doesn't do what it said...  but it's not the end of the world.<br /><br />Back to searching...\n",
      "595->Perfect for my purse, the office and camping. | 5 | 9 | I straighten my hair daily. This mini straightener is perfect for camping and on the go. I actually got this to keep at the office for emergencies but I'll be taking it with me when I go camping too.<br />Due to the smaller size it takes a little longer to straighten my hair. This isn't ideal for every day use unless you have really short hair, but it works great in a pinch or when you are trying to pack light.<br />It comes with a pretty blue green travel case/bag. It has dual voltage 100-240V and an adapter for worldwide travel.<br />It has 1 heat setting and that's 410°. This worked fine for me because that's the temp my regular straightener is set at.\n",
      "596->I finally found a nice, quality large size clip! | 2 | 9 | I've been happy with this clip.  The spring on my old Goody clip finally bit the dust and finding a quality replacement in a large 5 inches size is quite challenging.  I find that most clips nowadays are made with a brittle type of plastic that when I inevitably drop it on my tile floor, a tooth or two on the clip can easily break off.  This clip seems to be made of the more pliable or soft plastic like my old Goody clip was made of - so drops don't result in a tooth shattering off the clip.  I also really like the low profile of the tabs for your fingers on the back of the clip - they don't protrude nearly as much as on a regular clip and I like that.  I also like the tortoise shell color - it blends in well with my hair color. I was willing to pay for a quality clip that would last and I am happy with this purchase.  I like to have a few around the house for whenever or wherever I need them (cooking in the kitchen, in the bathroom for brushing teeth/washing face, in my suitcase, etc.)  I will definitely be buying a couple more.<br /><br />UPDATE: July 2019 - I still really like this clip and use one every day (I own several) however I've now had two break within a couple of months of purchase.  One was at 3 months and one at 8 months. I can't remember what broke on the first one but this last one the spring didn't break - it was the plastic that holds the spring that twisted and will no longer hold the spring (see photo.)  I love these clips because I have very long hair and they do hold my hair, but at $10 each I wish they lasted longer than 3 or 8 months.  I had a Goody clip that lasted at least 15 years before it finally failed (spring broke) - too bad Goody no longer sells the super large clips.  3 stars off for the poor durability of this product.\n",
      "599->Stick with smaller ponytails/pigtails. | 3 | 9 | Well...here's a breakdown of my review<br />Star 1 - they arrived on time<br />Star 2 - they arrived, as pictured<br />Star 3 - great price<br />Lost 2 stars because they pop a little too easy to me....which kinda messes up the purpose of purchasing them.<br />Obviously, stretching them too much will cause them to pop, however, I've been doing been doing my daughters hair for some years now and I've mastered the ability of putting on hair bows, barrettes and twistees. These should NOT be popping as easy as they are. The elastic bands are a bit smaller than expected, although the balls are correct in size....just how I imagined.\n",
      "602->Been obsessed with gels 💅🏻 | 5 | 9 | I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish.<br />It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change.<br />I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!\n",
      "603->Poor quality | 2 | 9 | I have to say, the color of these brushes is beautiful and my fave shade of purple. However, the product itself is cheap. There are TONS of companies branding this style of detangling brush and at first glance, they all look the same. I promise they are not all made equal. This one in particular has an all plastic handle that comes apart at the seams. Whereas, others of better quality, are made with more of a rectangular handle equipped with rubber in the middle to allow for more grip when detangling. Not to mention, the logo of this company, Messen, started to fade after the first use.<br /><br />I was very disappointed...\n",
      "607->Check before buying from this seller - 1 month shipping - read all of AccessCube Reviews! | 3 | 9 | I am extremely disappointed in this seller. They state no where on their page that it will take an extremely long time for shipment. As the seller AccessCube quoted in an email to me, \"i always buy things from china and sometimes it takes more than 2 months to deliver\" If i ever do receive my product i will update this Review. I didn't read all of the reviews on this seller before purchase, so please don't do what i did! - Please read AccessCube reviews before purchase and beware.<br />I did finally receive this pin almost exactly 1 month from the date of ordering - the pin was nice, so I've upgraded my review to 3 stars (from 1) The product provided is good quality, if you don,t mind waiting for it.\n",
      "610->Beautiful but not what I expected. | 3 | 9 | The hair is really beautiful but it did not meet my expectations. It smelled HORRIBLE out of the package. The shedding was minimal and the wefts are well made but there were multiple colored strings coming from the weft of the hair.<br /><br />The curl is very loose and curly at the top and more coily at the bottom. I have 4a-b hair and this does not blend all that well with my natural hair. This hair is fine and silky textured at the top but the bottom and to be more course/kinky.<br /><br />It held up well to hair dye. I used Revlon Color Silk boxed dye to darken the hair to black and the curl pattern remained. I ordered the 16, 18, 20in. and made a upart wig and only used two bundles; 20 inch on the bottom, 18in in the middle and top. I will use the leftover bundle to make clip-ins or a ponytail.<br /><br />If you have courser textured hair, it may be a good idea to go with Afro Kinky Curly not this regular curly/kinky curly.\n",
      "613->About what I expected. | 4 | 9 | I was looking for a light weight inexpensive cap. This looked about like the others I have had for 3+ years now.<br />Its the same size as any other standard one.<br />Its has a Velcro neck.<br />It washes just fine.<br />The negative star is for the fact that the Velcro snags the cap occasionally.<br />This one probably wont last as long as the last, but the last was $15 dollars, and from a supply store. Since this was less then half the price its still great.\n",
      "616->Pick up some better clips to hold the ears on; otherwise very nice! | 4 | 9 | Ears do not stay in at all with those clips. Kinda weird how high quality they are and yet they have the worst pins ever haha. I used some clear hair clamps to pin them in and that worked to keep them in one spot with my hair pulled back.<br /><br />The tail is HUGE even at the smallest length. The fur itself is short but the tail body is very long and wide. Not very wolffish but makes a cute grey fox.<br /><br />Overall great if you want a low-cost tail and ears that look more expensive. Not good for a werewolf costume probably.\n",
      "625->cons far outweigh the pros | 1 | 9 | The glowing reviews about this product are accurate in a sense - yes, this product shows a noticeable improvement in the appearance of skin over a short period of time.  It does contain enough glycolic acid at a decent ph, it does exfoliate well.  Whatever praises people bestow are germane but only to a certain degree.  The fact of the matter though is that the entire line of products contain many unefficacious artificial ingredients at best and downright harmful toxins, in effect, at worst.<br /><br />It has plenty of potential but does not deliver.  It seems to me that the makers are not truly interested in answering the riddle to great skin.  It is a start devoid of middle or end notes.  It does not cater to the skin as a complete system.  It will give you a minor improvement and waste a lot of your time.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.  If you love it and are happy good for you.  I will not throw cigarette buds on anyones Eden.  If however you are not a believer like me and want to try another alternative try something with ONLY natural ingredients.  Anything else and your skin will be in a constant battle with adversaries you put there, everyday, and leave there to do damage, because it's absurd to think that the body could assimilate such artificiality in any positive long-term way.<br /><br />The choice is yours my friends.\n",
      "626->This is not authentic Carols Daughter Product. | 1 | 9 | This is not authentic Carols Daughter Product at least the one I got wasn’t. As soon as I got it I noticed there wasn’t any security seal. The smell is just  the worst thing you could ever imagine, like baby powder x cheap perfume, so bad my head is pounding hours later. I got this because I’ve used carols daughter before and always wanted to try this almond leave in. I’m 99.9% sure this bottle didn’t contain not one drop of almond anything.<br />I was able to get a full refund and plan on tossing this bottle into the abyss and going to the store to buy an actual bottle of carols daughter.\n",
      "630->received old, previously opened/used product | 1 | 9 | do not buy. this is one of my staple products that i normally purchased from sephora, but they no longer sell this brand. i’ve purchased a smaller bottle from amazon in the past & it was great. but this larger bottle did not have the plastic seal around the edges ensuring that it was new, and when i opened it there was dried, crusty, sticky, old product caked around the edges of the bottle and on the inside too. it has clearly been opened and probably even used before being sent to me. not worth it, buy directly from the farsali site. reviewing the legitimate product (not from amazon or this seller), 10/10 stuff. just don’t buy it here.<br /><br />**update: sellers were very kind and understanding & the return was very smooth\n",
      "635->This soap really works, but you must use it daily. | 5 | 9 | I developed acne on my back after my daughter was born, and this is the only soap that calms and soothes the breakouts without drying my skin. It has an almost unnoticeable light scent, even my extremely scent sensitive mother likes it. I stopped purchasing it when a tavern was built next to my local health food store making parking on the weekends impossible. This was a huge mistake because other soaps were either too drying or encouraged more breakouts.<br />It is so nice to find this soap on Amazon, as it saves me the inconvenience of trying to navigate my crowded local health food store on a Sunday. It arrived nicely packed, undamaged and as a bonus, the twelve pack came with a lovely wood soap dish unmentioned in the description; though it is shown in the pictures.\n",
      "637->WOW | 5 | 8 | *EDIT: I continue to be wowed by this wig. I ordered another one in case I messed this one up and then went ahead and straightened this one with a flat iron. I cut the lace, used a wig band and it's not even glued down. Still love it, maybe even more now!*<br /><br />To say I'm pleased would be an understatement. I've been looking for a wig that matches my hair color!! My biggest complaint is that I have a round face so I NEED bangs or fringe or something. A hairline on a non-lacefront makes me look even ROUNDER and that's not the look I'm going for! Most wigs require a lot of trimming and shaping to give me the look I want.<br /><br />I love long hair but not every day. So ... i thought I'd try this baby. Not only is the hairline beautiful but the color is perfect, the weight is amazing and the length is just right ... not too long like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out. If anything, I might try to give it more volume because i love big hair but ... a few bobby pins, a wide-tooth comb and I'm SET.<br /><br />This wig is beautiful. I've included a picture of my real hair for reference. I've never given a wig such a glowing review but this is literally plug and play and, for me, that makes all the difference!\n",
      "641->My wife swears by this stuff and she's beautiful! | 5 | 8 | Apparently this stuff is great for her pores and firms up her skin so she looks like she's still in high school. I just nod and smile because that's what a husband does.<br /><br />The stuff we got was real. We ordered it a few times, until we discovered that the company delivers it as well and you can get three 60ml bottles including shipping for $32. At about $11 a bottle, that's cheaper than the 30ml being sold here. I think it's probably reseller on here so you pay for the convenience.<br /><br />Anyway, it's good stuff and worth a try.\n",
      "644->Yes the Hair Grip Works | 5 | 8 | I first saw this concept, Grip wrap for Wigs on Youtube. I searching on Amazon, I found many different makers, sellers.<br />I chose this one by the embroidered Logo (on the side) hoping for quality. They all resemble each other, quality didn't appear to be<br />the same, as you can find many of these for sale, names vary.<br /><br />My (Brown) Hair Grip arrived today. I have tried it with two different Wigs.<br />1. Outre Dominican Blow Out Color #2  Half Wig with back and front combs and adjustable strap<br />2. FreeTress Equal Evyln lace front in Taffy. 2 side temple combs, back comb and adjustable strap<br /><br />1. Outre: I did not need to use the front comb at all. I did apply the back comb, it's not necessary though.<br />I did it out of habit. The Half Wig is in it's natural place, snug, it's moveable yes, it's not going anywhere,<br />The Grip actually makes the wig look more natural upon my head, it pulls it inward as natural hair looks.<br /><br />The Hair Grip wrap works as intended, no combs required to keep the wig in place, snug.<br /><br />2. FreeTress Evyln Color Taffy. I did not use either side temple combs.<br />The Hair Grip I chose is dark brown.<br /><br />Taffy Evyln is a dark root, darkest brown, blonde ombre,<br />if you really stare hard you can slightly see the grip/wrap in the part.<br />You would have to know it's there to detect it. I do not believe anyone would see it outright.<br /><br />Again same result, The Hair Grip works as intended. The wig fit is snug, no way is it coming off.<br />Whatever the magic is with this The Hair Grip, it does enhance the actual fit of your wig in the positive.<br /><br />I am glad I chose the Dark Brown Hair Grip vs the Beige, the Black, my natural hair is Darkest Brunette.<br />The brown color for me will be the most versatile for longevity of use and wear.<br /><br />The actual fabric is very light, it's nearly weightless, it is not a velvet material.<br />The Velcro is soft to touch. I do not foresee it damaging my wig interiors, nor the hair either.<br /><br />The Hair Grip is Firm &#34; in place&#34; there is not a feeling that I am wearing a headband..<br />No ring around the head feel. It's adjustable too, you can lighten or pull tighter, the velcro is ample.<br />The attach part of Velcro is about 2 inches, the connect side of the Velcro is several inches, this<br />will fit all heads, I can't see how it wouldnt.<br /><br />Remember if you are wearing &#34; wide' part lace fronts,<br />Color will come into play, the Grip is going to be visible depending on Wig color nearest the part.<br /><br />I hope my review helps out, as it's a bit confusing with so many nearly same, yet not alike.<br /><br /> I am satisfied with my purchase, it is a worthy investment.\n",
      "662->Not for red heads | 3 | 8 | I probably would have liked this product more if it came in a shade for red hair. This shade was listed as recommended for red, but left an ashy finish, even after a lot of blending. You could just see the color, I think.<br /><br />That being said, the customer service was A++ on returning the product and I will be trying other items from this seller in the future.\n",
      "666->Beautiful | 5 | 8 | Very pleased with this purchase.  Out of all of these there 8s only one I wouldn't wear because its to big/wide. It covers the top of my whole head. Photo included. The beads are sewn on which really helps with quality. Out of all of them I only found one with an imperfection. The bead is not sewn all the way and it sticks up some.<br />These are beautiful and I am very happy I bought these.\n",
      "668->Makes my feet tingle | 4 | 8 | Pumice stone (made in Korea)<br />It's a regular pumice stone; if you've seen one, you've seen them all. This one fits in the hand nicely and has a pleasant minty scent. I admit I've never found these very useful, and probably won't use it much because they're hard to clean. The one I received is smoother and a different shape from the one in the picture.<br /><br />Wooden foot massager (made in China)<br />I used to have a similar one and lost it, so this was one of the reasons I bought the kit. I like this a lot because the ridges are not as deep/pointed as they are on some rollers. It's relaxing without being painful, and feels great on the sides of the feet too. I even like rolling it between my hands. My only complaint is that the wood is a tiny bit rough in places. Not anything I feel when using it, however.<br /><br />Wooden foot brush (made in China)<br />I was disappointed in this brush because the one I received has flaws in the wood that make it look grimy. If I were buying this set in a shop, I would have looked through them all and picked one without a damaged brush. However, it's still functional and the bristles are a nice balance between stiff and soft. You can use it to clean your toenails or simply brush it on your feet to get the blood circulating.<br /><br />Tea tree oil foot scrub (made in the USA)<br />This is really nice, it has a fine grit that works well without irritating. You get a full size tube and don't use a lot at a time, so this will last a while.<br /><br />Tea tree oil foot balm (made in the USA)<br />This is the star of the show, it's heavenly. Smells refreshingly minty, makes your skin soft. Works on any dry skin, not just feet. I couldn't resist using a lot of this, so even though you get a lot, I have a feeling I'll be buying more fairly soon. I really notice the difference right away. I can easily see this becoming a must-have staple.<br /><br />Bag<br />It comes in a plastic bag with a green cord drawstring. The plastic is thick enough to make it reusable, though the foot massager sticks out the top. It's nothing special, but sturdy enough to store the set.<br /><br />Overall<br />All together, the kit is very relaxing to use after a stressful day. I'm definitely going to check out more of the Earth Therapeutics products that are made in the USA.<br /><br />The balm and scrub are both vegan, however the brush has boar bristles, so this would NOT be a good gift for a vegan. However, it would be a great unisex gift for just about anyone else, especially people who are on their feet all day.\n",
      "676->I have fine hair but a lot of it | 3 | 8 | I’ve had numerous extensions in my life. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Bellami volumizing weft, which is expensive (definitely an investment). I have fine hair but a lot of it. The problem I have with many extension companies is blending the extensions with my own hair, since most of them are so thin my hair peaks through. I also have shoulder length hair, which adds another level of difficulty when trying to blend extensions.<br /><br />Pros<br />• The hair is soft<br />• The hair doesn’t tangle easily<br />• The color is nice<br />• The clips are amazing. Once I clip them in they stay.<br />• They are convenient. One weft and you’re done (usually)<br />• They are cheap, and a good quality for the price<br />• Good starting off extensions<br /><br />Cons<br />• The hair is thin; it is heavier on top and thins out to a v-point. As expected my hair peaked though. I ended up tying up my bottom layer and  putting the extensions on top. It solved the problem of the hair poking though.<br />• For these extensions to work for me I would need to buy at least two more packs of hair. Having 3, five clip wefts wouldn’t fit around my head comfortably.<br />• These will not give you volume; they are too thin to give you any thickness<br />• If you have a lot of hair these will not look very natural<br /><br />This hair is best suited for someone with thin, medium length hair who is looking for some length. Also, if you have layers in your hair it could help blend the hair. I got my own hair thinned out a little at the hair salon and it made a huge difference.<br /><br />This hair will not work well with short hair or thick hair unless you are willing to work hard to blend it.<br /><br />I will be buying one more weft in order to see how that works out for me. I will update this post once I receive my new weft.<br /><br />My experience wearing 2- five clip wefts\n",
      "686->The best! | 5 | 8 | We've tried so many conditioners to keep the long silky hair of our Havanese nice and healthy and free of mats. We found this cream about 6 months ago and it has done an incredible job! It smells great and feels just right (not too greasy). Also, our dog has sensitive skin. He develops little itchy spots with many products. This conditioner does not irritate his skin. His hair (yes, Havanese have hair instead of fur) looks amazing for the longest time. I can't recommend it enough! Love it.<br /><br />Update after a year of using the product regularly: We are still extremely happy and pleased with this product. Our dog is not a puppy anymore and his hair has gotten thicker. This conditioner cream keeps his hair nice and healthy. His hair looks very silky and shiny but never greasy. I love the smell of this conditioner. Also, a little bit goes a long ways so it ends up being pretty affordable in the long run.\n",
      "696->Robot in disguise? | 2 | 8 | At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as \"Frenzy\" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007\n",
      "700->Why It Will Not Last As Long As your Old Oral-B | 4 | 8 | I was puzzled by all the complaints about the short life of the Oral-B 800 Series toothbrushes because my five-year-old Oral-B was still going strong. I ordered a new 8850 DLX anyway, because the gasket between the body and replaceable head that prevents liquid from leaking into the interior of the body had finally deteriorated and I figured that it was just a matter of time till the moisture caused the motor and electronics to fail. When the 8850 DLX  arrived, the reason for the short life span was obvious. The head and body design was the same as my old one, but the gasket has been eliminated!! I guess it makes sense from a business standpoint as they have probably doubled their business by decreasing the replacement time from 5 years to 2 years.<br />From a performance standpoint, it is still a great toothbrush and I would not use anything else. It's a must have for anyone with sensitive gums who is using Sensodine toothpaste to mask the pain. It completely eliminated the sensitivity of my gums and has changed my dentist's assessment from \"disaster area\" to \"wish mine were that healthy\". I find that it works a lot better with gel toothpaste than regular.\n",
      "707->It seems to work fine. My only complaint is that it came defective | 3 | 8 | Well. It seems to work fine. My only complaint is that it came defective. The top lid sticks out when I try to apply it... 3 stars only.<br />****UPDATE*****<br />I contacted the seller regarding the above issue, and they were very efficient. They replied within hours, and also issued a refund. Even though the lipstick came broken, they have good customer service.\n",
      "713->not bad | 4 | 8 | The wig is for my daughter's Halloween costume (011 from Stranger Things). It will suit the purpose. It's quite pretty and the hair is soft and sleek.<br /><br />It came well packaged with a hair net wig cap.<br /><br />The &#34;bangs&#34; are not that great since you can see the stitching and you can also see the stitching on the back of the wig, as well as my daughter's dark hair underneath.<br /><br />It is way better than any wig you'll find at a costume store (you know the kind - brassy, plastic,shiny strands that fall apart as soon as you touch it)\n",
      "718->Works for Eye Puffiness & Amazing Off-Label Headache Relief!! | 5 | 8 | This eye cream was far different than I was expecting -- but in a GREAT way. I'm 29-years-old, so the lines around my eyes aren't terribly deep, although they are probably deeper than many other females my age due to my sun-worshiping in earlier years. I do suffer, however, from severe seasonal allergies and am constantly plagued with dark circles (&#34;allergic shiners&#34; as they call them) and extreme puffiness of both my upper eyelids and just under my eyes (the infamous &#34;bags&#34;).<br /><br />To be honest, my impression of this cream at first glance wasn't too great. For starters, the jar of cream was much smaller than I had imagined, but I guess that's my fault for not noticing the (very) small-printed &#34;0.5 fl oz&#34; on the label in the picture. (I do think that this was a little deceitful though, because the size/amount of this cream is not listed anywhere on the product description.) In addition, while trying to read the teeny tiny print on the jar, I also almost immediately noticed a spelling typo on the front of the label that reads &#34;Nautral & Healthy&#34; rather than &#34;Natural & Healthy.&#34; I know this seems like a rather minuscule and knit-picky detail to point out, but it did make me at least wonder about this company's quality control standards.<br /><br />Despite my initial impression, I gave the company/cream the benefit of the doubt and have been using it for the last few days. With my first application under my eyes, the cream felt more on the &#34;thin&#34; side (similar to a lotion rather than thick cream), but while rubbing the cream into my skin in a circular motion, the moisture that the cream delivered was far better than I anticipated. It takes at least 3-4 minutes before your skin feels like the cream is completely absorbed, which gave me ample time to slowly massage the area during absorption (and felt very soothing and relaxing). I had absolutely no issues with any side effects or skin reactions such as burning, tingling, redness, or irritation. I noticed a small &#34;immediate&#34; reduction in the pores and fine lines of the areas I applied the cream, though not as impressive as some of the Retinol and Vitamin C serums that I've used in the past. There was no obvious difference in the dark circles or puffiness right after application, however, within about 30-45min, the puffiness started to visibly decrease and the area all around my eyes felt less tender/achy in general.<br /><br />With each subsequent application, I noticed the same resulting decrease in puffiness as was observed initially. My puffiness did return each morning, but I expected because I'm still constantly being exposed to my allergens. (After all, the cream is meant to relieve a symptom of my allergies, not be a miracle cure for my chronic systemic condition.) I've noticed that if I apply the cream immediately before bed and spend more time rubbing it into my skin in the circular motions, I do have a noticeable decrease in the morning when I wake up compared to before I started using the cream. As far as the under-eye dark circles, I can't tell a difference so far - but in all fairness, I've only been using the cream for 4 days (twice daily) so there's still hope.<br /><br />Now for the best part (in my opinion, at least). On the second night of using this cream, I had yet another one of my throbbing headaches (allergies are the worst!!) About 15-20min after my evening cream application, I noticed that my headache felt a little better -- I'm not saying that there was some miraculous change here, but it did feel less severe. This was very unusual for me, as I hadn't taken any ibuprofen or Zyrtec at that point (my usual go-to medications when my headaches are severe). The only thing I could think that I had done differently this time than any other time was that I applied the cream -- it was a strange connection, but stranger things have certainly happened to me. I went back to look at the ingredients listed on the jar and saw that it had rooibos in it. I had absolutely no idea what this was (and probably didn't notice it the first time I looked because I don't have a magnifying glass), but I looked it up online and read that it's an herb from South Africa with a laundry-list of health benefits -- including antioxidant properties and... headache relief?!?! Although still relatively skeptical that this was just a coincidence and that I had gotten &#34;lucky&#34; on my google search, I was still optimistic and proceeded to rub the eye cream on my temples and at the base of my skull to see what would happen. After a good 30-45min, my headache was almost completely gone. I know this headache thing sounds ridiculous and obscure, but I encourage anyone to research this mysterious Rooibos for themselves. I haven't had a headache as severe as that one since, but I have had a few headaches start to come on, and with each headache, I applied the cream to my temples, under my eyes, and to the base of my skull and the feeling has gone away each time within about an hour.<br /><br />With all of this said, I couldn't rate this &#34;eye&#34; cream turned headache remedy anything less than 5 stars despite my initial less-than-thrilled first impression. Because the cream is light and only requires a very small amount with each application, I think the small jar will actually last me a reasonably long time, too. Between the headache relief and the disappearing eye bags, I would be confident in recommending this product to others. I was also fortunate to receive my first jar of this cream at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "719->Regular 'ol conditioner and my hair has been getting frizzy... | 2 | 8 | This conditioner is just meh for me. I was excited because it is full of natural oils but there are no ingredients on the bottle, which is suspect. I have been using it for a few weeks with a marked decrease in the smoothness of my hair and increased frizziness. It works about as well as regular cheap store conditioner, but it definitely doesn't perform like high end conditioner, or even Pantene. I will probably finish up this bottle because I don't like to waste things, but I wouldn't buy this again and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. The good thing about it is that it smells nice and it comes in a very big pump dispenser. If I could be more confident in the ingredients I would feel more comfortable with this product in general.<br /><br />I got this conditioner for free in order to try it out and review it. This is obviously my honest opinion, I didn't care for it much.\n",
      "722->Doesn't work as promoted! | 1 | 8 | Once again Amazon won't post my review!  Reason: They claim my review is FALSE & the product is authentic.  Hmmm below is my original review:  It says NOTHING about this product not being \"AUTHENTIC\".<br />HEY AMAZON, the review is ACCURATE because it talks about HOW THE PRODUCT is SHOWN to work & it doesn't deliver! People NEED TO KNOW THAT! This product's Video SHOWS hair that is SMOOTH & SILKY SHINY!  That is the PROMISE!  IT DOESN'T DO THAT!<br />Not sure why my last review was removed, but it IS 100% honest and accurate!  This product doesn't work AS PROMOTED!  I've got LONG hair that is long enough to sit on, keep it well cared for.  The video shows \"silky smooth & super shiny\" hair after using this product.  I've used the entire jar now (that's 4 treatments by the way for hair like mine) and though yes my hair IS soft (but it ALWAYS has been) its' over all look & condition has NOT changed at all!  I was hoping for the silky soft shiny hair shown in the video as I have very curly hair (not looking for STRAIGHT hair, just SMOOTH & SHINY) & it doesn't work!  Over all I would give this product no more then 2 stars since it does smell good, and does leave your hair soft, but so does every other bottled conditioner out there.\n",

It goes away after a couple minutes. but I'd never had one to be sticky feeling before.  Very odd!\n",

      "735->Terrible Service, Mediocre Products. | 1 | 8 | My wife and I purchased a total of 6 creams, 3 each, one of each kind; eye, face, and cellulite. The creams were making my wife's skin flaky, while causing a rash on my skin. I was a little worried at first, because we had tried other creams with undesirable effects, but this company offered a 90 day, 100% No Risk Full Refund, and would not require us to ship the product back.<br /><br />I thought it was worth a shot. If it worked, great, if not, we have nothing to lose, which is what they want you to believe. They want you to think that they believe in the effectiveness of their product with such confidence that they will let you try it, and if it does not work, they will give you your money back without hassle.<br /><br />This was not the case. I sent 3 emails requesting my refund. Each time they repeated the same thing; I would have to ship the unused portion back, and then they would issue a refund.<br /><br />Here is what they advertised above, &#34;100% No Risk Money Back Guarantee...If you are unhappy with the item, we will issue you a 100% refund of your purchase price within 90 days, and you may keep the unused contents of the skin cream.&#34; Andre Lorent<br /><br />I would not buy creams or any other products from Andre Lorent.\n",
      "739->Minimalist, clean, satisfying, stays beautifully, cleans easily &lt;3 | 5 | 8 | I absolutely love this. I’ve used it every day for a while now. I tried the tiny brush it came with and decided it’s not the best tool for me. (I stabbed myself in the eye way too frequently). Now I use an angle brush for eyeliner wingtips and for brow filling and a cute barrel brush for my eyelashes.<br />Before I got this, I was accustomed to wiping mascara flakes off my under eyes all afternoon, and I never have to do that anymore. I love how simple and subtle this cake is, and I love getting to clean and reuse a nice mascara brush and avoid goopy messes and disposable plastic bottles. Also, cleanup is super easy (from brushes and face).  I will absolutely be ordering refills when I finish it.\n",

I think its unique and awesome that the company who makes these have specialized in sharpening services for a long time. It definitely shows! They are well made, they are well weighted and the little jewel is a cute accent to the shears. I took the time to make a video to really break down all the pros and cons of these shears, so please take a moment to watch if you'd like an extensive review!<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free, in exchange for an honest review.

      "743->Difficult to work with | 2 | 8 | I’ve been really into gel blushes lately and I kept seeing this pop up in my feeds, so I gave in and bought it.<br /><br />For the price you do get a lot of product. It’s quite large and it’s probably going to last a lifetime BECAUSE it is SO pigmented. Seriously, its almost too pigmented. You literally only need a pin sized amount because it’s so pigmented. Its difficult to control how much comes out because when you squeeze it.<br /><br />It’s hard to get this blended in before it started staining and setting. It’s hard to control the pigment and every time I’ve tried it I end up going to low with it in order to get the edges blended out.<br /><br />Frankly, I prefer Maybelline Cheek Heat over this product. It’s much more sheer and easier to work with and I like the dried down finish of it better because it’s a bit dewier than this product.<br /><br />For the price I wish I liked it more.\n",

      "757->Bristles start breaking off within a month of usage. | 1 | 7 | Edited 5/13/2016:<br /><br />I've used this product for years and it worked great with longer bristles.  It always had a tendency for the bristles to get brittle due to the heat of the curling iron,, and then the bristles break off very easily.  The last two I purchased, the bristles starting breaking off within a month of usage.  It used to take several months of use for this to happen.  The plastic you are using on the bristles is defective.  Please remedy this.<br /><br />They recently shortened the bristles and it makes it easy to burn your hand because of this.  Please make the bristles longer.  Also, they bristles become weak due to heat and start to break.  Please make the bristles out of better material.<br /><br />To Helen of Troy:  If you could make it get hotter, and make it heat up quickly, and make the bristles longer like they were before, and make the bristles last longer before getting brittle and breaking off , I would give it 5 stars.\n",

      "764->Your hair with withstand gale force winds! :) | 5 | 7 | I've tried many products for &#34;extreme&#34; hairstyles like liberty spikes and nothing comes close to the performance of Got2b Glued Blasting Freeze Spray. I've now used it exclusively for over 3 years and purchase it in multi-packs for team events.<br /><br />I've spiked hair as long as 18-24 inches and, if you can find a creative way to sleep with your hair spiked so high, your style will last a few days, even if you're dancing in the wind.<br /><br />Tips for use: Brush or comb hair. Depending on the desired style, it's often helpful to part hair into segments for spikes and using coated hair ties to keep the segments apart.  Apply spray to clean, dry hair.  Spray  Got2b Glued liberally (your hair should feel wet) first to the roots in small segments and dry with a hair dryer on a cool setting to establish the &#34;base&#34; of your style. Use your hands to shape it as your dry. (For some of the longer hair, it can become a  four-hand task, so get some assistance from a friend.) Once your shape is set, spray to the tips of your hair in small segments  and dry each segment before doing the next. When you've spiked all segments, give your entire style one more heavy coating and dry with the dryer.  For liberty spikes or other styles where you want the tips to stay tidy, apply a small amount of Got2b Ultra Glued Invisible Styling Gel (smile.amazon.com/Got2b-Ultra-Invincible-Styling-6-Ounce/dp/B004FQK7DA/) to the tips only and dry once more with the dryer.<br /><br />Clean-up is also easy. Use a gentle shampoo and warm water.\n",
      "768->Shower Wear That's Fun To Wear | 4 | 7 | This adorable waterproof shower caps can hold a lot of hair and still look beautiful. We tend to not use shower caps because we never find one big enough to hold all our hair. My daughter and I both have a ton of hair and never find one that allows us to stuff all our hair into without some of it sticking out the side.<br /><br />We think the Eslite waterproof shower cap is the first one that fits the hair, plus isn't itchy. I thought it would be because of the lace around the face but oddly enough it wasn't.<br /><br />The blue and the bling makes it worth wearing. We don't feel like old ladies when wearing it. No more straightening our hair during the day just to get it wet on a nightly shower which always frizzes it up again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion. My reviews are 100% honest and true based on my personal opinion not on a company’s description or request. No monetary compensation was offered or received.\n",
      "769->Getting the wrong color poses an inconvenience. | 4 | 7 | It's a solid wide tooth comb. Sturdy enough to help me comb through tangles in the shower but not so rigid that it hurts. I ordered this after my last wide tooth comb broke when i dropped it in the shower. Dropped this one, it didn't break.<br /><br />Big con... I ordered the minty green comb. Like others, i received a white comb. I wear glasses/contacts but usually haven't put my contacts in before I shower in the morning. Dropped the comb and it disappeared. The white blends in the shower floor and my counter top. Not ideal and would not be a problem if I'd received the color ordered.\n",
      "772->Great but, get the cheaper one. Just as good. | 2 | 7 | Do you have migraines or Meniere's disease or just have a sensitive head? Don't get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes. They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.<br /><br />I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years. A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company. Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model. Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly, over stylized, blue body.<br /><br />When the battery started to die on my classic model, I picked up a pulsating Oral B. It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging. But it vibrates your jaw and skull like, well, a vibrating electric tooth brush! After a month, it was just too much for me. I went back to the dieing battery original, but soon got its replacement as a gift.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm in my 40s and I've had about 6 different dentists (moving from job to job) in 5 different states. One was a professor at a dental college. After each visit, they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape. I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush (non pulsating) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total. I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time. I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.<br /><br />Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush. I think it is on sale sometimes for about $10.\n",
      "774->Remover is awesome but glue is not waterproof | 4 | 7 | My rating is for the remover not the glue-my travel size tube came almost empty, didn't have enough for 2 layers for a 4x4 frontal. I sent a message asking for a replacement tube but didn't get an email back. I followed all the directions but it smelled and looked like Elmer's glue to me but The glue was great until I washed my hair 2 days later. after that it turned white again and became a gooy mess that never set back up even after my hair dried completely. I have yet to find a clear glue that will survive a shower which is frustrating.<br /><br />Update: the glue sucks but the remover is amazing, removes all different types of glues and it's super easy to wash out of my bio hair.\n",
      "785->Rots nails! DO NOT USE!!!! | 1 | 7 | My wife had been using this product for a few months straight in combination with a top coat gel she started noticing that are fingernails hurt if she did not have the Polish on so I urged her to clean it off and what we found underneath the nail was mind blowing.... the nails had become dark brown and extremely brittle just the slightest touch and they would snap off.... I'm not sure what kind of freaky chemicals are inside this nail polish but whatever it is, is extremely volatile<br /><br />Her entire toenail straight died and the entire thing peel off in a chunk I would not under any circumstances use this product I can't believe that it's even legal to sell it when it causes issues like that crazy stuff!!\n",

I took the boxes out in one photo to show the room available if you need it.<br /><br />On one side you have a smaller zippered comparment which has a thermal lined pocket inside which can hold hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons, and also allows for storage of extra items such as brushes and combs, or miscellaneous items.<br /><br />On the other side there is another zippered compartment which allows for more products, plus has an netted portion which opens to the outside to allow for tissues to be dispensed quickly and easily. There are slots in this pocket also which allow for small tools like scissors, combs , brushes, etc to be stored.<br /><br />the top handle is sturdy and has a nice grip that's easy to hold on to and carry around.<br /><br />I stored my blow dryer and some brushes in the top compartment, straightener in the side compartment, tissues in the other side, and filled all three boxes with makeup products, and then still had plenty of room left.<br /><br />All compartments are extremely easy access, whether holding the backpack with one arm and grabbing something out, or sitting it on a table or chair and unzipping with one hand. I love that the front compartment is velcroed so that once unzipped, it's still easy to close quickly and will keep everything secure until you have time to zip back up.<br /><br />This is fantastic whether you are a makeup artist heading to a show, or just a glamorous girl with lots of products on the go travelling.<br />Even at home this makes for great storage and easy accessibility.<br /><br />FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Product provided for my inspection and review, all thoughts and opinions are my own\n",
      "799->Strong and Beautiful | 4 | 7 | I'm blown away by how this product was able to hold up to the abuse I put it through, as a martial artist.  Plus, it's healthier for my nails.<br /><br />Advantages:<br />-Great for nail health.<br />-Amazingly durable.<br />-Short drying time.<br />-Gorgeous color (if you take time to mix a couple of shades together) with a nice shine.<br />-Dr.'s Remedy nail polish remover works surprisingly well, and requires very little to do the job.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />-Very expensive. ...very expensive. Minus one star for extremely high price.<br />-Colors aren't exactly what I want, so I had to buy several shades and mix them to get a nice color. (yet another blow to my wallet.)<br /><br />The drying time for this polish is short and durability is incredible. I am able to kick targets with my beautifully painted toenails about 45 minutes after applying all of these coats. The only other brand that has held up to this kind of abuse that I've tried is Sally Hansen, but Sally Hansen is not as good for nail health and required at least a day of curing time before kicking targets, plus it would rub off on the targets. Dr.'s Remedy doesn't rub off.<br /><br />I use the base coat, then nail color, then top coat...yes, at around $17 per bottle, it was a ton of money to spend on something I was uncertain of.<br /><br />I remove this polish after a week, and allow at least a day of rest for my nails.\n",
      "801->Beautiful Wig One of My Favorites | 5 | 7 | [[VIDEOID:38f0c432b6ecc50d8de2d1e965499647]] I love this wig, this is one of my favorite synthetic wigs. I think it got tangled in the package and probably had something to do with the tag being hung up. I am new at wearing wigs, but trying to get comfortable wearing before I start spending a lot of money.<br /><br />I do not have any experience in baby hairs etc. and I am not gluing the wigs as I want to be able to take them off at the end of the day, event etc.<br /><br />This wig is very pretty looks natural and once I got the tangles out and removed the lace it was super cute!<br />great price, not heavy at all. I love it.\n",
      "804->Works great until the charger burns out | 2 | 7 | I have now owned two different Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes with the same charging base. The first one stopped charging after about 6 months, and this one, which I only ordered because it was Black Friday and the price was 29.99 (and I thought a higher quality version from Oral-B would have a better charging base), burned out after less than 3 months. I keep the charger away from all water sources and thoroughly dry the toothbrush handle before putting it back on the charger. The base is a cheap piece of plastic and I will not risk ordering this brand again.<br /><br />Amazon customer service was great - I missed the return window by one day, and because the item was defective they allowed me to return it for a 100% refund. I don't know what toothbrush I'll try next, but I will order it from Amazon again.\n",
      "815->Far to rough on the skin. | 2 | 7 | The white bag is made from a scratchy plastic mesh. It was like using sand paper and was far too rough for me.<br />I also own the black and blue soap savers and those are made from a different material that is perfect.\n",
      "820->Nice quality, good fit and great price! | 4 | 7 | This are great. Was looking for a small thin headband that would hold down my new curly thick hair after chemo. The colors are great and the fabric is nicely wrapped on each one. They aren’t too tight but don’t slip off.  I did receive them with some of the metal teeth bent but that was probably because they stacked them all together for shipping.  It was an easy fix.  Simply adjust the teeth.  That’s one of the features I like.  Since my scalp is sensitive, I can move the teeth so they don’t touch my scalp but hold my hair.<br /><br />These were not exactly what I was looking for.  But great overall.  My only issue with these which is why they lost a star is that the teeth don’t go all the way don’t toward the ear.  So they don’t hold down the 2-3 inches of the side hair as well as the rest.<br /><br />The price is great...a steal for the amount of bands you get.  All my searching these were the best price for 10.  I am happy they were great!\n",
      "825->The one blade for my OneBlade. | 5 | 7 | I get two shaves from my OneBlade.  I can get a third if desperate, though it begins to pull.  Don’t expect a “cartridge” type overstated lifecycle.  I’ve read where guys use once.  Now that’s opulent.<br /><br />37.5 cents per shave.\n",
      "834->It's just ok | 2 | 7 | As typical tempered glass screen protectors go for curved displays, this one also has issues with touch responsiveness on the very corners.  trying to select for caps lock or switch to the numbers pad takes some time. The anti-smudge coating is horrible but It seems to adhere fine and looks good but should only be used for a temp solution until something better comes out. For $10 or so and for the time being, better than nothing.<br />UPDATE: Downgraded to TWO stars because the adheasive is no longer sticking well and there are more \"untouchable\" sections. Don't buy!\n",
      "838->Are They Worth Their Weight In Postage?  NO! | 3 | 7 | These are the studs that you get when getting your ears pierced. They are sterilized (before you open them) stainless steel. They seem to be the only kind that do not irritate my ear lobes. Delivery was faster than a speeding bullet, and they were exactly as described and look really good. But, the shipping and handling price made me gasp. I almost changed my mind.  Since I was ordering 12 pair, I bit the bullet.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I weighed the package on my postal scale. It did not weigh a pound and parcel post cost for one pound was $5.38. My daughter and granddaughters want their birthstones.  I looked to see what this seller's S&H was for one pair of earrings, and they want the same $9.95. Has anyone heard of postage gouging?  If you can afford it, buy them.  My rating is based on the shipping cost.\n",
      "846->Works...when it does | 1 | 7 | The kit includes gel and the rechargeable LED unit. I was able to use it for a few days and then the main LED unit stopped taking a charge and it will no longer turn on. I had to return it.<br /><br />When it works, it made a noticeable difference and did so without any pain or increased sensitivity. Normally my teeth are very sensitive and in the past, other whitening products hurt too much to use. This one was great in that regard...no pain at all.\n",
      "847->Fabulous Flat Iron- IF you can make it work! | 1 | 7 | Flat iron has a \"high tech\" LCD screen with a touch panel.<br />I've had this flat iron for over a month and still can't operate the touch screen correctly without looking at the directions.<br />One day, I was in a hurry and couldn't FIND the directions.  I had just washed my hair and couldn't get the iron on the setting I needed.  So, I had to leave the house without properly doing my hair.<br />THAT was real annoying.<br />So ... minus one star because the touch panel sux.<br /><br />=====================<br />UPDATE:  August 20, 2019<br />DOWNGRADE from 4-stars to 3-stars.<br />I really HATE the touch panel.  It's just bad!<br /><br />UPDATE:  September 22, 2019<br />\"Slide to unlock\" - NOT !<br />Touch Panel not working, so I can't turn ON the flat iron.<br />I've had it with this POS!<br />Downgrade!<br />NO STARS!\n",

      "858->Seems to be working. Sensitive skins beware | 3 | 7 | Seems good, with caveats. I've only been using it for a week. Got it at a trade show.  I've always had extremely dry,  sensitive,  allergic skin.  The pushy  sales person wanted to put it on my face.  I walked around the show with it on my hands and took the plunge to purchase it. Expensive yes but no more than Perricone.<br />Pros: it seems to be working already on lines,  puffiness, and sagging. What some reviews describe as drying is the tightening effect.<br />Cons: the fragrance.  Cheap, chemically and it makes me itch.  A good chance that may dissipate but using the regular fragrance free cream takes the itch away.<br /><br />Infinite Aloe needs to make a fragrance free version. Unless my results are spectacular,  I may not reorder due to a very irritating perfume. Unacceptable.<br /><br />I will however reorder the regular formula,  fragrance free. I've had a rash like dry patch on my shin for almost a year.  Strong prescription cortisone creams and every moisturizer I own have done nothing. This takes away the itch and the redness is slowly dissipating.<br /><br />The Aloe Gold seems more effective than all the expensive creams I've tried (I'm 69). But I really want a fragrance free option.\n",
      "859->Not Too Shabby | 3 | 7 | There have been a lot of complaints about the vacuum option of this trimmer.  Let's be realistic....its not a Hoover, it's a trimmer.  It catches MOST of the hairs, which is a lot better than NONE of the hairs.  I've used it a few times so far and haven't had the problem others complained about where the setting is changed mid-trim.  Just hold the thing below the dial, and not right on the dial.  It gave a nice even trim all around.  I've had it for a couple of months, used it 3-4 times, and still haven't had to recharge it.<br /><br />Suggested improvement - A stand would have been great so I could put it in my medicine cabinet and not have it roll around my counter.<br /><br />Tips for using - I found you're better off with dry hair.  When the hair's wet, it's harder for the vacuum to pull it in.  I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  The dial goes 1-9 so I started with 4, which was way too short.  I could have grown that beard from scratch in a couple of weeks.  5 also proved a little short for me.  Be sure to start a lot higher than you think you need, and work your way down if needed.\n",
      "861->Great brush, some drawbacks | 3 | 7 | Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the \"white\" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use \"white\" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to \"Contact an authorized service center for repair.\"  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don't believe the price difference is justified.\n",
      "864->APPLY CORRECTLY IT WORKS ! | 5 | 7 | This is my 3rd time purchasing this product. I am not a fan of its primary ingredient Avobenzine at 3%<br />HOWEVER, I am a retired Esthetician, who is very well versed in product knowledge and Active ingredients, and because I litterally bathe from head 2 toe on my medium tones  Latina skin, I have directed the Pros and Cons...Not wearing Sunscreen is the More Critical dangerous offender than 3% Avobenzine in this product, I tend to use Elta MD tinted on my face when doing makeup, it plays well with makeup, and actually so does this. For those putting this Sunscreen down I ask, did u put the recommended one full 1/4 teaspoon on just ur face ? And reapply the same every two hours ?<br />I think NOT !

      "878->How is Bay Rum Popular it smells like rotten eggs! | 2 | 7 | I’ve been a Lumé user since Spring of 2020. I like the deodorant because most “natural” deodorants really irritate my sensitive skin where it’s unbearable and anything that’s aluminum based destroys my underarms. The formula of this is nice, I don’t find it to clump in my underarm hair like other deodorants do. It goes on smooth and seems to absorb into my arm pits nicely.<br /><br />Alright so here’s the reasons I scored Lumé Bay Rum so poorly:<br /><br />I’ve been continuously disappointed because any scent that I like, they end up discontinuing. 😭 First it was Blue Spruce or Juniper something that then morphed into Juniper Breeze and then that just disappeared.<br /><br />I was in a bind in June and Bay Rum was the fastest scent that could ship so I tried that one. I figured since it was so popular and has been around for a long time, that this scent was going to be incredible! My expectations were clearly set too high because WOW this stuff STANKS! It smelled like rotten eggs. I know I have an aversion to rum after a bad night at my friends wedding in 2015 but I thought I could put that in the past for the sake of my underarms. Unfortunately, this stuff really stunk and doesn’t even smell like rum anything! Not even rum raisin ice cream or malibu or a beautiful fresh bay!<br /><br />One thing I’ve noticed since buying Lumé from Amazon is that the consistency of each deodorant is never the same. Sometimes it’s an oozing, soupy mess, other times it’s a light fluffy consistency that’s just perfect, then it also can come out like a gritty, frosting that struggled to exit the 3 little holes on the deodorant stick.<br /><br />I’m a big guy and I sweat a lot and there’s a lot of space to cover on my underarms, so I never have been confident in Lumé’s 72-hour claim however I’ve had success with about 24 hours (not with Bay Rum though). Right now I’m using Tangerine and it’s nice and lasts for a little bit… definitely not as long as the OG scents they discontinued, but I can make it through most of the summer day without smelling like a disgusting heap of trash!<br /><br />Some of the other scents don’t last that long on me, but when I put rotten egg smelling Bay Rum on me I really don’t feel like I’m covered at all. I used this for a bit of June and had to throw it out because I couldn’t even go a few hours without smelling stinky.  As a fat person, I’m very aware of my size, my personal hygiene and of course how I smell.<br /><br />Anyways, stay away from this gross scent - maybe I got a bad batch of it, but I’m just scratching my head at how Amazon says this is the most popular scent. Maybe they’re all just trying to sell off this disgusting batch.<br /><br />BRING BACK JUNIPER BREEZE!\n",
      "881->Cheaply made mirror lights not really that bright | 3 | 7 | I had ordered this mirror because I figured it would help me pluck my eyebrows and they had a bunch of LEDs on it it looked like it would be extremely bright. So upon arriving a few days ago is pretty anxious to open it up and try it out and check for myself upon opening it it did feel really cheap it felt like if you meant it too hard you will snap its really made of all plastic. Also another thing I really didn't care for was that the light some cells were not even really that great I got brighter lights in my bathroom to help pluck my eyebrows the only thing this helps with his getting that close to mirror without having it looking at my face into the mirror in the bathroom. But the mirror itself is actually really good I just wish the lights would have been a lot brighter also I like how you were able to dim the lights that was kind of a cool feature but I kind of wish you would have came with a cord instead of just run off regular batteries because nobody wants to change batteries in the middle of doing their eyebrows because the lights went out on their mirror and hopefully you end up having some. But overall I really felt this led mirror to be just ok I didn't think it was all as good as I expected it to be I was hoping it was going to be a lot better than what it actually was but overall really was a decent mirror it's just cheaply made.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this led vanity mirror feel free to ask me.<br /><br />Also if you felt my review to be helpful please check this was helpful... Thanks!\n",
      "882->The best. | 5 | 7 | After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn't spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..\n",
      "883->Design flaw | 2 | 7 | This works well, but has a major design flaw: The on/off button and the button that varies the water pressure are right next to each other. When you are using the flosser in the shower (with your eyes shut so you don't get hit in the eye) you often miss the on/off button and increase the water pressure by mistake. And let me tell you, the highest water pressure is hazardous. In one case it cut my lip!<br /><br />They should have the two buttons separated, or at least distinguished so that you don't mistakenly rivet yourself with high water pressure.\n",
      "890->Keeps your pocket organized and secured | 4 | 7 | Pros:<br />-Keeps my pens secured in my lab coat chest pocket even if I do a forward bend<br />-2 big pockets can keep all the pens, pencils, markers, hemostats that I need<br />-can stash a card or money in the very front pocket with the fold<br />-clip is a nice touch if you need to hang a key on it (I don't)<br />-comes with 2 velcro attachments for pens if you need it, they can be adjusted to fit where you want<br />-good price, fast arrival<br />-keeps items from falling through the seams of my pocket (old lab coats, y'know)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-there were some extra, loose stitching on mine.

I wanted to try something different that were mink so I saw these and the discounted price and bought them. For me these lashes are for like nights that you’re going to the club or some event and want to look over the top glam. I wouldn’t wear these out in daylight lol. Plus they come up to my eyebrows I was like “I look like a straight up clown.” Plus I had to cut off a lot from the lashes to get them sized you could probably put them on a horse.<br />Overall these lashes seem to be for glam night and that’s about it.\n",

I have straight blonde hair, not dyed.<br />They roll up nice, close well, but two steps and they started sliding out.  Tried again at night and they fell out while sleeping.  Sorry, but I returned these.\n",
      "901->Close, but no cigar | 3 | 7 | I used the original Dirt for years, and I was not happy that it simply disappeared from the market.<br />I recently stumbled upon Dirt Products, and I'm so happy to have Dirt back. However, it's drier than the original and not nearly as pliable. Still good, but I think I'm going to have to continue my search for something better and closer to the original.\n",

I'm also not a huge fan of the scent, which is why I wanted to try this one.  I think I will go back to Original Sprouts.\n",
      "908->Rancho Gordo Beans Forever! | 5 | 6 | In our house, we're bean fiends. We eat beans 2-3 times a week in soups, chili, or as a main course with ham hocks. Before, we had bought rock-hard who-knows-how-old grocery store dried beans. These revolutionized our bean game!<br /><br />They seem to be really fresh, so they don't need as much soaking, and they're resistant to becoming mushy if overcooked. They always seem to have the perfect, velvety texture. They're not the cheapest beans, but they're well worth it. This four-pack lasts us about a month eating bean-based dishes a few times a week.\n",
      "916->+fragrance, +shine | 4 | 6 | This sunscreen was released in February 2021; I believe it is the reformulated version of Nivea’s Sun Care UV Milky Gel. Sadly, I dislike the changes made.<br /><br />Shine: The UV Deep Protect & Care Gel is greasier and leaves a shine on the face that persists hours after application. Some people like the dewy look, but I really don’t. I get that this is more oriented toward body and the essence is for face, but I think many customers would use this gel on the face.<br /><br />White cast: None<br /><br />Scent: Contains fragrance, which I generally dislike due to needless exposure to irritation/allergen risk. That said, if you do enjoy fragrance, this is an exceedingly pleasant lychee scent, with a bit of alcohol.<br /><br />Summary: Much better than most American sunscreens in terms of UV protection and cast, but there are more cosmetically elegant Japanese sunscreens available at this price point.\n",
      "925->Great product | 4 | 6 | I Liked this product, those that did not like it, probably didnt use it correctly. I received this bar as a gift from a student. So I am not a verified buyer, as it was gifted.<br /><br />If one read directions and you don’t apply it like regular shampoo, it must be applied at the scalp directly first then run down the strands, this is probably why some people complain about greasy hair, they probably didnt part their hair and apply at scalp.<br /><br />My Tip for using this product, is to be sure you apply at scalp. I applied before getting in the shower at the mirror, to save water, and parted my hair at finger width intervals, wetting the bar as I went, rubbing it my scalp,  before showering, took less than 10 minutes, then once in shower I wet my hair a little bit, and it really lathered up.<br /><br />When I rinsed my hair, I could tell it was clean, felt different from bottle shampoo. You could feel the clean. It felt lighter than usual too..<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but I dont like the peppermint scent, but then I don’t like food scents in my toiletry products. The bar is also really slippery and hard to handle when wet. I was thinking Shampoo bars need a gripper, I might invent one if no one has beat me to it.\n",
      "928->Grainy but perfectly fine to use | 4 | 6 | This shea butter is a good quality shea butter. It is ivory and reasonably priced. As a person whose been using shea butter for well over 10 years for ecezma treatment I can say that this shea butter is a quality product. Although it is a quality shea butter, the way it has been processed left the butter very grainy and not as creamy as I was expecting. It is a thick, heavy butter that is solid at room temperature and has a lot of use for hair and body purposes. It is sourced from an area in Africa that doesn't produce a real rancid smelling butter. It smells distinctly like shea but not like the shea sourced from more eastern countries. The butter when applied to the skin feels thick and heavey but that isn't a problem for me. I would need to indirectly melt and re-solidify this butter in order to smooth it out and kill the grainy texture it comes with. I'd also whip this butter to make it creamy.<br /><br />Price: Reasonable<br />Texture: Grainy but not too smooth, sort of like peanut butter but thicker<br />Color: Ivory, more of an off white, cream like tone<br />Scent: Hard to describe but it's distinctly Shea which never smells pleasing<br /><br />Overall, this company's shea butter is a good quality butter, high quality for some but for me good/decent due to the fact it's grainy and doesn't have the smooth texture I'm used too. The color is normal and the butter feels thick, heavy and heavenly on thick dry skin like eczema. I'd recommend this company's shea butter and possibly repurchase in the future.<br /><br />•This quality shea butter was purchased for a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.\n",
      "937->Received a used machine and it broke after less than 5 months of use | 1 | 6 | I received a used machine.  At the time I thought I'll give it a try and see if it works or not.  It worked amazingly well, I was thrilled with the results so I decided to keep it.  I cleaned and sanitized it completely and I felt it was 'safe' even though it was clearly a used product that I received.  The box had been opened and retaped, there was a bit of nail polish reside left on the little black flexible nail guard that you put your fingers in and the middle light that glows yellow was cracked.  I was just so gosh darn excited about getting this amazing item that I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one.  So it's partly my fault for not returning it.  Well after 5 months of use, it just stopped working.  No heat, no lights, nothing.  I'm crushed that it no longer works but I'm unwilling to purchase another one with the fear it will only last another 5 months.  I think the product and idea are fantastic and it worked great, but the quality control is sorely lacking.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

Eye drops can result in brow ache and chronic use in miosis.<br /><br />Systemic injection of pilocarpine can compromise the blood brain barrier allowing pilocarpine to gain access to the brain which can lead to chronic epilepsy.&#34;<br /><br />Yeah, no thanks. I'm 50% sure this conditioner wouldn't make my scalp sweat more, but why risk it? I'll pass. This is why we google first, class.\n",
      "952->One of the best sunscreens.. | 5 | 6 | I purchased this product because my dad told me it was one of the best (he heard it on the news so it has to be the truth.. Right?) So when I received it we were going to the beach that weekend. Best time to try it out if you ask me. One of my children has dark skin and the other is pale and burns easily. We applied it 15 minutes before heading down to the beach and we were out in the sun for hours. Neither one of them burned.<br />I used it as well as my husband and it did its job very well. I even got a little tan but no burning. My husbands face burns very easily and this stuff protected him 100% and we only applied it once. I probably should of put it on my kids a few times in the amount of time we were there but I had left it in the hotel room. I am very pleased with this product. It doesn't smell strong at all and once on the skin it doesn't feel heavy and make you feel sticky. It soaks in nicely! The sand stuck to us a little but all we had to do was brush it off with our hand or towel and it fell right off. When others make the sand stick and stay on which is no good. I will be purchasing a couple more tubes!\n",
      "955->Shimmery | 4 | 6 | I didn't buy this from Amazon directly, but only because there weren't enough reviews for me to actually purchase it. So, I ordered &#34;You Light Up My Life&#34;, the gold looking one.<br /><br />It's very sheer, which is why I chose 4 stars, but pretty. My skin is tan, which is why I went with the gold. I'm not much into makeup, so I went with something that would mostly blend into my skin but still shine. This is primarily because the last thing on my face is a mattifying powder that tends to flatten out the appearance my skin.<br /><br />My swatches of it are of the highlighter blended into my skin and then with 1, 2, and 3 layers to see if it was buildable. It doesn't build too much, but I'm not a makeup artist, so maybe someone else can do a better job than I can. The 1st photo is in direct light, and the second is in less direct light.<br /><br />It has a magnetic closure, which is unseen, and there is a protective film on the little mirror.\n",
      "963->Amazing product if you have limp hair! | 5 | 6 | I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions herein are my own and are not swayed by the company.<br /><br />I was absolutely ecstatic to receive this product in the mail to try! I am always have issues with my hair. One of these issues is that fact that it ALWAYS lays flat. It is the most annoying thing to me to not be able to make my hair do anything other than straighten it.<br />I am so thankful that I have been introduced to this product because I know I have a new favorite hair-styling product. Zotos is cheap! It's only $12.99 on Amazon. If you're interested, you can also check out their other products on their website.<br />Not only do I love the fact that it definitely makes my hair have more volume, but I completely adore the fact that the smell is amazing! This product has no harsh smells that some hairsprays have. It actually smells like you're getting your hair done in a salon with that amazing hair salon smell that I love!<br />This product is extremely unique because it has a blend of clay and silica. This enables the spray to feel dry as it goes on as well as help build texture that lasts for a whole night of partying, (or whatever you enjoy doing). It's also color safe which is an absolute huge bonus for me!<br />This is a super easy product to use as well. You don't have to have a special type of brush to use it to style your hair. All you do is open the cap, shake the product, spray onto dry hair. I like to blow dry my hair after I put it on because the heat helps me when I'm styling.<br />If you actually want to style your hair rather than just put it on and go, just do whatever hairstyle you want, spray the product, and voila! Amazing hair results in a short amount of time.\n",
      "964->Definitely a brush for a petite person. | 1 | 6 | This is probably the worst purchase I have made on Amazon. Not the right brush for a 6'2\" man. It is much smaller than I expected. The overall length is 14\" . The brush is 3 x2.5.<br />I will be returning.\n",
      "971->Great gift set! | 4 | 6 | This comes in such a cute box, perfect for a gift. The three items are 1. a pink jade roller with one smaller side and one larger side, 2. a roll-on bottle with rose quartz pieces in it (but no liquid), and 3. a micro needle roller. The latter is kind of scary as I’ve never experienced microneedling before, but eventually I think I’ll work my way up to it, maybe start on my arms or something to try it out.<br /><br />The jade roller is nice but unfortunately the second I took it out of the box it was in two pieces, with the larger roller detached from the main handle. They say on their page though that if you let them know it was broken, they’ll send a replacement which seems very nice. For the time being I just kind of jammed the handle back into it and it seems fine for now.<br /><br />The roller bottle with the quartz pieces in it is a little odd, I don’t fully understand the purpose or why it’s better than a regular bottle of serum, but it’s a cool way of applying any serum you want to put in the bottle.\n",
      "972->A Great Item For A Great Price | 5 | 6 | I've had this tooth brush for 2 weeks now and I'm very pleased with it. I'm a \"hard-brusher\" and I tend to bleed from my guns occasionally. This brush is very gentle on the gums, and I've yet to bleed using it. In fact, my teeth have never felt so clean before.<br /><br />There are so many different brushes available out there, and they can get very expensive. I'm not sure what a $200 brush can do different than this one. It can't get much better than this. So, I highly recommend this to all!\n",
      "973->The color is way off from the description | 3 | 6 | I wanted to try the breathable nail polish. I prefer frosts or pearls, and pinks. My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It's like the 1950's). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish's kryptonite! I added a photo. All the polish came off the ends when my nails got super wet and soft.<br />But I will say the polish lasted much longer than my usual brand (Hansens).\n",
      "975->Very pretty | 2 | 6 | Pretty and lustrous but has a hump on top I was never able to smooth down. No matter what product I tried or even using heat. That hump just stayed.<br />Great parting space.\n",
      "979->5 stars!? Really!? | 1 | 6 | I found this \"magnetic liner\" just to be another fad or gimmick to try ...<br />It only has 3 small magnetic strips on the lash and the magnetic liner was so weak at best!!<br />I found it to be 1 star! I would of given it 0 but it was not available!<br />Very disappointed!!!\n",
      "982->Great for not so common uses! | 5 | 6 | When faced with the daunting task of replacing a 15\" drain tube in a boat, one asks themselves, \"How the heck am I going to coat the inside of this opening with sealant?\"<br /><br />Did a little poking around Amazon and I found these wonderful hair rollers that were just the right size to get the job done. It wasn't pretty, as I coated the hair roller in tan-colored sealant and then repeatedly inserted the roller into the boat to generously coat the insides of the hole with sealant, but hey, I'll be darned if it didn't get the job done!<br /><br />There's a use for everything, and it turns out that these hair rollers are good for more than just one thing. I can't say much for how they do with hair, but I can say, if they can handle the abuse that I put them through to get the inside of a hole in a boat coated with sealant, they should hold up just fine for hair!<br /><br />Great product, highly recommended, no matter what you need them for!\n",
      "983->Too rough to use every day, but nice once in a while | 4 | 6 | I ordered this 3-pack of Salux towels for the shower to help with rough bumpy skin on the backs of my legs, and to have an easy way to scrub my back.<br /><br />They take some getting used to, partially because they're so long and don't immediately lather like sponges do. I prefer to keep it folded, wet it, add some soap or shower gel, and rub/scrunch it together until a lather forms. I used it folded on my body, and then unfold it to full length to use on my back (like the picture shows). You have to keep it out of the stream of water, or else the soap will wash right out of it.<br /><br />They were definitely much more harsh than I expected - I can only use them very gently, and can't use them at all on especially thin areas of skin like my shins, the tops of my feet, or my chest. I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin. But after I began to scrub with them daily, I felt like it actually exacerbated the problem. Plus, it was just another item to keep in the bathroom and worry about washing every week. As a side note, I wish they made these in white or grey instead of the bright colors - I feel like they'd match so many more peoples' bathroom decor and I wouldn't feel as bad about leaving one lying around the bathroom.<br /><br />Now, I just use a Salux once per week as an exfoliating treatment - they're definitely too strong to be an everyday thing for me, but it does the job and helps with my bumps overall.\n",
      "997->Barebalm | 4 | 6 | I'm cursed with back hair. I've tried many products and have had mixed results. Barebalm is probably the best one I have used but it's not perfect.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />Doesn't smell horrible.<br />Doesn't leave a rash and I've incurred only a few ingrown hairs.<br />The hair doesn't come back for about 2-3 weeks, most everything else I've used last's a week.<br />Works very well on the boy parts.<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />The cream is too thick. It has almost like a sand consistency. A lighter version would work so much better.<br />Doesn't remove all the hair. Granted, it will remove about 80% with one application but a second application is usually necessary to get the rest.\n",
      "1000->Good Purchase | 4 | 6 | I was skeptical about this cleansing brush because it didn’t have the shape that could get into crevices. I’m glad I got over it. I’ve been using this and an older model I bought years ago and this one wins hands down. I don’t really have acne. My issues are t-zone congestion and my skin’s texture isn’t smooth. I’m in my mid 30s so I’m trying to get on the anti-aging boat lol. I really like that this has a heat feature. However, It takes about 1 minute 30<br />seconds to heat up so I’ll let it run and do something else. Wen it shuts off then I turn it on again and actually use it. Also the heat is mild. The device makes my skin super smooth and is gentle on the skin. I have combo/normal skin and I can’t stop touching my face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is still smooth. I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don’t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn’t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can’t speak on it being waterproof.  I’m thinking of purchasing another one for when the current one needs replacing. This device either has a 1 year warranty which is wonderful. I strongly recommend you give this a try.\n",
      "1002->Works as advertised | 4 | 6 | The first time I used this product, I did it exactly as directed. I do a lot of housekeeping, artwork, full grooms on my dog, but my manicure lasted over a week. I wanted to change colors at that point, so started picking at it. Since I was a little premature, it didn’t come off as easily as I hoped, but it was easier (and faster!) than other dip polish removal methods. It also didn’t add to the damage on my nails.<br />The second time I used it, I did two coats, but really don’t recommend that because my polish popped off randomly, with the first “pop” happening the next day.<br />Overall, I think it’s a good product that I will use regularly.\n",
      "1010->Good, but maybe not worth the price | 4 | 6 | This is the kids’ version of Curl Keeper and as far as I can tell, it’s the very same product just with different packaging and a slightly lower price. The ingredient lists are the same on both versions. I bought this version because it costs a little less. I’m not crazy about the price of the original Curl Keeper but I had heard a lot of good things about it and I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I have 2C-3A wavy-curly, high-porosity hair and I live in a humid climate. I like this product. It’s a light hold, clear liquid gel. It seems to do a good job of defining my curls and smoothing the cuticle to decrease frizz, even when I use it alone or just with a curl cream. It’s also nice to use for a damp or dry restyle in between wash days.<br /><br />I cannot say for sure whether I will re-purchase this. I do think it’s overpriced. There is a similar gel at Sa-lly beauty (the GVP version of Sebastian wet) that costs under 8 dollars. The Sally has several proteins and the Kinder does not, so this a great choice for protein-sensitive hair. I may repurchase to alternate with the Sally but most likely I’ll keep looking for a protein-free liquid gel that is priced a little lower.\n",
      "1013->Not an instantaneous cure ... StriMedix-K requires patience and consistency | 4 | 6 | I was originally looking for a quick cure for my spider veins. StirMedix-K is by no means quick acting. I've gone through an entire bottle of the stuff, and though it's working ... it works very slowly.<br /><br />In order to work at all, the product must be applied faithfully twice every day, morning and evening. It's very important that you observe the instruction to &#34;moisten the skin with warm water&#34;. Doing so will help assure a deeper and more thorough penetration of the product.<br /><br />Also, be prepared to make a commitment to this product or any similar product that you use. Once you stop using it, the veins will slowly and surely come back. For me it's worth the $27 (after adding &#34;shipping and handling&#34;) I pay for the stuff every few weeks.\n",
      "1020->Price hike and how! | 5 | 6 | I love this product!! BUT! I hate your price!! I get this at Sally’s beauty supply for $8.95 ! (I’m not a beautician) SAME EXACT THING!<br />Shame on you Amazone ! (Yes I spelled it wrong!)\n",
      "1024->Pricey, But Worth It To Have a GOOD Charger | 5 | 6 | I own a Galaxy S6 Edge Plus... AND an iPhone 6 (Work Phone), AND a Galaxy Tab4 10.1, AND a New Trent Battery 12,000 mAh Pack.  With that said, each one of these devices is using it's own charger and because of that, I had to resort using a power strip by my bedside JUST to charge all my devices.<br /><br />The current chargers I use are all stock (1 Apple Charger, 3 Samsung Chargers).  One of the Samsung Chargers is directly from the S6 Edge Plus (supports Adaptive Fast Charging/Quick Charge 2.0), yet it fails to work 80% of the time on my S6 Edge Plus for whatever reason...<br /><br />Another issue is when I go away for overnight trips somewhere.  For a day, I could probably just get by with just the iPhone charger & Samsung charger, but when I have 3-4 night stays due to work, I have to pack all of them!!!  It's just a big hassle.  That's when I decided I'm just going to resort to buying a GOOD multi-port charger.  I've used Ankur devices in the past and I've been very pleased with all of them.  After reading various reviews, I decided the 3-port is perfect for my situation.<br /><br />For $25, you get a 3-port charger: 2 PowerIQ ports and 1 Quick Charge 2.0 port (which the Edge+ takes advantage of).<br /><br />I've used the Ankur PowerIQ tech before via an Ankur Car Charger and I can definitely say it's almost as good as the Quick Charge 2.0 technology.  What I like about it is that it supposedly &#34;detects&#34; what kind of device is connected to it and charges accordingly.  Whether this is true or snake oil, I can say that it charges my devices fast and never has any kind of power dip when you have multiple devices connected to it.  I use these two ports for my iPhone, Galaxy Tab4 and New Trent Battery pack.<br /><br />The single Quick Charge is dedicated to my Galaxy S6 phone and right out of the box (same cables and all), it would fast charge my phone 100% of the time.  Unlike my old stock Quick Charge Charger, it never seemed to work.  So when I'm charging my phone and seeing it will fully charge within an hour makes me happy!<br /><br />The only initial turnoff is the $25 sticker price.  Yes you get a multi-port charger, but I think maybe that sticker price will scare some people.  But after experiencing and using this product, I think that $25 is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Never have a poor quality/flaky charger again.  I'm 100% pleased with this item!\n",
      "1025->Usage rate is inaccurate on label | 2 | 6 | This product should be used at .5%<br />I had countless batches of lotion grow mold within only a number of weeks, because I was following the directions on the label. Germall Plus is used at .5%, but this product is so viscous, I assumed it was a more concentrated version.  I also assumed it was safe following directions on the packaging.<br /><br />The product itself deserves 5 stars, as it is the easiest and most effective preservative I’ve worked with (once I started using it correctly).  This is actually the second bottle I’ve purchased with these instructions on it.  The other bottle of Germall Plus was purchased on Etsy over a year ago, and both have the name HalalEveryday on the label somewhere.  This isn’t a small issue.  Luckily, I figured this out while still using the first bottle.<br />But since the products have the same name and same wrong instructions, I figured I would try to save someone the time and money I lost.  It’s worth purchasing- just don’t follow the instructions on the bottle for .2%\n",
      "1033->Great for cosplay wigs and and messy kid hair | 5 | 6 | I purchased this as a detangler for my synthetic cosplay wigs after I tried this out from a friend. This has been the best lifesaver ever for my wigs! I've thrown away so many wigs in the past because I just couldn't get out all the tangles without ruining the wig or having it get all frizzy and lose its shape. Now my wigs are soft, tangle free, and retains its original shape  just like it was from the first time I took it out of the package.  Just spray on and brush from the bottom up in small sections.<br /><br />Big plus, it's also great for messy kid hair.  It makes brushing out my daughters hair a pleasant experience and not one that ends in tears and frustration.  Super easy to use!\n",
      "1035->Very exciting...at first | 2 | 6 | I was so hyped about this because I don't have many palettes in general especially colors, and I LOVE green. I mostly bought this for the hot pink and the greens tbh. At first I was super impressed with the pigmentation on the mattes, but then I tried the shimmers and they were very dull and more powdery than sparkly. The loose glitters are AWFUL. Just straight up trash. After sitting on my lids for a couple minutes it actually looked like I just had a bunch of crusty eye boogers. I'm willing to bet this isn't a genuine product. I can't believe anyone on Colourpop's team would greenlight glitters that do not glitter.<br />That beautiful looking slime green metallic is soo dull. It's so sad. It might as well just be a matte. I'm basically keeping this for the pinks, that one matte green, and the blue. And the cute packaging\n",
      "1036->The best epilator I have tried - but the battery sucks | 2 | 6 | Update:<br /><br />After a year and a half of occasional use, the battery has significantly worn out. I have queried Google, yahoo, and Amazon looking for the battery and cannot find it for sale anywhere, including on Braun's web site. I have also tried emailing Braun several times but have never received a response. Six months later, I am going to try emailing them again, but I don't expect to get a response this time either since they seem to not give a (explitive). It's not like the battery is not easily replaced; two TORX screws, pull the unit out of the casing, and the battery is right there. Apply dielectric grease or vaseline on the seals, put it back together. It's not hard, so they should make the battery available for purchase via their web site!<br /><br />My recommendation? Despite my initial 5/5 review, I have to knock a few stars off. You can save a good amount of money and get a corded Braun that will last much longer than this unit.<br /><br />------<br /><br />This is by far the best epilator I have ever tried. My first one was an Epilady coil epilator. Remember those? Very effective, but very painful the first few uses, and I never could manage to use it on my legs for more than a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />I've tried these rotary \"tweezer\" type epilators from other companies - Emjoi for example - and wasted money on them. I could not manage to do my legs with them because they were so painful so they went largely unused.<br /><br />Enter the 7281 - I can't get over how well this epilator works. Unlike the crap brands, this unit is not made from cheap loose-fitting pot metal. The \"tweezers\" use a plastic and stainless steel tweezer to get a really tight grip on each hair and pulls it out. I will not say it is painless, but it is every bit as effective as the old \"coil\" type epilators, with much less pain. This is the very first epilator I have ever been able to manage to use on my legs and do it all in one session.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br /> - It is extremely effective; almost as effective as waxing<br /> - The Braun 7281 is far less painful than other epilators; I successfully cleared my legs in one session!<br /> - The massaging head really does help reduce pain. I have tried it without any head, with the basic pivoting head, and the massaging head. It does not eliminate the pain but it does greatly reduce it. The pain reduction is definitely noticeable.<br /> - Once you clear an area keeping up with it is painless<br /> - The light makes seeing missed hairs extremely easy<br /> - It is fully washable - a major win since oil buildup is the bane of epilators<br /> - The shaver is okay; I tried it on my underarms (even with the 7281 I am timid to try epilating there)<br /> - It really does work very well in the bath/shower/steam room!<br /> - As far as epilators go, the Braun SE7281WD is very quiet. Note: \"very quiet\" in this context is a relative term!<br /><br />----<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br /> - The power supply is an odd size \"wall wart\" - Wall Warts are evil as they cover 2-3 other outlets when in use. If anyone at Braun is reading this: please switch to a power supply similar to laptops, which does not cover more than one outlet and the transformer can sit on the floor. That would be a great product feature. Just remember: wall warts are the devil!<br /> - Even as well as this unit reduces pain, if you don't keep up with an area and let it regrow, it will be more painful than if you keep up with it. This con is not specific to the Braun 7281 but to epilation in general.<br /><br />----<br /><br />The price: I listed this as people would most likely complain about the \"high\" price of the Braun. However if you consider that before you buy one like this you have already bought at least one or two other epilators, or have been waxing up to now, please consider the total cost. This unit is cheaper than all the wax I have bought added up, and is cheaper than the previous epilators I have tried. Given all of that and just how well this unit works I would say that it is definitely worth the selling price.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Update: I now regret going with the 7281. A little over a year after purchase battery life significantly decreased, and now a few months later I'm lucky to get a couple of minutes on a charge. I opened it and found it uses a Li-Ion cell, so I searched for it online  (Sanyo UR18500L) and I cannot find ANY reliable sources for the battery - and I am NOT going to pay Braun's inflated price for spending less than five minutes to replace what should be a $12.00-$15.00 battery pack.  What a fraking waste of money.<br /><br />I emailed them and included my update above.  Oh - and finding a link or form to email them was not very easy or obvious on their site. You need to drill down through support FAQs then say no it didn't help then you finally get a form which gives you neither feedback nor emails you a copy of your inquiry so obviously it goes into a black hole where it will be ignored.<br /><br />(Hint: replacing the battery pack takes less than five minutes; remove two torx screws, pull unit apart. Replace battery pack. Grease seals with either dielectric grease or vaseline. Reassemble in reverse order.  The only problem? The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match ANYWHERE.)\n",
      "1049->Unusual scent | 4 | 6 | It's an interesting scent, not one I've experienced before. It comes from the helichrysum flower, but doesn't really have a flower scent to me. At least, it doesn't have your usual flower scent which usually makes my nose itch.<br /><br />I personally like to use it in my oil diffuser, just a couple of drops works well for me. I haven't yet used it topically, but I've read that it does great things for acne and inflammation.<br /><br />I like the size of the bottle, it will definitely last me quite awhile. I also like how it comes with a standard lid, and the dropper so that I can store it without the dropper. I read somewhere that essential oils have a tendency to wear down a dropper so this form of packaging is great. Plus if you clean out the dropper well, you can use the same dropper for other oils so you don't have a dozen lying around.\n",
      "1054->New Maybuy Beard Trimmer Takes On Viking Beard -- And Wins! | 5 | 6 | The gene pool I come from has Viking, German, and Irish heritage -- resulting in a stiff wiry beard that defeats most cordless beard trimmers.  To give this trimmer a good chance I followed the directions and charged it for the two hours as recommended in the instructions.  My only gripe about this process is that you're supposed to keep an eye on it so that when charging is finished you can disconnect it immediately to avoid potential damage.  Since the unit has no automatic shut-off when charging is completed, you have to keep an eye on it to avoid a problem.  That is my only gripe about this unit.  Not too many people have the time flexibility to watch it for the two hours (or less) it needs to charge.<br /><br />While it only comes with 3 attachments that is all you really need.  The shaver itself is large enough to give you a firm grip and the weight implies quality.  The initial effort at trimming my beard was highly successful.  I grew it for two weeks to make it a challenge and then shaved it without using any attachments.  Normally (with other units) I would have expected difficulty in shaving it flush with my skin. Typically this type of trimmer is not powerful enough to plow through my beard, pulls some hair out instead of cutting it, and sometimes nicks my skin.  None of that happened here.  Evidently the battery and the motor are up to the task.<br /><br />This is by far the best cordless trimmer I have ever owned and used.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "1058->Works wonders! Will never be without this product! | 5 | 6 | My daughter loves this product.<br />She has straight, medium thick, longer than shoulder length hair. She likes to straighten it with a flat iron, dry it with a hair dyer; then she complains of 'frizzy hair' and damaged ends.  I took her recently to a mall with a REGIS salon for a trim. The professional there used this product and recommended it for her. She used it once then lost it! It was $10 there; much more expensive on Amazon but the Regis was 1/2 hour away - so I bit the bullet and purchased this.<br />Yes - it makes a difference.<br />Yes - it makes her hair silkier and softer when she dries it.<br />She loves this product and I will continue to purchase it for her. Nest time I am at that mall with the Regis 1/2 hour away I am stocking up!!\n",
      "1060->Chalky Makeup | 2 | 6 | I'm an experience makeup user and have always prefer known brand for makeup. I purchase this so I can use it for practice simply because I don't want to waste my more expensive contouring palette. Unfortunately, I personally don't like this for various reasons. The highlighters are chalky while the contours have poor coverage and both my brushes and my fingers can't even get it to pickup and won't stick on the skin. The only good thing is I didn't have any allergies using this.<br /><br />If you're a newbie when it comes to makeup, wanted to try contouring, can't decide which color suits you or simply wants a cheaper palette then this palette might be for you. But if you wanted something with better quality then I don't recommend this.\n",
      "1061->it slipped right through my fingers like dry sand | 1 | 6 | Once I scooped some up, it slipped right through my fingers like dry sand. Impossible to use.<br /><br />So I looked at the FIVE STAR reviews, and, once again, they are mainly UNverified purchases.<br /><br />Allowing sellers to buy fake reviews to increase the ratings which misleads buyers really lowers the standards of the website.\n",
      "1064->I mean, it works! | 4 | 6 | I just got this in the mail today and was so excited to try it since I was in a rush.<br />The eyeliner STAMP is very light in my opinion. I was able to use it as an outline and go over with my regular liquid liner though and made it work. The regular side has a wonderful find tip but it gets wide so fast it's like using a giant marker!<br />It got the job done fast though which I really liked. It will take some practice to get perfectly matching wings, so be cautious!\n",
      "1069->Well, I had high hopes... | 2 | 6 | I have very thin, very fine, very curly hair and a small head… I STRUGGLE to find headbands that work for me. Headbands do not stay on my head unless I have a gallon of hairspray dumped on and then put the headband on top. Because my hair is so fine and curly, it gets damaged very easily from Elastic/ribbon bands, etc. so I was really looking forward to having a headband hold my hair in place will simply clipping it up. The first couple days with this headband were great… Then it started sliding so i washed it to try and get the tackiness back, and it seems like it’s done nothing... it’s sliding out of my hair just as much as if I didn’t wash it. The picture I have attached is after me wearing it for about two hours, chasing around my newborn, it completely slides up… And this is after I have fixed it at least once or twice. Disappointing :(<br /><br />The colors are nice and it shipped fast.\n",
      "1075->Awesome Customer Service | 5 | 6 | Doesn't smell a lot like I had expected.  smell I mean, there was a faint scent, but I would have liked a little more.  The product did somewhat moisturized my skin.<br /><br />~UPDATE~<br />So, the seller reached out to me to correct this issue.  I was completely blown away by the service. I have purchased and reviewed many products on Amazon but I’d have to say this is the only seller that really wanted to rectify the “issue”. THANK YOU!<br /><br />With that, FIVE STARS! To me, customer service is everything! In fact, I may not have like the Watermelon, but I will try another scent!\n",
      "1084->Lasts for MONTHS. | 5 | 6 | I purchased this hair for my young step-kid and installed it. I am not a stylist, and using the crochet method was very easy to learn. My step-kid loves this hair so much that she has worn it for months now. I regularly remove them from her hair, soak them in water with dishwashing liquid while I am simultaneously washing her hair, and then I reinstall the hair when it is dry. She just wears one of those extra long satin scarves to bed to keep the twists from fraying.<br /><br />Learning how to install these myself has saved a lot of money. I don't even know how to do cornrows, so I had to find a method of braiding on YouTube that flatly connects braids together. These twists have made it through months of a busy tween, so they are a good buy for everyone.\n",
      "1086->DON'T  waste your money | 1 | 6 | This product is NOT a real alcohol wipe. It is a microscopic sized piece of fabric masquerading as a wipe. I doubt that they are 1/8th the size of a real alcohol wipe.<br /><br />Merchant is tricking you. Amazon should not allow this item to be sold as an alcohol wipe.\n",
      "1087->Dissapointed. | 2 | 6 | So I've seen similar products online, and was hesitant believing this can be better than a regular hair straightener.<br />I tested it today, and I can honestly say I will stick with my straighter.<br />- The package came with the heating brushy 2 clips and a cleaning tool.<br />- in order to get the best results, it was required that you section your hair in numerous sections, or you'd be left with crimps. I posted a picture below after several swipes of the brush. You really have to brush hard to get better results, but the brush is so hard, it hurt my scalp.<br />- the biggest let down was the fact this product pulled my hair to the point it hurt! After using it, there was numerous strands in the brush. I ended up finishing my hair with my regular straightener.<br /><br />I had high hopes, but was overall disappointed in this product.\n",
      "1089->Great set! | 5 | 6 | [[VIDEOID:6e38d17a23354ccb47f63bde906912cf]] This Love It three piece set of tweezers is really handy.  You get a flat topped pair, a slanted pair, and a pointed pair.  This is great because not all tweezing needs are the same.  I especially needed a pair of pointed ones because I tend to have hairs break off when I try to pull them out and these can get to the hair where other tweezers cannot.  This a great little set and I love that it comes with a carrying pouch.  Now I can just throw them in my purse and always be ready if a random hair is caught staring back at me in the mirror when I am out and about.  Overall I am glad that I have them and highly recommend them to anyone needing a great set of tweezers.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

      "1097->For Facial Use Only! | 2 | 5 | First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor.  Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2\" high.  It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean.  It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.<br /><br />I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.  You'll need it to clearcut your axillary forest.\n",
      "1098->I'm a beginner at contouring. This kit was perfect for me. | 5 | 5 | I have a very fair skin tone - my foundation range is usually ivory, or light ivory, the lightest choices. I am no makeup guru, but am intrigued with all the contouring I see going on in social media and magazines. I wanted to know more, but needed a tutorial on how to do this for my face. I liked this set because it came with instructions on how to apply correctly for a contour effect.<br /><br />Each palette in this set is made up of a blush like material - there is no foundation or creamy application to it. Each shade is also matte, and does not include any pearly or sheen tint to it.  The directions state to apply your regular foundation FIRST, then use this contour kit, THEN follow up with your regular blush and bronzer.<br /><br />I really loved the brush that was included in the kit. It gave me much better contouring effects than any brush I have used from my makeup set before.  The brush is thick and flat.  Because this is a powder/blush application, this gave me noticeable contouring on my face, without being too dramatic like a foundation contour product might do that requires sponge blending. I was able to blend this powder in as much as I liked, which softened the contour look.  As I get more confident in my application, I won't need to blend it in as much, but will enjoy a little more drama in the application.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great product for someone like me to try out that is just getting started with contouring.  For a more advanced or skilled makeup artist, I'd assume you would want more dramatic effects than this powder supplies.<br /><br />Promotional discount offered for review purposes\n",

The cap DOES NOT hold well so I wouldn't throw this into my purse.<br /><br />Will I repurchase?  NO.\n",

      "1111->It's decent or WHATEVER | 4 | 5 | Ok so i totally didnt realize this was a 2 for 1 lol. That's what happens when you buy stuff at 2am with 1 eye open lol. Either way that is more than fine and for the price surely not complaining. So lets break it down to why its 4 stars and not 5.<br /><br />Long Curly: This is worth the price of admission alone. So soft. Such pretty defined spirals. Nice length. Nice fullness. Taught drawstring. Minimal shed if any. (I had minimal fall out when i shook it to loosen it up when i removed it from the bag.)<br /><br />Afro Puff: *eye roll* oooooh GURL! Shed like a poodle at the groomer. Dry but not stiff. I guess you can say it feels like natural hair. It however looks like a over beaten ball of fur. Minimal curl definition. Dont look NOTHING like the picture. The ONLY reason im not sending it back is because i didnt know I was buying it in the first place. All i wanted was the long pony.<br /><br />For $13-15 (average range) the piece i wanted was exceptional. I'll keep this afro thing and use to scare kids at halloween with or something.\n",
      "1117->decent product, just not for me | 3 | 5 | I purchased 001 ivory; i'm somewhere around NW13, and Missha BB #13 is a good winter color match. This product is just a little lighter, which i could have worked with if the tone didn't run neutral to warm (i ended up looking rather gray). The formula did not bother my sensitive skin, and application was super easy. I was looking for a light coverage product; this is more medium coverage that can be built up to full coverage. I'm going to say that this product's formula is a lot like a liquid foundation, because it broke up on my skin like most liquid foundations do (i guess i have weird skin?). I was hoping for more of a BB cream or very thin consistency, since that is what works for my skin.<br />Overall this is not a bad product. The packaging is super cute and sturdy, you get a lot of coverage for a product that is so easy to apply, and this color will work well on any pale prince/ss with neutral to warm and neutral-olive undertones.\n",
      "1118->great exfoliator | 5 | 5 | As an esthetician who believes in exfoliating with acids, this goes against my training.  But I like this &#34;razor&#34;.<br /><br />There is no actual blade and I used it to exfoliate my skin, not for shaving facial hair.  So I used it every 3rd week, 1 week prior to giving myself a light peel.<br /><br />It has been 2 months and so far so good.\n",
      "1121->BETTER THAN SCENTBIRD Bottles | 5 | 5 | UPDATE (1-2 months later): Previous to receiving these cases, I had not actually received a case from ScentBird (they messed up on my initial order). I like these bottles way more than the ones that ScentBird offers. The middle chrome strip is bevelled so it feels more lux when you twist it. The perfume twists up and down better. Don't purchase extra cases from ScentBird, buy these instead.<br /><br />--- --- ---<br />These cases fit my ScentBird purfumes PERFECTLY. I actually prefer the bottle and mister that comes with these cases to the ones I get in my subscription.<br /><br />Do not put your case near things that can scratch it up. It is otherwise durable.<br /><br />I have not had an issue where the purfumes is slipping out of the case. The perfume actually fits perfectly without it too tight.<br /><br />I have had no issues switching bottles in and out of these cases.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "1122->Perfect, Beautiful, Natural Looking Wig Right Out Of The Bag | 5 | 5 | HAIRCUBE Natural Looking Short Blonde Wigs Pixie Cut Dark Root Ombre Blonde Wigs with Bangs Wigs for Women is a beautiful, natural looking wig. The pixie cut is so perfect, I put this on right out of the bag, used my fingers to part it, and couldn’t believe how natural it looks. The wig has elastic around the sides that stretches to fit your head. Around the ears are comfortable flaps. Inside the wig are four tiny combs to keep it in place. As for the bangs, if they are too long, no cutting is needed- just pull the wig back farther.<br /><br />The color is gorgeously mixed with the darker roots and several blonde colors mixed together for a truly natural look. There is no shiny fake look to the sheen and it’s not too thick, making it so natural. The heaviest part of the hair is where it should be on top of the head and with the bangs layered beautifully. The back is layered perfect as well and is so breathable! You can part it any where and it always looks perfect. The wig also comes with directions and a net to cover your hair. A perfect, natural looking wig right out of the bag!\n",

I was hoping to save money and use this with my traditional lipsticks, but I will eventually have to convert it all over to Revlon ColorStay lip color.  It is the Gold Standard.<br /><br />I tried applying before lipstick.  After lipstick.  Both.  It simply does not work.\n",
      "1128->Not worth the money | 1 | 5 | I don’t usually leave reviews. This item was pretty disappointing to me. I was not expecting such a small bottle for the price that it is.<br />Also, from reading the customer reviews, I got the impression that this removed hair as well as inhibiting it. It does not remove hair.<br />I tried using it for awhile. It did not feel comfortable on my face, so I stopped using it for my facial hair. I tried it on my pelvic hair. But, pretty soon, that area started to break out. I have red spots all over. It was not worth the money at all.\n",
      "1129->Impossible to apply without bruising your armpits ! | 1 | 5 | I have been using Primal pit paste  ( the jar version )for couple of months now and i was very happy with it. My only concern was that i had to apply it with a spatula . Thats why i decided to order this stick.<br />BIG mistake ...the product is so hard to apply that every time a literally bruised my armpits while doing it. How come the jar version is so soft and the stick version is like frozen sand. After 2 attempts my armpits are already red and hurting !\n",
      "1132->STOP AND BUY! IT WORKS AND ITS AMAZING! | 5 | 5 | This stuff is AWESOME!! If you have stretched ears then this is a MUST HAVE. It makes stretching and maintaining a healthy lobe so easy.

      "1140->An awesome deal for many items!!! | 4 | 5 | This Poly Gel kit came with everything! An awesome deal for many items! It takes some practice to use poly gel but watching a ton of youtube videos can help. You get 6 tubes of poly gel, each 1 oz (30 ML), AND two containers of gems, which is a great deal for $11. A few downsides for me were that the slip solution was half empty and the base coat had white dried flakes, which left a weird residue on my nails, but was easily fixed by putting the poly gel on top.<br /><br />P.S I am using my Dad's amazon account to review.\n",
      "1142->Works but pricey and takes a while to absorb | 3 | 5 | Purchased this for a trip I was taking to Cancun. My skin burns easily so I didn't take any chances while there.  I applied and reapplied this sunscreen about every 2-3 hours.  I'm so glad I did.  I did not get burned while I was there, which by the way was spent almost entirely in the sun.  They say that only biodegradable sunscreen was allowed in Cancun, but absolutely nobody there asked us about the type of sunscreen we were using.  I wish I had known that, because otherwise I would've taken my regular sunscreen.  But this stuff did the job, so I was happy about that.  What I was not happy about was the amount of time it took to rub it into my skin.  It goes on white and stays that way until you rub it in and is absorbed.  I'm also not happy about the scent.  It wasn't bad, but I like a good Cocoa butter scent in my sunscreen/tanning oils.  This one had more of a chemical smell.  I was also not too happy with the price.<br /><br />Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.\n",

      "1147->I’m a Hair Stylist and was curious about these. | 3 | 5 | These curlers are good for people who have a hard time with standard rollers.<br />Frankly, for straight hair it is far less effort to use a curling wand. With the right sectioning and product, you will get a better curl that way...and way faster.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Your hair should be damp. If you try to pull your hair through these dry, it will be painful and potentially damage your hair.<br />You might want to start the curl a couple of inches or more away from the root so you don’t get a weird kink.<br />When you are ready to remove these, pinch the rubber opening closest to your root open then gently pull curler.\n",
      "1149->Review about packaging not product efficacy | 1 | 5 | I didn't get to use the product so this is just a review on the packaging. I've read many reviews saying the tape seal on the box it comes in is broken but decided to take a chance. Oh so disappointed. Mine also came with sticker seal broken. Normally it's fine because products like these have those seals or the ring that would break off when you twist open the cap. This one didn't so I have no idea if it was ever used. And since it's going into eyes, that's kind of scary for me.<br />I did however try dispensing drops on my hand just to test the pump because I read reviews about people loving the pump. Personally, not a fan. It takes a few pumps for a droplet to drop. Usually other products would be fine after that initial pumping but this one just remained the same, needing 2-3pumps to dispense a droplet.<br />I didn't bother ordering another one because I didn't want to bother with the risk of its seal being broken again. I really nope they start using stronger seal tape that doesn't break if the box is bent or just put some tape on the bottle itself because for those who used it they say it's great.\n",
      "1153->Wrong Size, Right product! | 4 | 5 | Measure your head size accurately before-hand. I cannot stress this enough as many other users that I have spoken to have had fitment issues with numerous sizes. Seeing as the price tag is a bit steep for an improved du-rag, definitely think about this purchase. Out of the package I fell in love with the product but realizing that it was too small for me was a real heart-breaker. Although a little bummed about the fitment, I would say that I am still happy and still use the product. (Cold water soaking and a bit of use has worn it in to where I am able to wear it comfortably at home)<br />The fray in the stitching is due to me purposefully wearing in the product for comfort! Otherwise, the stitching and quality of the product was quite impressive to say the least!\n",
      "1165->Not Too Bad. | 1 | 5 | These headbands aren't bad. I kind of thought they would be better made, but I'm not too disappointed, they tend to stay in place most of the time. The different types of colors are great.<br />One good thing is they're bendable, it makes it easier to adjust for comfort or tightness.<br /><br />Update 12/02/2020.<br />I had given this headbands 3 stars, but now I'm switching it to 1 star.<br />The cloth material started to come undone after 3 uses. The material is glued on, once the ends start coming undone the material gets a sticky feeling, but won't adhere back. I tried using a bit of hot glue to fix it but didn't work, next I'll try crazy glue... we'll see.\n",
      "1166->Discontinued, don't know why | 1 | 5 | I purchased this neck cream over six months ago. Just surfin' the net about neck creams, I found that it is discontinued, and more than one site advised reading the warning on the label. There was no warning on my tube, and I no longer have the box to check.<br /><br />Anyhow, I contacted the original seller to see if they knew if I should still use this discontinued cream, for instance, if a problem had been identified with it or its ingredients. The seller emailed me back saying they had seen something about a discontinuation and possibly a warning, and gave me the phone number for BORBA. I called the number, and it is no longer in service. I checked, and it is the number on the BORBA website. Then, I went through their website email screen, filled out the information, and still haven't heard from them in almost two weeks.<br /><br />I kinda liked the feel of this cream, but no longer trust BORBA, due to the above. I do not recommend purchasing this product, because (1) it is discontinued under suspicious circumstances and (2) manufacturer is unavailable to contact by phone or email.\n",
      "1170->Naturally straight look | 1 | 5 | UPDATE: Since writing the previous five star review, the straightener stopped turning on after maybe ten uses. Currently in the process of seeking a refund.<br /><br />I'm surprisingly pleased. I have long wavy (3A) hair. And it's thick. Super thick. Like, &#34;I have to make my own ponytail holders because the regular ones aren't big enough&#34; thick. And I live in Houston where our humidity can best be described as &#34;lol good luck.&#34; Suffice to say, it's a little bit of a problem especially, during the wet season. I decided it was time to start looking a little bit more polished, and to that end I did some research and saw some really good videos on similar products and was directed here because of the low price and good ratings. Reader, it works. The temperature gauge is in celcius, but that wasn't really a problem. I used it on 205-210 and it only took me about 10 minutes to get my hair flat. And when I say &#34;flat&#34; I'm not talking about pin straight, which I had been a little afraid of. If I'd gone up to the 235 that may have happened, but 205 was just about perfect to leave my hair just a hint of a curl at the ends that looks like I intentionally put it there. I'd actually been concerned about that, because the last time I used a straightener I was in high school and I remember it gave me those super flat ends that look like you've straightened it. This is a much more natural look. I experimented with a few different things and what worked best for me was brushing my bangs straight up to give them a little more volume and then the rest of it I just brushed like it was a regular hairbrush. No sectioning hair, no going back with a curling iron to put texture back in, and no burns! The little rubber dealies do their job well, and I was able to touch them with the palm of my hand with no discomfort at all. It even got the super coarse curls around the back of my neck with no problems. I can run my fingers through my hair like a regular person without stopping to untangle anything!<br /><br />My only quibble would be that the location of the buttons (right on the handle) made it difficult to use without accidentally turning it off or adjusting the pressure, but it does make a nice loud beep when it happened so it was more of an annoyance than anything else and it may be one of those things that gets easier once you're used to it.\n",
      "1174->Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On | 5 | 5 | I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.\n",
      "1177->Not universal | 3 | 5 | I bought this after my Deva trained/curly-specialist stylist used it on my hair. It doesn't move the hair at all as it's drying, keeping down the frizz. Slightly deep, to dry more hair at a time.<br /><br />But sadly this does not fit my &#34;Revlon Perfect Heat&#34; drier. The drier's end has a ridge at the last 1&#34; or so that's smaller than the rest of the nozzle. That last inch fits, but the rest does not, so it won't stay on. This diffuser requires that more than an inch of the drier be inserted, as the rubberized treads inside that make it a flexible fit are located further down the barrel. Considering I don't have an unknown or rare brand drier, this diffuser should probably not be called universal. I considered buying the bio ionic drier to go with it, but not at that price.\n",
      "1179->NOT AS THICK IN PICTURE! | 1 | 5 | The locs were not as thick as they appear in the picture and that's very deceiving. They are very skinny and 6 packs of it probably will not look full on my head. The hair itself is nice, just wish it was as thick as it appears in the picture. Will be sending back for a refund.<br />-UPDATE 11/16/17: These people tried to talk me into leaving them a better comment in exchange for a $20 refund. For this, I'll give them 1 star. I think it's deceiving and unfair to try to sway honest customers into leaving better comments in order to trick other customers!!\n",
      "1183->Love this lotion... | 5 | 5 | This is the best glycolic acid lotion I have ever used. I have been using face acids on my face and neck for dark spots and wrinkles for many years. It feels great and it burns just a tiny bit. I thought nothing could actually make my face tingle and you only need to apply a dime size. I also<br />use a tiny amount with my eye cream. If you are not accustomed to using glycolic acid be careful with this brand. It is very potent. I suggest mixing a small amount with a moisterizer. I do that for my neck. A bit of redness and peeling is common. I will absolutely order again.\n",
      "1186->Fades, but very vibrant color | 4 | 5 | This color is pretty good for the price. There are a few pros and cons to it that I will explain below, but overall I don't think I will buy it again.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Comes with 2 containers which is enough color for any length hair<br />The ability to adjust the shade you want by adding conditioner to the color<br />A little bit goes a VERY long way<br />Price is very reasonable<br />When it fades, it fades all the way out so it doesn't look like some weird shade of orange when it starts to wash out<br />You don't need any heat to get the color to stick<br />It doesn't smell like anything<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fades INCREDIBLY fast - I had it in for maybe a week or two before it washed all the way out<br />You have to use a ton of conditioner to create a light soft pink color - the size of a dime with about 2 cups of conditioner do the trick<br />It will dye everything it comes in contact with - use thick gloves<br />If you are diluting the color with conditioner, it will take some time to sit on your hair<br />If you are diluting the color, you'll never need both bottles - it would take 5 years to use all of it<br /><br />I think overtone color conditioner is an easier system to use and the color stays longer.\n",
      "1194->Good for Mature Skin | 5 | 5 | Although I'm not thrilled that this didn't have a safety seal on it, the cream itself is very good. It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has a very high quality ingredients. But like I said, it's not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />xxoo\n",
      "1201->really helps dry nails but still gives color ! | 5 | 5 | I am a nail color addict & feel happier with a bright on my nails. I am also health oriented & don't want to put toxic stuff on me. I was recovering from using the llght cure color gels. My nails were especially dry& peeling. I use all the  supporting products with this. For me it stays on as well or better than other color brands, goes on smoothly with a pretty good shine to finish & dries quicker than others I've tried. It wears well. No smell.<br /> I'm finally coming to terms with the idea that if a polish is  stronger than a healthy fingernail it will damage a fingernail, healthy or not. I write that because in my eternal quest for chip free polish, I forgot to respect that a healthy fingernail is not supposed to be some diamond strong plate to be misused as a screwdriver! I need to wear gloves for any activity that's tough enough to damage a good, healthy fingernail.<br />As to specific color: it's a cream, medium, slighty warm, pink that's bright enough for toes but still not &#34;fluorescent&#34; or &#34;beachy.&#34; I have fair olive skin tone & i\n",
      "1202->The brush works fine. But if I would have known | 2 | 5 | I didn't know about the tacky printing on the face of the brush.<br />The brush works fine.  But if I would have known, or if they had posted a photo of what the front of the brush looks like, I NEVER would have ordered.<br />On the front in BIG while tacky block letters it says;&#34;My Favorite Brush&#34;.  It's just soon tacky.<br />I've added a photo.\n",
      "1203->Great, but... | 3 | 5 | You know, I gifted these handcreams. They came in such a nice set I was able to put a few in gift bags and gift them to several people. They smell beautiful and my daughter, who was one of the recipients, let me try one. These are thick and seriously moisturizing. So ... why the 3 stars?<br /><br />The name Difeel Organic is a bit misleading.  While there ARE organic ingredients in the product, there are a lot of non-organic ingredients in them as well. In fact, the creams contain TRICLOSAN, which has been FDA-banned and many manufacturers have removed it in their products due to consumer awareness. I am embarrassed that I gifted these when I should have read the label. So the fault is mine for not reading all the ingredients before purchasing, but the product should be made with better ingredients when you have a name like Difeel Organics.\n",
      "1206->Great palette. | 5 | 5 | I ordered this palette in the 15 shade option. I wasn't expecting much from this makeup palette but I was wrong. Now granted, I cannot use most of the colors as I am super fair-skinned but I am able to use most of the left side of the palette.<br /><br />First, I have terrible dark circles. They are sort of a reddish-brown color. The yellow in this palette conceals them better than any skin-toned concealer I have ever tried. It not only covers but also brightens the area too. I also have a brownish spot on my cheek that bothers me every time I look in the mirror. I have tried everything to cover it. I went to a department store makeup counter hoping they could cover it. The makeup counter girl tried for what seemed like an eternity to no avail. She called her manager over to assess my situation. The manager tried to cover it as well, packing more and more concealer and powder but she also could not cover it. She finally said that it was texture and you cannot cover texture. It sounded like a copout to me. It has no texture, it is just a spot. When I apply the yellow in this kit is does wonders for the spot. It is barely noticeable, almost not at all which is better results than I have gotten in the past.<br /><br />I use the green to cover redness that I have around my cheeks and nose area. I just make sure to blend really well and then put foundation over it to get rid of the green. The purple is used to brighten your complexion. Just like with the green, I blend it well and cover with foundation.<br /><br />The best color that matches my skin tone for concealing is the color directly to the right of the purple. For reference I wear MAC Matchmaster SPF 15 Foundation 1.0. Nine times out of ten I am the lightest shade in any foundation. This color matches and is great at concealing.<br /><br />The darker shades are good for contouring but I prefer to use powder contour rather than cream, just a personal preference.<br /><br />Overall I really like this kit. It does a great job of concealing areas that are a constant bother to me. I am including photos of before and afters of my dark circles and the dark spot on my cheek. Hopefully they come out well and you can see the difference.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

      "1211->it worked excellent at the highest temperature setting | 4 | 5 | A few months back a friend of mine styled my hair with a product similar to this which cost three times the cost. I was thrilled with the results, and wanted one for myself, but just couldn't see spending so much money on something that I'd rarely use. Imagine my surprise when I found this one online for a fraction of the price!<br /><br />So does it work is probably all that you're concerned about. In one word: YES! I actually put this to the test of &quot;only 8 seconds&quot; to style! I put it at only 200% during my test, which is almost half of the reccomend end temperature for my hair type. I did this to give the product a true test. Sure, it worked excellent at the highest temperature setting, but what snoot those who don't want too much heat damage? Well, I'm happy to report that even at half the heat, and at only 8 seconds, this product worked beautifully! Wow! I simply did slow strokes through each section of my hair and the outcome was beautiful!<br />Now, with the test at full temperature and longer than 8 seconds, well that came out just as great as a flat iron. I found that this unit glided freely through my hair with minimal pulling. I passed the brush through each section slowly 2-3 times each. In the end my hair was shiny, smooth, and full of life!<br />The bristle portion is far safer than a traditional flat iron as well. The cord is extremely thick, and the unit has a nice weight to it. The temperature is easily adjusted by pressing the buttons next to the led display.<br />In conclusion: for a girl with extremely long straight hair, this unit performed beautifully. Sure, it takes a bit more work than a straight iron since heat is only being applied from one side as opposed to two. However, my hair was able to keep its bounce because of it! My hair is always so stiff after a use with an iron, not so with this brush. I highly approve. Sample provided for evaluation.\n",
      "1213->The package is nice. | 2 | 5 | All four colors are orangey--just to different degrees. The tube seals are very difficult to  remove.<br />The lip gloss has an odd odor.\n",
      "1231->Overrated | 2 | 5 | Mild, pleasant scent, warm vanilla.<br />Found product highly overrated.<br />Moderate suds.<br />No more effective than store bought for deodorizing properties.<br />Would NOT buy this $pendy product again.\n",
      "1233->Love the #5 rosy brown color!! | 4 | 5 | I’ve purchased this Kiko Milano eyeshadow stick in two colors from different amazon sellers. This one #5 (rosy brown) and the #7 (golden beige). I really loved the #5 color. It’s a beautiful neutral that can be applied darker or lighter depending on your preference. It also has obvious glitter particles which I like in comparison to solely “shimmer”. It is very blendable with your finger or brush.<br /><br />I did notice some differences between the two colors I purchased, but I’m not sure if it is a consistent shade problem or if I just purchased an older #7. The #7 I purchased was much drier and did not apply as smoothly as the #5. I did also experience glitter fall out which I did not experience with the #5 color.<br /><br />I’m rating this #5 color with 4 stars because it met my expectations but I think there are other products that are slightly more expensive with higher quality. Overall I would recommend but be aware that there might be some differences across shades/sellers.\n",
      "1234->Great Product | 5 | 5 | This is a great product.  It goes on smoothly and does not leave any greasy residue.  My skin feels so soft and clean to the touch.  It really does seem to minimize lines and wrinkles too.  I am 68 so I did not expect miracles but I must say, this cream does make my skin look younger and more supple.  I have tried other moisturizing facial creams and the others either seemed to do nothing or left my skin feeling oily.  Love that it is SPF 15 also since I use it all year but do add more stronger sun screen in the summer on top of this.<br /><br />I have kind of combination skin on my face.  Most areas are normal but I do have a few dry spots on my cheek and nose.  This softens the dry spots and does not make the normal skin feel icky like some do.  Love it!\n",
      "1237->it looks very pretty in my natural reddish hair | 5 | 5 | Designer Fashion Elastic Rhinestone Hairtie...<br />I wanted a hair tie for an adult to wear in the evening.  This fits that bill and when my hair dresser puts it on me; it looks very pretty in my natural<br />reddish hair.  I like it very much and would not hesitate buying it again.\n",
      "1245->1 fix and it’ll be perfect | 4 | 5 | This has clean and good quality stones, feels great on skin, and rolls smoothly. The box and little pouch are a nice touch and the guide is so helpful!<br /><br />Just like the update, they added the plastic cap, which works perfectly to protect the inside of the stone and stop the squeaky noise. And they welded the metal on the big side of the roller so it’s sturdy. BUT unfortunately not the smaller side, so it fell right off when I just got it. I don’t mind putting superglue on myself, but I gotta take 1 star off for that.<br /><br />This a pretty good buy for its price. Just hope they fix the smaller side of the roller too.\n",

Just order a few more bars for now.<br /><br />Ok, it took a while but I'm starting to really like this bar.\n",
      "1262->Nice soaps. The smells aren't quite as powerful as ... | 4 | 5 | Nice soaps. The smells aren't quite as powerful as Dr. Bronners, but are ever much as good. Ha svery tiny microsuds which make skin feel soft even when dry.<br />The citrus smells like orange peel.<br />The lavender smells spot on like fresh lavender and not overpowering or artificial like other products tend to be.<br />The peppermint isn't as potent as Dr. Bronners in smell or in tinglieness from the mint, but its still effective..<br />The tea tree presumably smells like tea tree, I have no first hand experience but its not bad.<br />I made a blend of the first three with some water for a hand pump by the sink and just really enjoy washing my hands a lot more now.<br />Nice variety pack and good way to pick your favorite flavor or make some blends easily.\n",
      "1279->Love Love Love | 5 | 5 | This stuff is the truth! I put on a base coat of any brand polish. Then I use two coats of nail color. After that dries I seal the color with the 3 minute artificial. I brush a coat across the top of my nail tip, then a coat across the top of my nail (as if doing a French manicure), then I polish the rest of my nail....sealing in the color. I have natural nails and this helps my polish lasts all week.<br />My only problem is that I do not understand why it is so expensive on this site. I get mine from a 'W'ell known big box store and pay about $3.\n",
      "1284->No house with children should ever go without these! | 5 | 5 | Update: My son had a fever of 102.9 earlier this evening.  We still had hours before we could give any oral meds and we're getting concerned.  Within 15 min his fever went down to 102.5 and continued to go down to 102.3.  Not only did it keep it down but it helped us make it to the next dosage of oral meds and we were so relieved!  Love this product!<br /><br />We LOVE these and ALWAYS have them around the house for when our son gets a fever.  They help bring the fever down in between doses of Tylenol.  They also help bring down a high fever a few more degrees. Our house will NEVER be without!\n",
      "1291->this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow, absorbs well, hydrates, non greasy | 5 | 5 | Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, \"medium\" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, \"a sun kissed glow\".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the \"medium\" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a \"sun kissed glow\". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.\n",
      "1295->Not tough enough for manicure but great for pedicure. | 3 | 5 | Great for pedi but not tough enough for mani - discoloration on nails is clearing up after using this brand exclusively for about 8 weeks.<br />Jen C\n",
      "1297->Good for long hair, difficult at times for short hair | 4 | 5 | I love this flat iron despite the one problem I have with it. I wish that the flat iron was skinnier. It’s difficult to get close to my head at certain angles due the flat iron size. If my hair was longer, this would not be a problem. I almost returned the product because of the iron size. But I made some changes to the way that I iron my hair & I think it will work despite the iron size.<br />The features I like about it:<br />-steam feature - makes my frizzy hair smoother than a normal flat iron does<br />-high temperature adjustable heat - makes it so I can iron my hair with less passes from the iron, even if my hair is wet when I’m ironing it - my hair is thick and usually requires more passes, even from a high heat iron, and I have never been able to dry my wet hair by ironing it with any other flat iron in the past<br />-setting buttons are on the inside handle - I was annoyed with this feature at first, but I realized that this makes it safer to leave plugged in when not in use, when you have small children - I have not had the problems I have had in the past with my kids trying to play with the buttons because of their location<br />-comes with quite a few extra tools including an extra steam compartment and an easy way to fill the steam compartment - the holes for the filling the steam compartment are really small and would be impossible to fill without provided bottle<br />-comes with chord Velcro strap - this makes it easy to keep organized despite having a long chord in a small bathroom<br /><br />Despite my problem with the short hair, I decided to keep it because it works so well. I will also say that I don’t believe the steam feature is protective to hair damage. It just makes the flat iron way more affective with less passes.\n",
      "1298->Love these paper sheet masks, but pricier than others | 4 | 5 | These are pricier than other compressed facial masks, but they have the advantage of prime shipping (as opposed to 2-3 weeks for international shipping) and of being individually wrapped. I wanted to try making my own masks asap, and also want to take these when I travel and to throw in beauty gifts (spa in a jar) for friends and family. So the fast shipping and individually wrapped masks were worth paying more for me.<br /><br />I love the concept of soaking these in whatever you like, or placing over a mud mask so that my skin can soak up the benefits and detoxify without drying out too fast. However, these are a bit too small for me width-wise and definitely too small for my hubby (who is willing to sheet mask with me!).  I'll probably buy these again just because I can easily travel with them and use in gifts, but I am going to look for larger ones that I can use on a more regular basis. And once you see the difference sheet masking can do for your skin, you might just look forward to using these as often as you can! I know I do!<br /><br />(I found a really good recipe to brighten and moisturize the face: one egg white, teaspoon of honey, and the juice of a lemon/lime slice. Whisk it together, or shake in a jar, and dab all over your face. Then soak your mask in it and place on your face. It feels sooo good! And is cheap :)\n",
      "1307->DO NOT USE IN SUNLIGHT!!! | 3 | 5 | I just received the rose scented chapstick and I must say that it smells awful. Doesn’t smell like rose AT ALL. I read the ingredients and realized that this has retinal palmitate (vitamin a). I’ve been warned by my dermatologist to avoid retinol in the sun. The EWG warns against Retin Palminate specifically. I thought this was going to be a stellar product as it was endorsed by Gin Amber. She said it smells lovely so I wonder if this product is a knock off. If you’re curious about retinal under sun exposure just google it yourself or ask your dermatologist. As for me I won’t be using this during the day. Super disappointed.<br /><br />The only good things about the product are that it does feel nice, it doesn’t taste bad and if you’re looking for anti-aging the retinol is good for that. So for me it’s a 50/50 overall. Really wish it actually smelled nice.<br /><br />I will add that I generally really like Camille Beckham products. I used to work in a hospital and handled paper all day. It sucked the moisture right out of my skin and those products were the ONLY thing that saved my hands. Everyone in the office kept trying to take my lotion. So while I feel let down my this particular product I still like other items.\n",
      "1308->It doesn't work! | 1 | 5 | I'm so disappointed.  This thing doesn't even work!  The packaging says there should be epsom salt included.  There wasn't.  I'm not concerned with that, I have my own anyway.  But the remote doesn't work so I can't even turn the thing on!  What a bummer.<br /><br />I may try to buy a new battery and hope that solves the issue, but for the price, I expected this thing to work out of the box.\n",
      "1310->Easy, but has drawbacks | 3 | 5 | The eyeliner is flaky so that’s a bummer- they are super easy to use and honestly- they look awesome.<br />If you have very delicate eyes I would reconsider wearing the eyeliner. I only tried a couple pair, but my eyes did get a bit itchy. The eyeliner feels heavy.<br /><br />Update 6/29/20<br />I don’t know if it’s just the way this year is going, but the more I try to love this, the more they annoy me. They work for about an hour and then the eyeliner comes off the eyelid. In clumps. Like peeling asbestos (or what I imagine asbestos looks like).<br />I love the way they look, but for some reason they don’t last long. The ends begin to detach.\n",
      "1311->Bogus | 1 | 5 | As an owner of the previous model without the vacuum, I was looking forward to this new purchase. Bah. This item is heavier, noisier and more inconvenient than its predecessor. And for practically no gain! This shaver catches maybe 10% of the clipped hair with the rest of it flying all over the sink.<br /><br />Stay away from this model.<br /><br />Update: I've owned Norelco trimmers in the past, however based on my experience with this particular model, my next trimmer will NOT be a Norelco. The fan which drives the vaccuum rattles against the plastic housing, making a hideous noice while I'm trimming. The vaccuum action is terrible; hairs don't make it down into the receptacle, causing constant blockage. This in turn, scatters hair all over the place, worse than any conventional non-vac trimmer I've ever owned. (And no, my beard is not especially thick either.) I've finally had it with this model. I'm about to order a new trimmer on Amazon. No, it won't be a Norelco.\n",
      "1312->thick and itchy... | 3 | 5 | I bought quite a few packages of these. I got brown, blonde, and platinum and teal.<br /><br />CONS-First off, I didn't use the platinum because of how synthetic and plastic looking they looked to me.  So I stuck to the other three colors. My hair was shoulder length at this time- (was).<br />After having these in my hair ONE day and working ALL day to get them in,I was woken in the middle of night by so much itching that clearly I was allergic or something to them. I had to remove them all in the middle of night, and doing so broke all the hair off on my bottom layer because of the rubber bands ripping my hair (I now have a short hairstyle).<br />Also, I tried all the heating tricks to get them to soften and it works for like a few hours and then once dried it goes back to being oddly stiff and weird looking, to were styling and sleeping with them in was near impossible.<br /><br />PROS- they looked cool, and everyone in my family thought they were pretty cool looking. Just wish they weren't so stiff and synthetic looking.\n",
      "1314->Perfect Gift Set | 5 | 5 | I'm a true skincare addict. I really like these holiday sets. They're a good way to try new products. Caudalie is a cult favorite for a reason. Their products are made from the grapes in their vineyards. You get all the benefits of the resveratrol in pretty packaging. This set comes with a moisturizer, serum and foaming cleanser. They come in travel sizes, so it's just enough to decide whether you like them or not. This set is a great value. It makes the perfect gift. As a note, my box was a bit banged up. The products weren't properly glued to the base, so they came out in the shipping package. Other than that, I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",

      "1320->The Sapphire Collection...Confusion | 2 | 5 | I hope this gets to the right person who in charge of answering questions.<br /> I've used this before and hopefully it's doing a good job. I just purchased more of the product for Fiber Water Beds from Amazon.com.<br /><br />My question is the DIRECTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE WHAT SIZE WATERBED THE PRODUCT IS BEING USED IN. HOW MUCH TO USE FOR A KING SIZE BED VS. A SINGLE BED?<br /><br />The Blue Sapphire liquid comes in 4 oz and 8 oz bottles. and my OLDER bottle says Multi purpose Plus and it's not on the NEW bottle. Also my older bottle says \"fulll motion and fiber-fill\" and the new bottle says time released water bed protection. The NEW one ,from Amazon also has a serial number on it and the old does not.<br />PG01127006 is the number on the new bottle and says Wasserbett Conditioner and states for Fiberbeds to repeat application every 4 to 6 months .<br /><br />My older bottle, which I purchased at a waterbed store(which is now closed and there are none near me0, says REVITALISANT Pour lit D'eau and says repeat application every 8 to 12 months.<br />This is quite confusing and I would like you as the manufacturer to CLEARIFY THE INFORMATION.\n",
      "1324->Works great, a little hard to attach | 5 | 5 | This wonderful product allowed me to continue using my favorite T3 Featherweight blowdryer with my new Xtava Black Orchid diffuser!! I didn't have to buy a new blowdryer! I will admit that I measured the wrong thing when I ordered the SnozzlePro adapter (I measured the base of the concentrator nozzle that came with the blowdryer and not the actual blowdryer nozzle - oops!) My blowdryer is actually a little wider than the measurements given for the SnozzlePro. It was so close, I was determined to make it work! I was able to do it with a little manipulation and a slender tool to give just a little extra stretch to get the SnozzlePro over the end of the blowdryer nozzle (used a tool WITHOUT any sharp edges or points, nothing that could damage the SnozzlePro or the blowdryer). **I did this at my own risk - knowing that I could possibly damage the SnozzlePro or my blowdryer!!** Very gently, I was able to get the SnozzlePro onto my blowdryer. I made sure it was evenly attached all the way around before adding the Xtava Black Orchid diffuser. I attached the diffuser to the SnozzlePro AFTER I put the SnozzlePro on the blowdryer - the opposite of what the instructions advise you to do. (also note that before attaching the SnozzlePro to the blowdryer, I put the diffuser on the SnozzlePro a couple of times to make sure it fit properly and that I would be able to attach it without needing to use the other end of the adapter to make sure it was secure).  After getting everything in place, I'm happy to say that it's very secure and there's nothing that is loose or has any wiggle room whatsoever!! I'm never removing it!! It's there until the dryer kicks the bucket or something breaks! It's working beautifully! It holds very tightly and securely, it hasn't slipped or moved at all since I attached everything!! You can see in the pics how tightly it's holding. I love drying my hair with this diffuser! My hair looks amazing and dries faster than when I used to use a round brush! No more work drying with a round brush! Just using this diffuser and moving it to different sections of my hair, it's easier than ever to dry my hair! Thank you for making this product that allows us to use this wonderful diffuser on other brands of blowdryers! I will be recommending it to everyone who has curly hair!<br /><br />Update - the adapter and diffuser has come off a couple of times and it takes a little bit of work to get it back on because my blow dryer is a tiny bit bigger than the measurements but I can get it back on. I think it came off because I accidentally held it by the adapter or grabbed it by the diffuser. Definitely only hold it by the barrel of the blow dryer (like in my 3rd pic) or the handle for the blow dryer!\n",
      "1327->Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub | 4 | 5 | I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so.  As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off.  If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too.  The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want.  Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off.  Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful.  However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.\n",
      "1330->Light Cream, Good for Day Use | 3 | 5 | This light cream has a lovely, not-too-heavy scent, and smooths onto my skin quite easily.  There is no draggy feeling as with heavier creams.  And that is both a plus and a negative.  While I like this for daytime because it doesn't feel greasy, it does not feel hydrating enough for night time, at least not for my old skin.  I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although \"cruelty free\" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter.  Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.\n",
      "1339->Great If You Want A Slime Factory - But There's a Cure | 2 | 5 | Despite rinsing and wiping the exterior of this unit after each use, a pool of slime soon forms in the charging base.  It's even worse inside the top of the handle, visible when the brushing element is unscrewed.  If you want to avoid a disgusting mess, you really need to disassemble this unit every day for a thorough cleaning.  That's a lot to ask for a tool that is supposed to make our lives easier.  I used a previous Sonicare model for years without ever encountering this issue.  My wife's toothbrush is identical to mine, and it has exactly the same problem, so there's pretty obviously a serious design flaw with this model.<br /><br />A CHEAP FIX:  The problem is that the gaskets in the brush head don't seal out liquids.  One possible solution is a product called \"Sonic Seal\" [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads (3 Pack of Blue, Pink, Frost)]] available on Amazon -- currently 3 for $16.95.  Pretty expensive for what's essentially a toothbrush condom, so I tried making my own in three easy steps. (1) Take a latex glove and cut off one of the fingers. (2) Cut off a very tiny section at the end of the detached fingertip (the resulting small hole will stretch temporarily in the next step). (3) Slip the glove finger down over the brush head, leaving the tip end above the top gasket of the brush head, and pulling the rest of the latex down to where the brush head joins the handle. Voila, no more slime build-up.  (Keep the glove on hand in case you have to make more protectors later on.)\n",
      "1340->Okay, but maybe not for my type? | 3 | 5 | It smells good, but I think the extra elasticity didn't help for the type of leg hair I have. It worked better for the fine hairs, but less so for the thicker/darker ones. Unfortunately those are the ones I really wanted it to work on!<br /><br />I think I'll stick to the blue beads for coarse hair.\n",
      "1342->Its ok, but better than activator brand. as far as durability. | 3 | 5 | The plastic wrap handles keep coming off. This equipment feels more comfortable than my Activator ($149 version). But does not feel as well made.<br /><br />Update: after over two years of usage this has outlasted my activator brand tool. one of the things that I do not like about this tool is that you have to keep readjusting after a few clicks.\n",
      "1345->Comedogenic | 2 | 5 | Update: unfortunately I had to change my 5 star review due to the fact that the first ingredient is highly comedogenic. I am so sad. I really loved the look of this.<br /><br />Wow this is the best foundation I have ever used. I am so impressed. It’s easy to apply, the perfect color, the coverage is amazing, and it lasts all day. It makes my face look flawless and supple.\n",
      "1353->You're not fully clean, til you're zestfully clean! | 5 | 5 | Favorite soap & love the new bigger bars, my husband goes thru the reg size bars much too quickly, so these last longer between having to get out a new bar!<br />Longtime zest fan of over 20 yrs, nothing smells as simple, fresh & clean or rinses as well, especially when you have soft water!<br />Love being zestfully clean!\n",
      "1355->I was disappointed that the applicator tip isn't as fine as I ... | 3 | 5 | I was disappointed that the applicator tip isn't as fine as I had hoped.  It is more of a felt tip applicator.  I also found that I needed a couple of applications to get the color I wanted.  Since the applicator is thicker it left uncovered spots so I needed to go over the uncovered areas.  After a few uses I finally was able to get a finer line, but I haven't been able to apply on the bottom of the eye to get the fine line.  I'll continue working with it but I'm not sure at this time that I would buy again.<br /><br />On the plus side since this is a natural product my eyes didn't swell or turn pink by the end of the day!\n",
      "1359->OUCH! | 2 | 5 | I have fine, thick hair that is almost waist length and when I put my hair up in one of these, at first I really liked it. It's nice not to have to go around your hair multiple times like I have to with most scruchi/elastic type holders.<br /><br />Unfortunately, getting this out of my long hair was AWFUL. There's simply no way to get this out of your hair without it rolling and when it does, it takes hair with it until I had a mess that required a pair of scissors and my husband's help to get it out without ripping out lots of hair. I stretched the band out as best I could while my husband clipped it with the scissors and thankfully only clipped the band and not my hair.<br /><br />I think these would probably be fine with shorter hair but with my long hair, it just rolled it right up into a snarl.<br /><br />Normally I really like this brand and I've bought lots of their products but this just wasn't for me.\n",
      "1361->Coating flakes off after 1st use | 2 | 5 | The clips do well in holding up hair.  However, the color of the hair clips appears to be delivered with some coating that does not hold up well at all.<br /><br />After the first use of placing in hair, the coating started to come loose and chip off near the opening/tips of the teeth.  I thought this flaw may have only impacted one of the clips, but every single one I've used had done this.<br /><br />I would have returned these, but the return window closed on the item before I had a chance to check a 2nd one.\n",
      "1370->Not Very Pigmented | 3 | 5 | Like all the different tones, blushes, bronzers and highlighters are all in one collection. The brushes are ok.<br />Eyeshadows aren't too pigmented but that's ok. Love the blushes and highlighers\n",
      "1371->Good body wash but the scent is very low | 4 | 5 | As most my reviews on body wash, I always state; hard water takes more soap then moderate to soft water, to lather. In this case, I can use very little, like maybe a bit less than a table spoon on my loofah (yes I do use one) and can lather this Greek bod from toes to head no problem.<br /><br />The smell is there but for me, not very strong at all.  I like the scent and whish it was a bit stronger. This is not a deodorant soap, so it does not leave a scent on the skin after drying off. Though it does clean very well and rinses off with ease. There is no after slime or weird tacky feeling. The soap does have beads in it, so if you are a hands and soap person, you will like that.<br /><br />The scent is difficult to describe so I won't try..<br /><br />This stuff will last a long time as it takes very little, for medium water, not hard or soft water, just in the middle, to lather and clean.\n",
      "1378->lightweight, budget friendly, soothing cica cream, use all over | 4 | 5 | Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.\n",
      "1381->Smells like coffee grounds and orange powder, because it is! | 2 | 5 | I have long hair and I try not to wash it for 7 days.  Recently my regular dry shampoo was unavailable, so I gave this a try.  It said it had a strong odor, but since it mentioned cocoa and orange, I thought I would love it.<br /><br />It came; I tried it for two weeks.  I used it sparingly the first week and didn't look like it was helping.  I ended up washing my hair every 3 days.  In the second week, I started using more, it did seem a little better until day 5, when I scratched my head and got dark brown junk under my nails.  After inspecting my scalp in the mirror, I found the powder had coated my skin and it looked orange!  There was quite a build up.  I wash my hair immediately and re-inspected it.  I still had some visible!  I had to rewash and carefully comb my whole scalp to get it all out.<br /><br />Afterwards, my husband said he was glad I threw it away because I was starting to smell profusely of coffee and he could no longer smell my perfume.  Currently trying another brand.\n",
      "1395->Super vibrant, perfect for summer | 4 | 5 | I bought this on a whim, there were no reviews on it but I really wanted a bright red orange tint for summer.<br /><br />This is definitely a vibrant red orange! If you like more natural looking lip tints, this is not gonna be for you, this is a true Korean style vivid lip color. I love it!<br /><br />It's gonna perfect for the hotter months and to bring some life to my face whenever I do simple makeup looks. If you like K-Beauty looks with the bright lip, I recommend this tint for sure.\n",
      "1398->Little Jar | 2 | 5 | Tiny Jar<br />wish it was Larger<br />product is ok<br />used for couple days almost gone dont See much of a result yet<br />not sure would re purchase\n",
      "1410->Cooling and Refreshing-Perfect for Summer! | 5 | 5 | I must admit that I was somewhat hesitant to try this product, thinking that it would leave a greasy feeling on my skin.  Not so!  This cooling, soothing gel is absorbed quickly, leaving a light, refreshing fragrance behind.  It is the perfect solution for those hot, summer days, especially after a shower.  No matter how high the temperature (even 90+ days) there is an immediate cooling sensation that is nothing short of pure delight.<br /><br />One other concern I had was that this product might result in dry skin.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised.  My skin feels soft, supple and hydrated.  In hot weather, it beats out regular lotions hands down.  I sincerely recommend this to any woman who not only wants to produce a cooling sensation on her body as the temperatures soar but also experience a gel that moisturizes without the greasiness of some lotions or the drying effects of alcohol based skin products.  This is a home run for the Vaseline Intensive Care line!\n",
      "1411->Pack of lies | 1 | 5 | So I will admit that the product works well. It does it's job as a body wash. The reason that this is getting one star is due to something I am seeing a few others have noticed. Which is that this bottle does not contain what it is supposed to. I looked up every ingredient listed on the back of this bottle. Some of them are things derived from coconut oil. However actual coconut oil is not an actual ingredient. There is nothing that I can find that says that this stuff has argan oil. Lastly is that supposedly has tea tree oil. I didn't even need to look anything up to know that this body wash does not have it in there. The big one being that, while the soap smells nice, it smells NOTHING like tee tree oil. Tea Tree oil has a very strong and distinct smell. I use it for a lot of stuff, so I know what it smells like. Then there is the fact that based off of glancing at the ingredients. Tea Tree oil is not listed by it's common or scientific name. So unless this company is counting the front of the bottle as part of the ingredients list, this does not contain what it says it does. There ingredients seem natural enough and the ingredients list isn't as long as a lot of soaps, I do not appreciate being mislead and lied to.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If for any reason my opinion of the product should change, I will edit my review to reflect that change.\n",
      "1416->Not really SHEER | 5 | 5 | These can be used as SHEER colors. Of this group, only the &#34;Sheer Peach&#34; remains so after a second color coat.<br />These are really 2 groups. I call them Pink and  Peach. I like them even though I don't consider them to actually be SHEER.\n",
      "1417->Didn't work as expected but GREAT Customer Service! | 3 | 5 | Pro: Awesome Customer service! I would be happy to purchase from this seller again!<br /><br />Con: These forms are difficult to stay on my fingers and so they paint gets stuck on them and pulls off my finish<br />before I can get the polish to dry.<br />Good idea, poor design.\n",
      "1418->Time will tell... | 1 | 5 | It’s been a week and my husbands teeth are exactly the same..<br /> No discernible change as yet but will use till product is gone to give it a fair shake\n",
      "1426->Purchased for mild IV, probably wouldn't buy again. | 3 | 4 | I purchased this soap after reading reviews that it's beneficial for IV. I have mild IV and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Three stars for the following: delicious fragrance; luxurious dried flowers mixed throughout; skin softening; washes clean without much effort.<br /><br />Minus two stars for the following: dissolves too rapidly in the shower, even when not directly under the water; price.<br /><br />I followed the directions of another reviewer and cut the soap into slivers as not to prematurely dissolve the entire bar. I was able to use each sliver (maybe 1/6 to 1/4 inch thick) ONCE before it completely disintegrated. That means that I used the entire bar of soap in about 6 showers. Disappointing.<br /><br />For $11 per soap, I would expect a longer lasting product. Yes, it softened my skin, and yes it smells great. Also a plus that it's natural. I didn't see a significant improvement simply from the soap alone though.<br /><br />Note -- for IV people, try out Dermal Therapy brand lotion. That's a product that is DEFINITELY worth the money.\n",
      "1428->Some directions would be nice | 4 | 4 | I am not entirely sure how long to soak these for, or how long they are good for in a sealed bag.<br /><br />So, I soaked them overnight, and then threw them in my blend.  I have been out of town for a few weeks, so I am looking forward to opening the bag when I get home to see the state of my leaf.<br /><br />I am hoping these do the trick.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/21/14:  So, I have been out of town for about 5 weeks, came home, opened up my blend and it's nice and moist.  I took out the moisture button and shook it, the disc on the inside moved around indicating that it was at least dryer than when I put it in.  So, I would say that these things have spared me from buying an oz. or two every time I come home.\n",
      "1430->Comes with a wig cap and Bobby pins | 5 | 4 | I was really skeptical when I first purchased this because there is no reviews but since I received it I am really happy with the product! The hair is very thick and beautiful and shiny but not too shiny where it looks to fake but you can always spray some dry shampoo on it to help with that shininess. I was very surprised to receive the package and it came with the wig which is wrapped in a hairnet keep it from tingling in the box and also came with a package of bobby pins and a wig cap which I was worried I had a purchase in addition to this but I'm so glad that it came with it.<br /><br />The wig at edge of your hairline does look fake and it could be hard to work with but I think you could definitely wear it with a  baseball cap or a beanie over this week and it would look really cute which is how I plan on wearing it. I love the stone gray color it's not too light and silvery but it's a very nice toned down gray and it's so beautiful as you can see in the pictures it's very long .. comes down to about my mid back and it doesn't tangle that easily which is nice. It's very bouncy and I love it!! I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a long gray wig.<br /><br />I did purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "1431->Fantastic! | 5 | 4 | This 6-head Suttik replaces what seems like an identical motor version with 5-heads. This breed of shavers is the first I've ever used in the steamy hot AM shower every day. Day after day. What a time saver! It does a fantastic job. It delivers a better shave than my really high-$ screen shaver.<br /><br />6 heads is an improvement over 5. First, it simply covers more area. This is your head ---> a spheroid with protuberances. The 6-head shaver conforms to stuff like your ears and jawline better. 6-heads get the cutter closer to the nooks and crannies where those obnoxious thickets of long hairs might survive for a couple of days before someone points and say, \"Ewee!\"<br /><br />The shaver is small and easy to hold. A charge lasts more than a month. Cleaning is easy. I use shaving cream to lubricate, just like a regular razor. A 'dry' shave in the shower might sound like an oxymoron, but you'll know what I mean when you use it once.<br /><br />I'm sold. Adds at least 5-minutes of goof-off time in my morning routine. I'll take every minute I can gather. Perseverance might payoff with a straight razor shave, but the time saved here to goof off in the AM pays off immediately!<br /><br />It's revolutionary.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click \"Helpful\" so I can know.\n",
      "1437->Works, but you have to have realistic expectations | 4 | 4 | I have abundant, thick, coarse, wavy hair. I have done it all to tame the volume and sponginess of it, but finally gave up as it was too time consuming. I have very little time to get ready in the morning before heading out to work, so I bought this brush to try it, since I am always looking for a solution. Now the verdict:<br /><br />It works well as long as you are not looking for a fast miracle. It heats up quickly and and goes through your hair like a regular brush. It dies tame unruly hair and gave me a flatish look very quickly, I went through my entire hair in less than four minutes and my back of the head volume went down and the sponge &#34;pyramid&#34; went down. I ended my few minutes long styling with balm and there! I looked human again and it lasted all day. My hair feels silkier and definitely looks like I spent more time styling it, but not salon styled of course. It suits my needs so I am keeping it. I would say it gives 68 percent flat hair, which is a good result considering the time invested, If you want to look like Hollywood star or the girl in the advertisement of the product, this is not for you, and you will need to go to 30 minutes blow dry and 30'minutes flat ironing if you want flat straight perfect results.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Attractive packaging<br />-It works if you have reasonable expectations<br />- Fast fair to good results<br /><br />Cons<br />- Product looks cheap and chintzy<br />- The brush's bristles are made out of very hard plastic, ouch!<br />- No glove included, although the handle doesn't get hot<br /><br />I am satisfied with the results. Now I can go to work without looking like a mop everyday. Whenever I want my tresses to look flat, I would use my flat iron, but for every day, go and run quick styling, this seem like a good compromise. Hope it lasts as it looks like a cheap price of Chinese rubbish.\n",

      "1443->Effective and easy to use | 5 | 4 | [[VIDEOID:8c55153397d3655b2c7f6b8b134d5bc8]] This is a great product. Easy to use.  I used latisse for many months and  this is almost as effective but at a much cheaper price. Plus it doesn't make the area where I apply it  itchy like other brands do. My eyelashes are longer, but not thicker so I knocked off one star. Buy it!!!<br />Update- Sept 13- Eyelashes are a bit thicker too. Some itching occasionally on my eyelashes for a few minutes after I apply it. But they are slightly longer and slightly thicker!!! So I have changed it to 5 starts. The effect is subtle and natural, not like having fake bushy eye lashes so please have realistic expectations or you will be disappointed\n",
      "1444->Well packaged | 4 | 4 | It smells so good, can’t wait to try it.<br />Well packaged.\n",
      "1453->Easily to apply and you get 50 of them! | 3 | 4 | Just like my title says, they are easy to apply. The instructions tell you to wet the actual strip and then put it on your face, but I recommend keeping the strip dry and just lightly wet the area around your nose. I tried both ways and for some reason, wetting my face just worked much nicer. You also get 50 of them so thats a huge plus considering the price.<br /><br />Now the big question.....do they work?<br />Well. When I used it the two times, it dude pull out some small blackheads and looked like it did a decent job. I've always been a little skeptical of these kinds of products and I don't feel like it does that much in general. I kind of use these for placebo and catharsis. It's comforting to see these strips pull ANYTHING out of your skin, so it makes me feel better about it. But it is completely acne-clearing and black head cleansing? Not really.<br /><br />These are inexpensive, you get a bunch of them, and they are nice to use. I recommend it but if you have somewhat large pores and oily skin like me, don't expect much passed &#34;Oh.....well that's nice.&#34; I wish it did more. But these are okay.\n",
      "1461->My Skincare regime goes a little like: cleanser | 5 | 4 | My Skincare regime goes a little like: cleanser, thayers witch hazel rose toner, the ordinary caffeine solution, the ordinary niacinamide (this product), and then I wrap it up with a heavy moisturizer (dry skin).<br /><br />I love this product. I've seen such an improvement with texture and color related to my skin. I used to have a lot of redness around my nose and my general t-zone area, just where my skins seemed to always be more &#34;flush&#34;, and after 3 or 4 weeks of consistent use, I'm amazed at the difference. I never really though my skin was bad, but after seeing the complexion even everywhere -- I can't go back! If you have issues with discoloration, this probably could help a lot.\n",
      "1465->Excellent for removing eye makeup but prefer Eye Scrubs | 4 | 4 | I like the wipes to take off make-up but I find that I dislike the &#34;bumps&#34; somewhat.  The reason I purchased them is that I currently have a little eye infection and want to clean the eye lashes and eye thoroughly (not using makeup actually right now).  I don't like these nearly as well as the Eye Scrubs I bought previously on Amazon.  They seemed the clean the eyes better.<br /><br />I've used these wipes now for a few times and I find I have to wipe a lot to get the eyes really clean.  I also wish they came in a refillable container but they do have a little flap to close the package.  The price is very good for two packages at $14.95 with Prime.<br /><br />So if a person is just looking for an eye makeup remover, this is a very good product.  It's gentle, low priced and does it's job.  I just like the ones I mentioned better even though they are so much more expensive.\n",
      "1467->Surprisingly great | 4 | 4 | Pros:<br />Made my eyelashes look like butterflies. Nice deep black color<br />Definitely waterproof  (cried twice while wearing, no flaking or smudging)<br />Cons:<br />I have no idea why, but it's really wet when you first apply it. I get it on the crease of my eyelid all the time. It has the consistency of runny acrylic paint. It's not just me being clumsy I promise. But the upside to this is that it wipes off amazingly well\n",
      "1473->Volume, but not great for curls or waves. | 3 | 4 | Not for me, or for anyone with waves and curls. The brush is unable to straighten close to your scalp line, which is a problem for those of us with curly or wavy hair.<br />However, I did notice some extra volume from using the brush and I don't think it was as harsh on my hair as a regular straightener is.<br />But because of my own hair type, I don't think it's for me, but would be great for anyone with slight waves or straighter hair.\n",
      "1481->Different..... but nice | 4 | 4 | Definitely softens the beard and calms the itch. Cuts down on \"beardruff\" by moisturizing the face. Its a fairly light oil, not real greasy or 'heavy'. Now for the smell...<br /><br />... The first time you put this on it may seem strong and even a bit overpowering to some, like many new unfamiliar scents. Keeping in mind it goes on the face near the nose, the scent initially comes off stronger than it actually is. My wife loves it, saying its subtle and masculine. After a few applications, I quickly became accustomed to the smell.<br /><br />I'm prefer to be outdoors, and if I had my way, I'd smell like campfire smoke 365 days a year. That being said, I wanted an outdoorsy smell, nothing too sweet, citrus or floral. The Canoeist beard oil smells like birch and cedar. It also has grassy undertones, similar to alfalfa hay, with notes of rosemary and/or sandalwood. Make sense with vetiver being a grass and all.<br /><br />Ingredients as listed on bottle.... grape seed oil, vetiver essential oil, cedarwood essential oil, birch essential oil, and vitamin E oil.<br /><br />I have my own landscaping business, and love the smell of fresh cut grass, which I often smell like anyway. This scent isn't too far off from that fresh cut grass smell. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />SPO\n",
      "1484->Good value | 3 | 4 | This 2-piece Waterproof Mascara is a very good value. The mascara is not a super “wet” formula - its a bit on the dry side which has its pros and cons. Pros: Will not weigh fine/thin lashes down or flatten them like some super wet mascaras will do. It is also buildable. Cons:  If takes multiple applications to add real volume and thickness to your lashes.<br /><br />This mascara did not cause any irritation or sensitivity and it stayed put all day long (even when sweating). It’s also easy to remove with a waterproof eye makeup remover.<br /><br />I didn’t notice this mascara helping curl my lashes. I still had to use an eyelash curler to give my lashes curl.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good mascara. See my pictures for details.\n",
      "1494->OK to darken brows- don't buy to cover grey hairs | 3 | 4 | I bought this product to cover grey eyebrow hairs and it does NOT- thus the three stars.  But if you are buying it simply to darken your normally light eyebrows I think it would work just fine.  It's easy to use.  The capsules are a little fiddly so open it over a paper towel or something in case of a spill.  I bought dark brown and it darkened my already mostly dark brown eyebrows but didn't cover the greys at ALL although I really only deposited the color on that area.<br /><br />1/28/18 update:  I threw it out- total waste of money.  Now I use Anatasia Dipbrow Pomade  every single day.  It take an extra 30 seconds to apply but it quickly covers the grey hairs in my dark brows, stays put no matter what I do, and for $18 @ Sephora (it's a little bit more on Amazon but I still think worth it) it's still a better deal than going all the time to have my brows tinted professionally every few weeks.  You only need to use a tiny, tiny amount so start slow and use a good brush.\n",
      "1498->You will smell like a Stallion in it's prime | 5 | 4 | Ha! I love it! Just got it today and I love the smell. Yeah, it smells like old dude, but I'm on my way. It's a clean, cedar/sandalwood smell. It's cornstarch, not talc (which I think talc may cause medical conditions).<br /><br />Warning: if you put this on, dont get near the retirement home, you'll get MOBBED\n",
      "1507->Stone Crop Serum for Face | 5 | 4 | [[ASIN:B01F7K1CRC Stone Crop Serum for Face - Natural Skin Lightening Reduces Pigmentation & Dark Spots on Skin, Attacks Wrinkles & Fine Lines - Vitamin C, E & B Complex - 1oz]]<br /><br />I was looking for a good serum to help my face look good for my upcoming wedding. I am a little older than my fiance but I didn't want my face to show it on my special day. I take the best care of my skin to try to keep it as youthful as possible, so when I had the opportunity to try this serum, I was happy to do so. The serum comes in a screw top and eye dropper dispenser. The bottle is a dark amber colored glass bottle. There is one fluid ounce in the bottle. The serum has a sort of medicinal scent, not unpleasant and not too strong. It leave behind no real scent once it absorbs in. The serum feels refreshing and absorbs quickly and thoroughly into my skin. I feel an immediate pleasant tightening effect and the skin looks smooth and supple almost immediately. I've been using the stone crop serum for two weeks which is not really enough time to be able to tell the full effect of the serum on fine lines and wrinkles, but I do notice softening in expression lines in my forehead and in fine lines and that my skin stays better hydrated throughout the day. There is no burning, redness or irritation with the use of the serum and no product residue left behind. The manufacturer offers a 100% Money-Back Guarantee which I appreciate but have never had a problem with Eva Naturals products before. I am enjoying the serum and consider it a good value at under 19.00 delivered to my door and by the fact that a little goes a long way with only one dropper full of serum enough to do my entire face.\n",
      "1515->It’s not the same | 1 | 4 | WARNING: The quality of hello bello  is normally good...But this is not the same product!!!<br /><br /> I am down voting this because the quality was poor. This does not smell or feel the same as the main hello bello brand.. I don’t know if it’s expired or soured or if they are just put a different product in the bottle but it is not the same! The bottles also leaked in the package and half of them are empty! Very disappointed ☹️<br /><br />Lesson learned- only order through the main website or Walmart\n",

      "1524->Good Value for Your Money With Pleasing Results | 5 | 4 | I bought this product, the Neutrogena Wave because I wanted to take my skincare regimin to the next level. I looked at the competetors but settled on this product due to the price of $12.97 at Walmart. It comes with the massager, pop-out attachment for the cleansing pad,(14) and a AA battery along with 14 cleansing pads. First, let me say I'm in my fifty's so skincare is important to me but I don't have the luxury of spending hundreds on skincare products. My skin is now starting to show signs of aging by fine lines and deep wrinkles and circles under my eyes. My main goal from this product is for my skin to improve in the following areas:<br /><br />more even skin texture<br />more radiance<br />more firmness<br />more softer, subtle feel<br />help with deep skin cleansing and exfoliation<br /><br />  I used this product today for the first time following the instructions carefully. The product is very well made so far as the size as it comfortably fits in your palm. The attachment which holds the cleanser pad comes of easily and the cleansing pad attachs to it with no problems. Simply wet the pad with some water and push the button to start.You can also re- wet the pad if more is needed later. The vibration is both somewhat quiet but not irritating on the skin at all. You don't need to push on the product while holding it as it does the massaging for you!! The cleansing pads have a nice smell to them- nothing too perfumy, just a nice clean smell. Simply guide the skin massager over your face concentrating on the areas that you feel need the most attention. You control how long you feel each area needs to be cleansed.<br />  I found my skin afterward to be more soft and brighter than before I used the Neutrogena Wave. It was easy to use and control and can ber used in the shower. The cleansing pads are available for about $6.49 for about 1-2 months worth depending on how often you use the product. It is gentle enough I feel you could use it every day depending on yourt skin type.<br />  Bottom line is, if you don't want to spend alot for a \"skin rejuvenator\" than consider the Neutrogena Wave! I think you'll like the results and for alot less too!!\n",
      "1532->Good wig for the price | 4 | 4 | This is a good wig for the price. This is not a $100 wig, but looks good. The bangs are straight and the sides and back curly. The package comes with box, cap and wig. This wig is not for daily use, but great for bedroom or costumes. Is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust to your head. The instructions for washing was on back of box, just make sure to use cool water.<br />This is more of a costume wig for use 2-3 times. It does shed a little with first use and adjustment. Once I got it on my head and brushed it out a little, it looked good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes with head cap<br />Good price<br />Looks good<br />I like the curls<br />Easy to adjust band to fit head<br /><br />Cons:<br />More of a costume wig for uses 2-3 times<br /><br />I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "1534->The product is great but doesn't work for me. | 3 | 4 | I had originally been purchasing Tom Ford Oud Wood cologne at a retail outlet and found that while expensive it is a great-smelling cologne and a cologne that lasts a long time on my skin and clothing. But I decided to try &#34;Perfume Oils&#34; instead of the actual cologne because the &#34;Perfume Oils&#34; are about 10 to 20 times cheaper than the actual cologne. So I ordered 8 oz, Brown - Bargz Perfume - Oud Wood Body oil. The oil arrived as Amazon said it would ... on time .. in perfect condition ... so I tried some of the product.<br /><br />The oil smelled really wonderful in the container and it smelled really wonderful and authentically &#34;Oud Wood&#34; on my skin but it lasted on me for only about an hour and then the odor faded away to almost none at all. I do not blame the oil for this because all fragrances have their[[ASIN:B00XYM54TI 8 oz, Brown - Bargz Perfume - Oud Wood Body Oil For Men by Tom Ford Scented Fragrance]] own characteristics and all fragrances react with individual body chemistry in a different manner. Some fragrances last on individual users longer than others because of the effects of bodily chemistry. So if anything I suspect that my experience with the product is strictly based on my personal body chemistry and so my disappointment has nothing to do with the product. I will not blame the product. But I sense that I will have to return to using actual colognes instead of body oil formulations.\n",
      "1545->Never used anything else again | 5 | 4 | I love these for a few reasons:<br />- They clean out easy and dry fast, so nothing gross can grow in corners like some exfoliating options<br />- Out of the package they are VERY rough and scrubby but without being uncomfortable<br />--- NOTE: you do have to replace them when they go soft if you still want that roughness. Usually about 3-5 months for me though.<br />- Bright colors are easy to find<br />- very light, so travel is easy and they're easy to hang around the shower when you're done\n",

      "1551->Great product. Pretty color purple. Good price. Great for nail art!!! | 5 | 4 | I got this to try as a cheaper alternative for liquid Latex nail protector. It arrived quickly. It IS absolutely a much more cost effective alternative for buying the tiny bottles individually. And this company has lots of color options too.<br /><br />What I did:<br />I received it and immediately painted it around a nail bed to test it's effectiveness. And since, I've compared it's coverage/ease of use/removability to a product that is intended for nail use (a liquid palisade product).<br />Results are:<br />it works EXACTLY the same. No harder or easier to use. So, if someone uses liquid Latex for nail art protection already, this IS absolutely a great alternative!!! Once I knew it would work great, I got out an empty nail polish bottle and used a little mini funnel and poured it in. I also decided to spice it up with glitter, like some of the more popular liquid Latex for nails companies have done...and it works perfectly still, and looks more exciting, and is amazing!<br />Verdict:<br />I will continue to buy this as my nail art protection. The other items (that are intended for nail art) work great for the same thing, but this is a cheaper and much more customizable option... which I like!<br />Keep in mind, you can use any empty polish bottles... just clean them out thoroughly first. The glitter is completely optional...but if you do use it, I recommend ONLY using the cosmetic grade glitters...craft glitters are just too cheap and they bleed and curl and ruin the stuff they get submerged in. And any tiny funnel would help you get it into a different container.<br /><br />I attached photos.<br />The pics include:<br />The actual product. What I used to &#34;make&#34; it easily applicable for nails. What it looks like when immediately applied, once dried (which dries to a darker shade), and how easy it is to remove with no residue!<br /><br />So, I say, this is a great option for nail art enthusiasts like me, and this product would probably also work for other latex uses (like it is shown on the bottle). So, for my liquid latex needs, I'll go to this product from now on.\n",
      "1552->Vibrant color, but very messy. | 4 | 4 | I'm posting a pic of my hair pre-bleach, post bleach, and post pink dye. I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.<br /><br />This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these &#34;Direct dye&#34; bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).<br /><br />My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility / laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.\n",
      "1561->Great travel solution! | 4 | 4 | This portable wig stand was very easy to assemble. I ordered it to hold my halo extensions. I always take them with me when I travel but I don't take the foam head to put them down on because it is way to bulky to pack along. This portable wig stand is a perfect solution. It is taken apart easily packed into any size overnight bag and easily assembled once you get to your destination. You cannot use this a s a stand to style your wigs as you cannot pin it down but this is a great solution for a stand on the go!!<br />I received this portable wig stand free in order to test it and share my honest and unbiased opinion.\n",
      "1571->Really thin bundles, re-thinking this purchase. | 2 | 4 | The color is very pretty and as pictured, but as many have stated the bundle in each pack is extremely THIN. I attached a picture of a pack of Bobbi Boss braiding hair that I picked up locally to compare the bundle size. I'm considering returning for a refund for this reason. Ohhh and there is no brand name listed on the pack of hair, no directions, and no description of what kind of hair this is. It's just a plain bag, it doesn't even have directions on if hair can be boiled to &#34;lock&#34; the braid so it will not unravel. The hair also has a strange unpleasant smell. I'll definitely do a vinegar rinse if I keep the hair.<br /><br />***update***<br />I rinsed the hair in apple cider vinegar to get rid of the funny smell. It helped a little bit and the hair kept its color. My daughter's hair came out very pretty! I attached a photo. She's 11 years old and has a small head. It took 10 packs of this hair!!! Ohh and fyi the light blue part tangles very easy and feels like cheap doll hair. The black section and royal blue section was fine. Everyone loved her hair and she had compliments everywhere we went!\n",
      "1572->10 out of 10 do NOT recommend | 2 | 4 | I had a lot of hope for this curling iron because I love curling my hair but I'm not the best at it, so this looked like a great option. Unfortunately, it fell far short of my hopes and dreams.<br /><br />The hair clips into a little clip at the bottom of the barrel. At first I thought it was genius, then I used it. I lost so much hair from that clip - my hair kept hooking onto it and pulling the hair out. And honestly, it didn't curl very well (my hair is just past my shoulders). I had to bring out my regular curling iron in order to fix the mess-up that occurred because of this curling iron.<br /><br />I will say that the fact that it turns automatically would be nice for someone with a disability or a difficult time moving, but for the average person? 10 out of 10 do not recommend.\n",
      "1579->Did not work well for me, polish did not cure and peeled off | 2 | 4 | Arrived earlier than expected, but unfortunately did not work well for me.<br /><br />I don’t know if it was the polish or the lamp, but the polish would not cure. Even after five 90 second cycles under the lamp, both the base coat and polish felt tacky, and did not harden. Only the top coats sort of cured, but the polish underneath never did, so it didn’t harden and all just peeled off after a couple days. It didn’t even need to soak off.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller and they were responsive and helpful, but unfortunately their tips and instructions did not help to get a better result.<br /><br />I would give one star for the polish and lamp, but added a star because the nail files and other tools were good quality.\n",
      "1608->Unpleasant smell | 2 | 4 | I purchased this gel to use with my solawave device. The cost per ounce was very reasonable. I opened it and I was put off by the unpleasant smell. I don’t know if I got a spoiled batch or that’s the way it smells. Conductive gel is a must if you are using any kind of a facial device.<br />The Nuface gel works well and doesn’t have an unpleasant smell.\n",

I will update in another week.<br />What I like so far :<br />----it's mattifying<br />-----the scent is amazing<br />I love their glutathione soap, it has faded my acne spots so much I can go with a tinted moisturizer now instead of a million layers of foundation.<br />Update: I used this for almost 2 months, the first month with the glutathione soap, my acne spots lightened . In the 2nd month I did not use the soap and noticed no lightening.<br />I now just use the soap and my face is completely clear except for my one period pimple every month.\n",

      "1623->Great Loki wig | 5 | 4 | I brought this for my Loki costume and I say this is the perfect front lace wig brand/series I had ever encountered. I had ordered a more expensive front lace wig, and the hairline of that wig was horrible. It was a nightmare to create the hairline needed to complete another costume. The Ebingoo wig is nothing like that one. Ebingoo came with a perfect hairline. I just cut along the edge of the lace to remove the excess. It had a similar hairline that I have but more hair at the receding parts. I am very happy and will be ordering more of this wig brand/series in the future.<br /><br />To complete my wigs' look I just used a curling hair drier brush to curl the ends to appear more like Loki from the movies.\n",
      "1625->True Dermacol - Product Brokedown | 3 | 4 | I want to start by saying this is &#34;Authentic&#34; Dermacol. I verified the product code & packaging. My issues are not with the seller. Product was as described & shipped<br />quickly. I have used this product 3 x since receiving. Basically this is traditional pan make up in a tube. It's very thick & quite greasy on its own. I have tried to make good use of Dermacol, unfortunately no matter how I prep/prime/set/apply this make up broke down within in 3 hrs. My skin is normal with an occasional  break out. I have not experienced any break outs. I feel this product is truly for stage/photo use. The amount needed for &#34;full&#34; coverage would be akin to literally wearing a mask. The product did not blend & basically sat on top of the skin. As it breaks down it becomes a thin, speckled look. Primer, setting powder nor spray made a difference. Then it settles in ALL your fine lines & imperfections. It's a hard pass for me. I would like to also add, the promos with product covering tatoos etc is just hype. It May be water proof but be advised it's not smudge/rub proof.\n",
      "1642->Don't buy! Save your time and money. | 1 | 4 | This is JUNK. Don't buy.<br />The light is so dim that I've seen brighter illumination from three fireflies!<br />Once again, this proves that no one tests these products before posting.<br />You've been warned.<br />I'm returning this product ASAP.\n",
      "1644->Convenient but I couldn't reuse them. | 3 | 4 | What you get - 4 pairs of ready to wear lashes with adhesive strips already on them (Can be cut to size).<br /><br />Pros - no magnetic liner or glue to worry about. These do give a pretty decent effect although takes a little practice to get them on.<br /><br />Cons - I didn't feel they stayed on as well as magnetic lashes do. I wore them for an hour show and they barely stayed. When I removed them there was no way that I would be able to use them again. They just weren't sticky enough.<br /><br />Overall - might be OK for teens, or people that don't do well with magnetic liner oe eyelash glue but for me they weren't secure enough. For the price though it could be worth a try if you don't normally wear lashes and want them for a special event.\n",
      "1645->Not working for me. | 2 | 4 | Love the color & the &#34;teeth&#34;, BUT there are a few &#34;features&#34; I didn't expect that will probably result in my never being able to use this.<br /><br />1. Even though I'm a very small person w/ a head to match, this headband gave me an IMMEDIATE headache because it's both too tight and too straight-sided (beginning @ the point where the &#34;teeth&#34; stop).<br /><br />2. The headband is misshapen in that one side of the band is half an inch longer than the other, so that the &#34;teeth&#34; go further down on the left side than the right. This results in one side of the band presseing painfully into the bone behind my left ear (rather than resting by the soft, cartilage area behind the ear, where normal length head bands don't create any discomfort).<br /><br />3. Even the shorter side of the headband is too long for me, but the longer side is so long that it just sticks out into space. Since I wear my hair up this is decidedly unattractive, not to mention uncomfortable.<br /><br />4. I was really hoping there would be more teeth. Three or four more per side would be ideal.<br /><br />5. Instead of straight sides the band would be MUCH more comfortable if it were rounded at every point.<br /><br />Obviously people have different head shapes & sizes, but I can only describe what is comfortable & works for me.\n",
      "1650->So-so results. | 3 | 4 | I'm a white girl with hair that goes wild when left to its own devices. It will tame itself and lay in beautiful curls with the right product combo. Unfortunately, I can no longer find all the ingredients in the recipe in stores, so I thought I'd give this a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the smell. I feel like I just left the hair dresser after getting my hair dyed. It has the strong post-dye odor. I thought it may decrease as my hair dried, but it's still as strong as when it was first applied.<br /><br />It works about half. By that I mean my hair is somewhere between the untamed frizzy mess of no curl product and the little-frizz, smooth curls I know can be obtained with the right products. It's at least in a state I could leave the house in.<br /><br />I used about a tbsp size throughout my hair. Had I used more (because my hair goes to my mid back) it may have tamed it more. Unfortunately,  I feel this product is too expensive to use gobs of it every time I wash my hair.<br /><br />Between the odor and the so-so results, I can't say I'll be buying anymore.\n",
      "1652->These are great stamping plates! | 5 | 4 | These are great stamping plates. I've owned many plates made by different manufacturers good and bad. These are as good as anything that I have. I've  tried stamping a few of the images and they all are very clear and crisp. I did these quickly on paper. The plates seem to be engraved well. It comes with two different kinds of stampers plus two scrapers. Both of the stampers work excellent.  I would definitely buy these again and others made by Bluezoo.  In fact I will be looking on Amazon for more plates made by them.  If you are new to nail stamping one thing to know is that you must take the protective covering off of each plate, it peels right off.  It takes some practice but once you have the hang of it you will love nail stamping.  I would definitely recommend this set, it would be a good starter set because  it comes with scrapers and stampers.  I would also recommend using thicker nail polish her polish made specially for nail stamping. It seems to be easier to use than trying to use common nail polish which tends to be a little thin and often smears.  I am happy with this product and would highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was offered this product either free or at a reduced cost in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. The opinions expressed are my own. I have no connection with the seller other than being an Amazon buyer.  I hope find this review beneficial to you. Happy shopping!\n",
      "1656->GReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On | 5 | 4 | As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.\n",
      "1662->ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?!!! | 1 | 4 | THIS PRODUCT HASN'T BEEN MADE FOR YEEEEARS !!!  YOU'D HAVE TO BE JOHN FRIEDA TO AFFORD THIS COMPANYS PRICE !  AND ONLY \"ONE LEFT?\":...YOU ONLY HAD ONE TO BEGIN WITH !<br /><br />ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND WHY THEY STOPPED MAKING IT IS BEYOND ME....\n",
      "1663->NOT DOUBLE WALLED BUT......... | 2 | 4 | The negative is the description states that these jars are double walled. THEY ARE NOT. If your lotion or cream or balm is sensitive to heat, look elsewhere on amazon, as other places offer double wall containers that hold the same amount as these thin walled containers. The jars are fine for what they are,  and they will be OK for something else perhaps, but not for what I ordered them for because I needed what they advertised....DOUBLE WALL CONTAINERS!!! Also they can be a little tricky to open. Try holding the bottom part loosely as you turn the lid. To much pressure on the jar contorts the circumference of the jar and prevents the lid from unscrewing.<br />The positive part is the price is very good, shipping via prime is excellent, the inserts included area a nice inclusion and the jars are very white and opaque.\n",

      "1681->Liar. Liar. | 1 | 4 | One star, minus one star = Zero stars!<br />I don't know how anyone could give this product any stars.<br />It clumped my eyelashes together, and I looked ridiculous.<br />  Good thing I looked in my magnifying mirror  before leaving the house because I I had<br />a dozen or more little flakes of mascara all over my face.<br />Had to take a Q-tip and slowly remove each one.<br />Unfortunately, I was now pressed for time, and couldn't totally remove this mascara from my eyelashes.<br />I've purchased many lousy mascaras in my lifetime, and this is the worst.<br />Had high hopes for this product.\n",
      "1685->Do not work...don't buy!! | 1 | 4 | I bought these with high hopes of not having to dig my fingers to the back of my mouth to remove my aligners. Those were false hopes unfortunately. These things do not latch onto the aligners at all, and when they do they don't hold tight enough to remove anything. I ended up using my fingers anyway.<br /><br />And of course, by the time you figure out they don't work you've had them in your mouth and cannot return...so for your own benefit I say..DO NOT BUY. Just use your fingers....these things are just a pointless gimmick (and way too expensive for the tiny pieces of plastic they are anyway).\n",
      "1689->Nice solution to using all of the bar of soap | 4 | 4 | I've been using liquid body wash years but started thinking about the plastic waste from the bottles and went looking for a solution that would allow me to use bar soap but not end up with the slivers left over. This seems like a reasonable compromise. The mesh bags hold the soap and allow you to use all of it, down to the very last tiny piece. They foam up nice and the mesh bag provides a bit of scrubbing like I'd get from a standard shower puff. It's a bit tricky to use when switching from hand to hand as you have to try and keep the drawstring closed so the soap doesn't fall out but the drawstring is what allows you to hang the bag after your shower, which keeps it from getting sticky and covered in slime. That's the reason I went with mesh instead of a natural, woven material as a lot of the comments were that the bags disintegrated quickly and got sticky and gummy because they couldn't dry properly between uses.<br /><br />These seem sturdy enough like they'll last through several bars of soap. And the pack of 20 means I'll have enough for me (a single person) to last for awhile.<br /><br />The reason I deducted a star is the excessive packaging. The irony for me is that I got these to get away from buying plastic bottles (that can be recycled). These came individually wrapped, wrapped together in another bag, inside a bigger bag - none of which can be recycled. Seems a bit excessive for mesh bags.\n",

      "1700->Quality fabric....fastner needs HELP!! | 3 | 4 | I Love these Towels.  My daughter swears by them (not this particular brand), so when I saw an advertisement I ordered them&#62;  I have only had them for less than 2 weeks and only used the one so far and the elastic that goes around the button to hold it in place already broke....so frustrated, I now fight and fight with the towel,  coming up with all crazy ways to get it to stay on my head.  Makes for an unpleasant experience when getting ready for work everyday!!!  Otherwise I love the towel...its thicker than expected which is really nice.  It soaks up a lot of the moisture from the wet hair.<br />IF THE FASTNER DIDNT' BREAK SO QUICKLY I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A 5 STAR FOR SURE!!\n",
      "1712->Not good | 1 | 4 | My unit must of been defective, it boils the  acetone it leaks and it has melted my on off button to where I can't even use it anymore.<br /> I have not contacted the seller. But after writing this review I think it's the best thing so that they will be aware of what happened to the unit and hopefully I will get a replacement. I did attach a photo to show the button and it even melted the temperature indicators plastic right off.\n",
      "1713->Bronze pleather is more suited for a purse, but quality seems fine | 3 | 4 | I bought 2 to give as part of a groomsman gift.  I'm putting together a shaving kit for them, and thought this would be good.<br /><br />It is....OK.....I didn't read the description in its entirety...I saw the title &#34;Leather&#34; and saw &#34;leather&#34; in the description a few times, so I bought it, but now that I go back and re-read it, it does say &#34;PU Leather&#34; at the bottom of the description.  Polyurethane....aka pleather aka fake leather.  My fault for not being entirely completely diligent in reading.  Color is also...ok...possibly less than ok.  Honestly, the shimmery bronze tint is better suited for a woman's handbag than a manly man's man bag.<br /><br />In terms of storage, it does what I intended it to do.  But I am disappointed in it.  But since the double edge razor and set I am giving them is the important part, hopefully they will look beyond the bronze pleather bag.\n",
      "1733->Color is misrepresented in the photo | 3 | 4 | Pros:<br />Very fine texture<br />Well packaged<br />Easy to mix<br /><br />Cons:<br />Extremely bland color - a very light reddish color with about 1/4 the color saturation value as shown in the picture.<br /><br />Using this as I have other Moroccan red clay, the color is almost imperceptible unless it is contrasted with a different color.  Think of it like a a sun-bleached adobe color.  I can and will use the remainder of it, but not when color is important.\n",
      "1735->Both dispersers BUSTED, but it's the lotion that counts | 3 | 4 | This is the 2nd set of TJoe's lotion I've ordered at Amazon. Sometimes I pick these up at Trader Joes, but it's just way more convenient to shop online these days. I had no issues at all with the first pair of lotions, but just a heads-up here: the 2nd set arrived oozing lotion. Turns out both dispenser pumps were BUSTED. Augh! Luckily, I still had the pumps from both of my old bottles, so I just transferred them into the new ones. But .... NO idea how the plastic pumps literally broke! They don't even touch each other when shrink wrapped together! Maybe it was the change in pressure as I live a mile high?<br /><br />I DO love the consistency and longevity of the lotion, so that's what counts here. Great value for the money ... but if you have a pump on-hand already, DO NOT throw it away till you ensure the new ones aren't BUSTED.\n",
      "1743->NOT WOOD. Looks cheap, Was Damaged, Bad Returns Policy (you pay to ship and weigh the package) | 1 | 4 | I posted this review to a previous listing, so the seller started a new listing in an attempt to hide my review from you! So I have reposted my review here:<br />This item looks cheap in person. It isn't wood; it looks more like chipboard. Doesn't appear to be cherry, more like it has a cherry coloring applied to the chipboard. The photos make it look a lot nicer than it is. The finish looks cheap and the hardware is very yellow in color. It was also chipped on the front.<br />When we went to return it, we received a return label with \"postage required\" on it from the seller, YourBestBargains. I would have had to stand in a line at the post office and buy the postage in order to return it. The box is huge.<br />We then asked for a return stating that it didn't match the description. YourBestBargins refused the return saying we were out of the 30 day return window and that \"wood\" was part of the manufacture's description. Amazon messaged the seller on our behalf and stated that we were indeed within the return window; the seller still refused the return. There was a brochure within the box from the manufacturer, the manufacturer called this item \"Luxury Deluxe Cosmetic Box\" and didn't mention \"wood\" in the title or description.\n",
      "1755->Good for carry on | 5 | 4 | Purchased these to travel international without checking in luggage.  Different countries have varying standards on liquids in carry on luggage and no matter what country, these containers will meet those standards.  If you use these for an over night stay somewhere, or have an unexpected stay at an airport hotel, they should be able to hold enough supplies for that, but not for more than maybe 2 days.<br /><br />They are sturdy plastic, opaque containers and are flexible enough to squeeze the contents out. The caps are push in type and is better than the lift up caps where the cover can easily break off.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when you buy other travel container sets, I find that a few of the containers are useless, like the spray bottle and the little &#34;pill&#34; container with the screw off lid, at least for my needs.  This particular set has all of the type of containers that I needed, and more than enough for all the products that I carry.\n",
      "1756->COMPLETELY USELESS FOR GEL POLISHES!!! | 1 | 4 | Umm, what on earth is the point of these?  When you read about these, it's likely your first thought is that these would be great for soaking off shellac nail polishes (aka UV gel polish), right?  WELL, there's just one not so tiny problem with that.  Nail polish remover unless it has acetone in it cannot remove gel or shellac polish.  I think I hear a &#34;no duh&#34; coming from you...lol.  But these little do-dads are not able to hold pure acetone!  The second I filled one of these with acetone the pink plastic became very hard and extremely brittle and acetone leaked all over.<br /><br />So again I ask, What's the point here?!?\n",
      "1762->Sheer, MATTE and pale color unless you put on 5+ coats | 1 | 4 | Not sure what this formula is supposed to be.  It goes on very sheer, has a light purple color, certainly NOT neon. It dries very quickly but is MATTE.  The color in the bottle is accurate but only when you put on 5 coats and then use a topcoat to get a shine.  You can see the difference in the sheen: one is without a topcoat (and is matte) the second pix is with the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri in 'Clearly Quick'.<br />This is horrible.  Not the usual Sally Hansen quality at all.  This was a loss.\n",
      "1773->Not for long, thick, and wavy hair | 1 | 4 | These things are lousy for long and thick hair. Not comfortable and made my hair look odd due to the coiled nature. As for dents, I didn’t notice a difference. Removing it was a pain and pulled out hair. My hair is very long (waist length), thick, and wavy... obviously this isn’t a product for my type of hair.<br /><br />By the way, I was originally sent a small dog play ball! Took me a bit to find out why I received it (error by the vendor, Beauty Collection). So if you get some weird item... check your orders ;)\n",
      "1781->Soft Skin and Hair | 5 | 4 | DISCLOSURE: I received a sample of this item at no cost in order to test, with the option to review if I so desired.<br /><br />As one that makes a lot of my own skin care preparations, argan oil is a key ingredient in many of them.<br />Mixed with rosehip seed oil and a little emu oil, it makes an excellent lotion for chapped and cracked hands and feet.<br />Adding some avocado oil makes it amazing as a pre-wash hair conditioner.<br />Apply to the hair while it is dry (and scalp if you have a dry scalp), then after anywhere from a minute to an hour, shampoo it out for soft, silky hair.\n",
      "1782->First-time user, monitoring my progress and reporting... | 3 | 4 | I have only used this twice so far, but I will update as I use it more**<br /><br />First off, I was really excited to get this in the mail. I even took &#34;Before&#34; pictures because I wanted to watch the progression to mega white teeth. Also, I love trying any remedy that is weird and natural, garlic for a cold, or vinegar for my mirrors, etc. so I was p\\ump\\ed o finally find a fluoride-free and bleach-free whitener.<br /><br />In a nutshell, while this is fun to use (isn't messy if you follow directions), I really haven't seen any whitening results. YET. I used it twice, with 3 days rest in between. Maybe a touch, but nothing notable... like 10-12% whiter. My teeth FEEL great, probably because this is essentially a super fine powder polish, but the whitening really hasn't shown up yet. I have only used it for the recommended brush-time. Make sure to floss after. I will post updates as I use it more.\n",
      "1789->Witchcraft? | 1 | 4 | I'm a dude and I love this thing. It arrived last night and after an over night charge is was ready to go. I had a super painful callus on the ball of foot. It bothered me for months. It's now gone and my feet are incredibly soft. This thing is some sort of witchcraft<br /><br />Update<br />Device stopped working after just a few weeks.  Won't turn on with full charge. I was worried about this after reading other reviews.\n",
      "1793->Great job.  Feels solid and sturdy.  Not too noisy. | 5 | 4 | Long ago I went with Sonicare at my dentist's suggestion.  Got this Oral B and have to say it is giving my Sonicare a run for the money.  I like the feel of it.  I like the red light that flashes when you are applying too much pressure.<br /><br />The 30 second alert is similar in both units.<br /><br />The one thing I really like is that this brush keeps on going once you reach the two minute mark.  The Sonicare stops.  So if I want to spend a few more seconds on a couple of back teeth just to make sure I don't have to turn this on again.  I just continue.  I like that.<br /><br />They probably do a similar job in cleaning.  Over the years I have benefitted from using this type of brush.  One plus is that you need to do the 2 minute cleaning.  Of course you can do a quick one or a more thorough one, but the normal default cleaning is two minutes.  It works and it feels good to handle.<br /><br />You can't go wrong and your teeth will thank you.\n",
      "1796->An excellent glove brush | 5 | 4 | This product makes brushing my Goldendoodle so much easier.<br /><br />It arrived very quickly and is exactly as described.<br /><br />It is made to fit on the right hand and has a Velcro type wrist cuff that can be tightened so it doesn't slip around. The plastic tipped bristles cover the entire palm and thumb area making it so you brush large areas with every stroke.<br /><br />It is made from a breathable fabric which makes it comfortable and cool to wear.<br /><br />Hair pulls out of the bristles easily when finished brushing so it can be left clean for the next grooming.<br /><br />It is well made and should last a long time.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "1798->some soaps its fine, others are not | 4 | 4 | so apparently I'm one of those people that has difficulty lathering it up correctly. I do have hard water but with a softener...some soaps its fine, others are not. i definitely have to work for this one! I've only been using it for a few days now, with an EJ DB89 and Polisilver Super iridium blades, and its a nice shave. I'll have to try it with some other blades too...I occasionally swap between Astra and Feathers as well.<br />Using this setup the razor does glide nicely. I'm mixed on the scent however... its soapy, which I don't mind, but tends to linger longer than I like. I do prefer it to other scents like bay rum and sandalwood... they are too 'old man'-ish for my tastes, even though they are a favorite with others. If you're used to those and not a soapy/clean scent, this might not be to your liking. Lastly, I have a feeling this puck is going to last a VERY long time! I'll give it a few more weeks before deciding if it'll have a permanent place in my rotation but so far I think its a yes.\n",
      "1803->Good quality, great for shorter hair | 5 | 4 | This sleep cap is really nicely made.  The color is well named, as the item I received is a deep jewel tone, like in a peacock's feather.  It's a much nicer color than on my monitor (the pictured item looks to me like &#34;royal&#34; blue).<br /><br />The ties in the back allow you to adjust the fit; I haven't had them come untied.  It's comfortable and nice not to have elastic digging into my forehead.  There's not as much hair-space as in other caps I've used.  This one is more for thin hair or a shorter hairstyle.<br /><br />My short curls tend to flatten if I sleep mostly on one side, but if you aren't sleeping in rollers (or with your head magically levitated) that can't be helped.  A light spritz of water in the morning takes care of the curls.<br /><br />I expect this silk sleep cap to last a long while.\n",

      "1814->Not a good product. Look for something else, even if you have to pay more. | 2 | 4 | I was hoping for a masculine tool kit when I ordered this item. Unfortunately, I did not notice the cutesy little smiley faces carved into the backs of the clippers. The case is okay -- not luxurious (feels cheap) but looks alright, though the latch doesn't hold it closed really at all. It serves as more of an alarm, really. You hear a little &#34;pop&#34; and it comes flying open, so at least you know it's about to spill everywhere for a tenth of a second before it does.<br /><br />But the worst thing about it is the tools themselves, which feel like they're made from maybe a rigid plastic or some of that &#34;compressed powder&#34; material rather than metal. All of them flex and bend out of shape even with the simplest tasks.<br /><br />I would not buy this again, nor would I gift it to an enemy.\n",
      "1820->Daughter likes it, yet only displays in Celsius | 4 | 4 | My daughter says that she uses this on the highest setting which is 230 degrees Celsius . We are a Fahrenheit Family so I told her that that is 446 degrees Fahrenheit (our language and understanding). As far as my understanding, there is no way to adjust to Fahrenheit on the display.<br /><br />She  had long semi thick hair that tangles. She thinks that it is a time saver for everyday use. As it heats up in a minute of so and because it detangles and straightens at the same time. She sometimes follows it up with a hot iron when she is looking for that extra flat and straight look.<br /><br />I like how there is an auto-shut off, yet I tell her to turn off after every use just to play it safe.\n",
      "1821->Not as I expected. | 2 | 4 | This is awful lip gloss.  The colors are gaudy.  The lightest one is opaque and very mat and wears off unevenly.  I also would hesitate to call it lip gloss if it is opaque.  I also felt my lips were very very dry with it on.  I tried two of the colors and didn't like either of them - this stuff is going in the trash.  I got this during a promotion, so I only paid $3.99 for it, but it's not worth even that -- much less the nearly $20 price tag.<br /><br />Update:  The seller contacted me and offered to return my money  I didn't pay much for this, as it was a promotion, but it does show<br />that this seller has awesome customer service.  And, I'm sure they have some other nicer products.\n",
      "1828-># Single For Men, Eau De Toilette 3.3 Fl. Oz. | 5 | 4 | [[ASIN:B01ETWZRL6 # Single For Men, Eau De Toilette 3.3 Fl. Oz./ 100 ml - Inspired By The One Cologne]]<br /><br />I was looking for new scents or signature scents for my future husband and wanted to try this. I like and appreciate the scent of The One Colognes so this was one I wanted my fiance (Bobby) try this scent. Buying signature scents can become quite expensive to say the least and this is a way for us to get an idea of what a scent smells like with Bobby's chemistry without spending thirty five or forty dollars and then not like it. Besides if this cologne scent stays on and lasts a while we may opt to purchase the less expensive cologne. The seller delivered very quickly and we received packaged well. Since this cologne is an Eau De Toilette Spray, it will have slightly more of the oils (10%) that make the spray smell great than just cologne which has about 7% oil. The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of woodsy, citrus masculine scent and you can definitely smell oranges and ginger in it. The One Cologne describes the scent as &#34;Coriander, Grapefruit, Cardamom seed, Tobacco, Basil, Cedar, Ambre, Ginger, Orange Blossom.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells really yummy on Bobby. It takes a little more spray than the original version The One Cologne, however, it's about 1/3 the cost, so I won't complain. It's still pretty strong with a couple of sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a long time. It's sensual/manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne. It is also a large bottle at 3.3 ounces delivered to the door for under 15.00. We like the cologne and can recommend it.\n",
      "1841->Perfect for avoiding messy manicures! | 5 | 4 | I do a lot of nail art that includes stamping, sponging and a bunch of other really messy designs. My problem is that when I do all of those things the polish gets all over my skin making clean up take a bit longer than I like. So I needed to find something that could help with that problem. In comes this liquid latex!<br /><br />I ordered one in the hopes that it would help with keeping the skin around my nails clean while I'm doing those messy manicures. I cleaned out an empty nail polish bottle and filled it up with this liquid latex. Then I used the brush from the nail polish bottle to apply the liquid latex to the skin around my nails. I gave it a few minutes to dry then did my manicure. Once done with the manicure I used a little nail polish remover on a brush to make sure none of the latex was attached to the polish on my nail (don't want to ruin the manicure by pulling the polish on my nail off with the latex). Then, using tweezers, I pulled the latex off of each finger. For the most part it came off easily leaving clean up much easier with less to clean.<br /><br />This was a lifesaver! I am very pleased with this liquid latex. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, it's almost a fishy smell. It is very strong at first when applying. Once dried the smell does dissipate for the most part so it doesn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

      "1845->Rip Off | 3 | 4 | The product is good and smells good. It’s more like a lotion than a butter though.<br />On the other hand, I paid $11.49 for it. When it just arrived, it had a tag of $3.99. I understand making a profit but ripping off people is just another level and not right!!\n",
      "1847->Works for some mini polishes, too | 4 | 4 | I received this product discounted in exchange for a review--I state this disclaimer upfront because that's what I would want to know first, and I too am disturbed by the ratings inflation on Amazon for IEF reviews lately. I do not indiscriminately give 5star reviews, and they are only given for a fraction of products I try that I find are exceptional and I would buy myself at FULL price.  If you wish not to view IEF reviews such as this, click on the filter link to the right of the review section, and then click on &#34;verified purchases only&#34;; that will take most of them out.<br /><br />Well, I'm overall pretty pleased with this product.  I got it hoping I could use it to organize some of my nail polish minis, and it does hold much of my collection.  The mini OPI bottles for the most part fit in the lipstick columns, though not all the way in, for some (strangely enough, the Nordic Collection ones are just a smidge smaller and go in smoothly, despite supposedly being the same exact size).  That was the main purpose of me getting this, so I'm pleased.  I know it was made for other types of makeup, but I already have a system for them; it was all my loose polishes that were driving me nuts.  Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible.  As you can see, I had to put some big bottles upside-down to fit more in.  It still had room for my nail brushes, file, foils, tapes, glitters, and cotton balls in the bottom.  The material is a very clear acrylic, but it doesn't feel too cheap.  One complaint I have is the drawers can get a little stuck; but this is common with these acrylic drawers.  Also, the top pc is separate from the bottom drawers, which I don't like.  But these are all minor complaints.  Overall, pleased it does the job.\n",

My daughter wears make up alot I don't so much so deciding on the right one was difficult for me but she had been asking for this so I got it for her and I am so glad I did. She looks lovely and uses it all the time. It is great it doesn't irritate her skin or bother her at all which was something I was concerned about since she has sensitive skin. It goes on lovely and the colors are very nice not to bright but you can see them easily.

The first order I received was expired, so I did not even bother to take the cellophane off to try it and look at the product.<br /><br />Reached out to Amazon, and they were amazon (as always) and got a replacement out to me that I think actually came faster than the original order.<br /><br />I eagerly tried it.  I mean all those videos showed the same thing, they spread the green stuff on a persons face had to be real, right?????<br /><br />Wrong!!! They show someone with a face full of blackheads getting this product smeared all over their face then  when it is gently wiped it off and the cloth is turned over to reveal the results it shows hundreds of black heads that were miraculously wiped off.<br /><br />Well, there were no instructions in English so I winged it.  I spread it over my face expectantly knowing my face would look amazing as soon as I wiped it off again.  It smelled nice, I will say that.  I let it dry as it seemed to be a clay mask and then wet a cloth to remove it.<br /><br />Would you believe not a single black head appeared on my cloth?  Not ONE!<br /><br />But here is the best part, in a couple days, not only did I still have the few black heads that were still smugly laughing at me from their cozy nests in my pores, but all of their friends and relations showed up for a party on my face.  I have not had a break out like this in years.<br /><br />Just like the good old days, only there are no lockers that I have to worry about being shoved into by the popular kids.\n",
      "1864->allergic reaction | 2 | 4 | i got this product on time.<br />i got an allergic reaction ( lids swolenes and itching) on 4th time of use.<br />have to keep this product  for no reason.<br />i'm not a persaon with tendency to allergy at all. badly surprized :((.\n",
      "1871->Be ware!! | 3 | 4 | The color is not so pink but has more red than you think. A little goes a long way.<br />One caveat-my order sat on a hot delivery truck all day before it was delivered to my home. When I opened the product, I found it melted! Be ware-if you get this, don't open it and immediately put it in the refrigerator for a few hours for it to cool down. When I tried to swipe the heated product, I got about 1/3 of the entire tube in my hand!\n",
      "1897->Good little trimmer with a couple drawbacks | 4 | 4 | First of all, to get the vac to work correctly you have to trim very slowly. The vac is powerful, but it's not THAT powerful. If you trim like a speed demon, you'll have hair clippings all over your counter.<br /><br />Aside from that, this is a great little trimmer. It's not that loud, the blades cut very well, the locking comb settings stay in place, and the charge lasts forever. I trimmed for 3 weeks on a single charge, and I trim about once every 3 days. It would have been nice if there was a carrying case included, but it's not a deal breaker.<br /><br />At Amazon's current price, this is a great deal for a good trimmer.\n",
      "1906->Letdown | 3 | 4 | I liked the shape and the lack of scent.<br />But I am very disappointed as the soap though barely used is splitting in two. I just don’t think it’s well made. Already a bit mushy and I only opened the box last week. I won’t buy these again.\n",
      "1907->Pretty Good - But not Great | 4 | 4 | This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So, yes, I like the product. Here's my rundown:<br /><br />Pluses:<br /><br />  - Good shave<br /><br />  - Less razor burn<br /><br />  - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model)<br /><br />  - easy to clean<br /><br />Minuses:<br /><br />  - Hard to get that \"patch\" under your nose<br /><br />  - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight<br /><br />  - battery/power seem to wane at times<br /><br />  - packets are expensive<br /><br />I'm a cheap SOB, so here's my way of stretching out the life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns.<br /><br />All-in-all doner likes.\n",
      "1923->Actually works | 4 | 4 | I didn't expect much from this, but I was surprised.  The color was beautiful and it is the same viscosity as typical polish.  Iwear polish on my toes year round and as a result was starting to get white spots on my nails.  After trying some over-the-counter treatments unsuccessfully, I saw a review for this product and thought it was worth a shot.  Surprisingly, several weeks later, the spots are completely gone from all but one nail!<br /><br />This polish does seem to chip a bit faster than my typical nail polish, and it is far more expensive than what I normally spend so I'd rate it only 4/5 stars.  But if you are dealing with nail fungus but still want to have painted nails, it's worth a shot!\n",
      "1924->Don't waste your money or health! | 1 | 4 | This was not an expensive item and I probably should have known it would be below par, but I ordered it anyway. It took weeks to be delivered, again, I should have looked to see where the seller was located....China!<br />It arrived, I opened it and it was &#34;thick & clumpy&#34;. I read the box, it said to shake contents before using, so I did for a few minutes and then applied it.<br />It was like applying paste, which is apparently what &#34;waterproof&#34; means to the seller. It felt sticky. When I put food in my mouth, the food stuck to it. When I closed my mouth, my lips stuck together! I couldn't remove it without 3 applications of baby oil. I threw it away before it made me break out in hives or worse.<br />My advice, go to a reputable store in your area to buy anything you apply to your face, before purchasing this. Inexpensive does not always mean a great deal on a great product.\n",
      "1930->Protective coating for nails | 4 | 4 | After using this for a few weeks, my nails are peeling less.  I don't think this actually makes my nails stronger, rather, it acts as a protective coating.  Removal and re-application every three days is a must.<br />Also, this product has a very nice shine.\n",
      "1942->The price was good, but I think if I paid for something ... | 3 | 4 | I will give each item I believe is important in hair a star. Weft, price, color, condition, and style.<br /><br />1- PRICE 1☆. I would give it a half star, but that's not an option, so I went with 1. The price was good, but I think if I paid for something a little more expensive, I would not have had the two below issues.<br /><br />2-COLOR 1☆. The color was really nice, even, and very pretty, ll.<br /><br />3-CONDITION 1☆. The hair had no split ends, wasnt dried out, and was in really nice shape.<br /><br />4-WEFT 0☆. Again I would give it a half, but with no option, it gets no star. The weft was way too think. My stylist had to spend time cutting it down. Time that cost me time and money.<br /><br />5-STYLE. 0☆. I would give this less than 0 if I could. I bought the wavy style, because I dont like straight hair, as my natural is curly. Well, after one was, every single wave is gone. We all know that it is suggested we dont use any type of curling irons, of flat irons to the hair, because it could damage the hair. So, my choice is damage the hair, or wear it straight. I choose the latter, and just put curlers in when I have the time.<br /><br />So, that's my opinion in a nut shell. Hope it helps...\n",
      "1950->Terrific results from a very unique design | 5 | 4 | I have been a huge fan of the relatively inexpensive, paperish, hugely saturated facial masks by companies like My Beauty Diary and others ( you can find my many positive reviews) until stumbling upon these lacey, saturated, fantastic masks.<br /><br />I really can't contribute more than other outstanding reviewers have elaborated on the technical advantages of these lacey versions compared to the paper ones except to say how wonderful it is to position the mask over your face and neck and then be able to gently secure it by pulling it over your ears. Genious. The paper masks were good except the chin area never stays in place and I'm always checking to make sure the rest of it hasn't slid around on my face.<br /><br />These cost a little more but the results were so great after my first one, I immediately purchased 3 more boxes of this version and another one to try out.<br /><br />I am way past 50, but my skin looks terrific. Smooth, soft, healthy and glowing. I could not be happier. Go ahead and give these a try. But you better hurry before I buy them all up.\n",
      "1951->GOOD BUT NOT ALWAYS GREAT | 4 | 4 | I loved this shampoo and conditioner for the first several weeks that I purchased it again.<br />However, after continued use it seemed to have a build up on my hair weighing it down<br />and causing frizz on the thinner front of my hair. My hairdresser confirmed that overuse<br />will build up the oil from the Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner. I have decided to use<br />it occasionally instead of every time I wash my hair. I will use Matrix Biolage advance Full<br />density shampoo and conditioner in between using the Argon shampoo and conditioner.\n",
      "1961->Burning Itching Staining | 1 | 4 | Used on bedridden adult for the past 2 yrs. Last purchased 2 cases on May 1, 2022.<br /><br />Recently noticed staining on patient's skin. Patient experienced burning and severe itching.  Discovered that the wipes were part of one of a number of bad lots that Walmart pulled off shelves back in April. Walmart was quiet about this and has not issued a recall. Bad lots are still floating around. See image for lot numbers.<br /><br />Switched to Pampers Sensitive Perfume Free wipes. More expensive but no adverse reactions.\n",
      "1964->Good..Better Than Most | 3 | 4 | They are O...K.  Basic product.  My complaint is they come apart fairly easily as you are rolling them with hair.  I wish a USA company would manufacture them and make them more durable.<br />My hair hates heat & chemicals. These give my hair curl, body & still soft & natural. When they stay together\n",
      "1965->Dangerous Ingredients - Several Potential Carcinogens | 1 | 4 | Not only did I not see any significant results with this bust cream (that is actually more of a balm than a cream) but it also contains several potentially harmful ingredients. As stupid as this may sound, I went ahead and tried the product anyway. Judge me as you wish, but please read this review and its entirety so that you may make a careful and truly informed decision on whether or not to purchase this cream.<br /><br />Before I discuss the ingredients, I'd like to discuss the product itself. The &#34;cream&#34; is very thick—like a lip balm. It smells sweet and soft, but it has petroleum undertones which concerned me a little. That's why I decided to research the ingredients. As for the effectiveness of the product, it does not deliver. I followed the instructions (that were clearly not written by a Native English speaker and are somewhat difficult to understand) and applied this cream twice a day for a week. After those 7 days, there were no significant results—no changes in breast size or firmness.<br /><br />Please, please, please do your research prior to buying cosmetics so that you know what you're putting on your body. Your skin is your body's largest organ and it absorbs these chemicals, which can lead to several health issues over long periods of use. The ingredients in this bust cream are highly questionable, ones that I would advise you stay away from.<br /><br />Around 33% of the ingredients in this bust cream are potentially harmful, especially for use on the skin. I've outlined the harmful ingredients below, so that you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />- Petroleum Distillates<br />Gasoline is a petroleum distillate, along with several other fuels including kerosene. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) states that petroleum distillates are exposed to the body via &#34;inhalation, ingestion, skin and/or eye contact and feature symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose, and/or throat; dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea; dry cracked skin.&#34; Petroleum distillates are a &#34;possible human carcinogen.&#34; They are actually prohibited or restricted for use in cosmetics in Europe.<br /><br />- Ceteareth-20<br />According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), Ceteareth-20 &#34;may contain potential toxic impurities such as 1,4-dioxane.&#34; The EWG also recommends that consumers stay away from products containing these ingredients, stating that it may have the potential to contaminate certain products with carcinogens. Any moisturizers that contain this ingredient should include a warning that it is not safe to use on injured or damaged skin. Unfortunately, this Jaowying Bust Cream does not contain any such warning.<br /><br />- DMDM Hydantoin<br />This ingredient was the most concerning for me. According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), DMDM Hydantoin has been &#34;proven to be a human skin toxicant and allergen with strong evidence to approve such.&#34; Why a company would want to include this ingredient in a skin product is beyond me. It is a formaldehyde donor, which means it is a derivative of formaldehyde (embalming fluid). The chemical has been linked to allergies, chest pain, fatigue, depression, headaches, and may even cause cancer.<br /><br />Again, I cannot stress enough how important it is that you make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body and health.<br /><br />* Product provided free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review.\n",
      "1966->New skin who dis | 5 | 4 | These are life changing. Be careful, they're rougher than you'd expect, but that's what makes them so wonderful. For a gentler scrub, roll it into a burrito and put soap on it. Use it in one layer for brand new silky soft skin. Keep it long so you can reach your back.<br />08/20/17<br />I'm still obsessed with these washcloths. My legs are silky smooth and I have much less ingrowns now. My skin has built up a tolerance for how scrubby these are but I still encourage you to start gently. Rolling them up definitely makes them more gentle. They dry so fast, making them amazing for travel. Some people use them on their face but it would be far too rough for mine.\n",
      "1967->Amazing but not worth the price | 4 | 4 | My significant other has been trying so many products lately to try and soften up his beard and while some work great others are not so good. When he takes a shower his hair shampoo will sometimes dry out his beard and the oils and balms and conditioners won’t work as well. We live in a very hot dry climate so it dries out a lot faster and is becoming very coarse to the point it scratches my face. He will try just about anything I get him and he gave it a thumbs up. It was easy to apply and rinse and after a few days his beard had gotten back to being soft and comb worthy. We tend to go with unscented products but this one isn’t so bad. We have the entire line of wild willies and they all go great together. The other reviewers are right when they saying it leaves a tingle at the end which I push up to the Eucalyptus.<br /><br />Overall this product is great as super easy to use but I do suggest using it sparingly and in small amounts. You don’t need a lot.<br /><br />The price is the only problem we have. I don’t think we can consistently pay full price so this may just have to be a summer gift for us.\n",
      "1969->Cheap qauality, they do not work. | 1 | 4 | Cheap qauality, they do not work.<br />These are very cheap magnetic lashes. They rip out your eyelashes when you are trying to get them on and off. They do not look natural by any means. I think they are rather ugly I will stick to eyelash extensions and regular strip lashes.<br />They also stick to the tape and fray when you are trying to get them out of the little box<br />I do not recommend<br />Pictures attached\n",
      "1978->Love the way this worked on my very kinky curly hair | 5 | 3 | After shampooing and conditioning my hair, I used this One N Only Brazilian Tech Keratin Smoothing lotion with the One N Only Brazilian Tech Keratin Leave In Treatment on my damp hair and then blow dried it straight with a round brush. I then flat ironed my hair in small sections and the results were wonderful. My hair had bounce and shine and held up even in 90 degree humid weather with drizzling rain. Normally, my hair would have frizzed out and been puffy. Didn't happen though; my hair remained bouncy and straight. Just what I wanted!<br /><br />As a side note - I separated my hair into about 6 sections and applied the smoothing lotion, then brushed it through with a wide-toothed rubber bristle brush. I then sprtized the leave in treatment throughout my hair. After I did that, I was worried that I messed up by combining the two products because my hair felt like it had a film on it. I was anxious that would make my hair dull. But it didn't at all. After blow drying and flat ironing my hair, it was shiny and soft.<br /><br />I'm happy with the One N Only Brazilian Tech products and will definitely continue using them.\n",
      "1991->making my face very dry. | 2 | 3 | disappointed... so far seems to be making my skin very dry. :-( Not noticing anything great about it so far....<br /><br />UPDATE: Absolutely no results. My skin has become terribly dry AND I find it highly suspect all of these glowing reviews...:-&lt;\n",
      "2020->Like, but don't love | 4 | 3 | These pads come in a double-sealed container. There's the screw top lid you open to find a pop top lid with a little tweezer on top to get the pads.<br /><br />The pads are very thin and flimsy...I have a hard time sliding them around on my face unless I use 2 or more. One side is textured and the other is smooth. The pads are extremely wet, as in dripping, so there's plenty of essence on them. It takes a while for my face to dry because of this. I don't detect a scent, nor is there any tingling or anything when I apply.<br /><br />These dry out my combo-oily/acne-prone/aging skin, so I must use a moisturizer after my face dries or I get that tight feeling and \"pull\" marks on my cheeks. These add no moisturization at all to my skin. The good news is these pads do tighten up the looks of my pores and are helping to keep acne at bay.<br /><br />As long as moisturizer is used after this step, I like these.\n",
      "2033->Smells like artificial flowers and dirt | 2 | 3 | The pro(s): mist is very fine and light which is very refreshing! Also, the scent lingers for awhile which is actually a negative for me but could be a positive to others. Note: I don't know how long the scent lasts because I wash it off after about an hour each time I used it. It smells horrible to me.<br /><br />Cons: the smell; it doesn't smell like plumeria to me. It's smells like artificial flowers and dirt. When used as a face mist, body spray, and a linen spray, it loses most of the floral scent after a couple of minutes and just smells like dirt.<br />If you're expecting this to smell sweet (like B&BW plumeria) don't waste your money but if you're into the earthy, artificial flower scent then this is the fragrance for you!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this scent to a friend but I would recommend the product.\n",
      "2040->It's okay. | 3 | 3 | .<br /><br />Wow, it looks like I'm part of a small minority here! I'm happy that this product works for all the 5- and 4-star reviewers. For me...meh.<br /><br />For starters, this feels greasy on my skin and takes longer than other moisturizers to absorb. Certainly, it is an &#34;okay&#34; moisturizer, hence the three stars. (&#34;It's okay.&#34;) But for me, it's sure nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I very much like the flip-top tube -- very quick and easy to open and dispense with one hand. The texture is nice. And I do appreciate the absence of scent. But an hour after I've applied it, my face feels no different than itI did before I put it on.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that I have researched the use and effects of ceramide on skin, and it does seem that, in certain strengths and when used with certain other ingredients, ceremides can help skin retain moisture. So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one. I can't recommend it as a great moisturizer, and I honestly don't know how it gets such terrific views, but that's the nature of skin care: what works for some doesn't work for others. I just can't see this one as being any kind of a magic bullet.\n",
      "2042->Meh.. | 2 | 3 | Product arrived fine.  Lid is difficult to remove so have left it completely off.<br />Smaller than I imagined; measure out the size to see if you want something that small.  It's fine for a little girl but, think I will find another container with a larger area and larger puff.  Overall, the product is fine for what it is.\n",
      "2052->Product is great; but the packaging needs to be fixed... | 4 | 3 | - As I noted in the title, the *product* is as described.  I use it for various things, not my hair (what little there is of it, LOL!), but it's a good strong peroxide for those NON-health instances where one needs a good strong peroxide.<br /><br /> - The one problem is with the packaging:<br />The caps are just half a hair's width too long for the neck of the bottle, and that's why people have had problems with leaking bottles.  If just maybe 1/16th of and inch is shaved off the bottom of the cap, it screws down tightly and No More Leaks.  I might have cut a bit more or a bit less off of my cap; I didn't measure it exactly, but it proved the principle.<br /> - Anyway, if just a shorter cap was used for packaging, it would prevent leaks.\n",
      "2055->Convenient | 2 | 3 | 8/24/21 Update: So I've applied it this weekend and it does stay on for a couple hours but doesn't last all day and with that being said I highly doubt it's waterproof. It wasn't on long enough for me to try it. I've tried different stencils and the shapes suck. I gave 2 stars instead of one because it still is better than just using a brush, but still have to fix the end with a brush.<br /><br />8/17/21 -It's very convenient but the shape of the stencils sucked. None of them have an actual pointy end, they're all rounded. I only tried one brow but I will updated after the weekend to see if the waterproof part actually works\n",
      "2058->Decent designs, old product | 3 | 3 | All the designs are old product, discontinued. Out of all of the designs I just didn't care for one. I got a glitter set... That set barely came off the plastic and I almost didn't get my nails done.<br />The other set took some skill but looked nice. So far I've only worked with 2 of the designs.\n",
      "2065->serves for what I bought it | 4 | 3 | I use only a soft side of it.<br />Do not see how the other side<br />would be useful to me.<br />The reach is good and the quality<br />does not diminish with time.\n",
      "2081->Excellent dripper wick for your atomizer | 5 | 3 | Just replaced my wick with this, and I am impressed by the speed of absorption while using 70VG/30PG juice. My old wick pads would take a minute of two to pull in fresh juice when new; this cotton draws in a drop in about three seconds from completely dry.<br /><br />I tried loading the other side of my deck from the bottom trough, and the wick pulled all the way up through the coil in about thirty seconds. Not bad!<br /><br />Taste is pretty good. Got a faint hint of fresh laundry on the first hit or two, but that died down quickly.\n",
      "2082->Why don't the plastic stay put | 1 | 3 | There is no way for me to keep this little piece of plastic between the brush.  I think I may need to return this brush/comb.  Once the little plastic comes off each individual it pulls and pop the hair.  This little plastic piece didn't come with directions either.<br /><br />Update still no call from seller 11/19/2019\n",
      "2084->Better to go to the salon | 1 | 3 | This is my husband’s account.<br />I always spend more time and money on my nails and this poly gel nails were everywhere on my social media tempting me to buy one kit though I haven’t done this before. The Ads were so deceiving that this is a piece of cake. But I almost cried by the time I finished all my fingers in both hands and gave up for the toes. There is no guide along with the kit to follow. The poly gel tends to harden more when left in room temperature. And gets all sticky and messy everywhere with the slipping solution. It took me 4 hours just for the hands.  I’d rather go to the salon and get decent nail extensions done. I’m sorry. But I wouldn’t recommend this at home.\n",
      "2090->Pretty. Not much product. | 4 | 3 | Update:<br />This primer is really growing on me. I've tried acouple other's since making my 1st review, and it makes me appreciate this primer much more. It's very smooth, and silky going on. Leaves, a very mellow, yet bright look on your eyes, which looks really pretty alone! Eyeshadow go's on smoothly over it, and I do think it helps it pop the color out. It's not tacky on your eyes like some. I would say it's better by itself, and to help making the application of eyeshadow easier, and help's shadow stand out. It does dry quick. The con's are, I can't really tell a difference in my eye makeup, or shadow lasting longer. &, I do still wish it came with more, because it doesn't last long at all. I only wear makeup once in a while, and I've already ordered another one, after 5 or 6 wears, and I probably have maybe, 5 or so wears left. Maybe! It's hard to tell because of the shape of the bottle. Will update when it's actually gone. If you're planning to use it daily, I'd say it will be hard to keep it in stock. I think I'm going to only use it by itself, when I don't want eyeshadow over it, so I can stretch it out, because that's my favorite thing about how this primer looks. Wish they offered a bigger size. Or, anymore at all. They're sold out as I'm writing this, and my 2nd bottle hasn't arrived, yet. Almost ordered 2 more, and I wish I would have now.<br /><br />Original 2 star review, upon arrival, before actual use...<br />Came really quick. Still has 33 days left on estimated time. Came within the week. Packaged very good. A little too good, and hard to open. Product is in a pretty bottle. I am a little disappointed with how much product there is, however. It's also kinda thick down in the bottle, and looks like it could dry out fast. I haven't done my eye makeup, yet, so can't speak on the quality of the product as a primer. I will update once I do my eye makeup. I would give more stars if it had come with a little more product. :(\n",
      "2098->Not suitable for large heads. | 4 | 3 | Im preparing for chemo. I really like this wig but I have a jug head. 🤣 and it does not fit. I also have thick hair so Im hoping that after my hair falls out it will.<br />Its a really nice wig. The hair is soft and brushable.<br />I want to make it work so bad but if it doesnt ill just give it to my sister who likes to wear wigs for fashion.\n",
      "2099->Great option for dry/sensitive eyes! | 4 | 3 | I rate this a 10/10 for dry or sensitive eyes. I have extremely dry/painful eyes and this is the only mascara I’ve been able to tolerate. This mascara is so light and gentle that my eyes actually feel bare and I forget I’m wearing any eye makeup at all!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- No crumbles, clumps, or flakes<br />- Shiny, smooth, gel-like appearance<br />- Comfortable and non-irritating<br />- Very natural looking<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No noticeable lift or curl<br />- Doesn’t add very much length<br />- Smudges easily<br /><br />Overall, I think this mascara is great, especially if you suffer from dry eyes!<br /><br />Currently, this is the only mascara my eyes can tolerate, so even though I wish it gave me a little bit more length, I’m just so grateful that I can finally wear some form of eye makeup again! :)\n",
      "2101->Love! | 4 | 3 | First, I'll say this: this is a beautiful set of brushes, and I absolutely love them. It was like Christmas morning, opening this package!  However, the largest brush got incorrectly placed in the packaging at the manufacturing/assembly point (see photo), and the bristles on that side are now misshapen.  Obviously, that will affect the performance of the brush, and I'm not going to mess with washing it and trying to reshape the bristles (which probably won't work anyway).  So I ordered another set, and the first defective one will be returned.  Hopefully, the second one will be better.  I docked a star for this, but if the second one comes in better shape, and the brushes hold up long-term (or don't), I may change my rating.<br /><br />EDIT: Ordered a second one, but waited to send back the first one.  So glad I did.  The replacement was in worse shape than the first, with THREE brushes shifted out of place and potentially crimped in the same way (see photo).  So I didn't even open it, I just sent the second one back.  More care needs to be taken by the seller and manufacturer.  If you don't mind dealing with this type of hassle, try them.  I'm hoping that my large brush's shape self-corrects after I wash it for the first time.\n",
      "2110->Very  Pleasing  Effects | 4 | 3 | Good face scrub, especially for  oily skin.<br /><br />It smells great and leaves the skin feeling very clean.<br /><br />It was recommended to me by a friend  who has dry skin ! (worked for him too).<br /><br />Highly recommended and perfect for summer use.\n",
      "2116->Shame on you, Barbasol | 2 | 3 | I just checked to make sure this latest shipment was a reorder of the same product I've ordered several times before. It was the best I had found. HOWEVER, Barbasol has seen fit to substitute a different, flimsier, cheaper, less efficient razor in the exact same packaging.<br /><br />Once these new crap razors are gone, I'll be back to shopping for something better.<br /><br />Check the photo. The previous product is on the left with a solid handle. The new one is hollowed out, presumably to cut plastic costs. What you can't see is the difference in the blade heads. The old one has a wider range of swivel, so it follows the curvatures of the face/chin better than the new El Cheapo razor.<br /><br />This is a Barbasol trend. They've reduced the amount of foam in a can by 30% (10 oz down to 7 oz). Now this.<br /><br />Shame on you Barbasol.\n",
      "2122->Good buy | 4 | 3 | Very good hair. No clumping knotting or shedding.<br />I didn't do a review right away because I wanted to see how the hair will act after wash and reinstall, second time installing and still in decent condition. However, i don't think it's virgin hair reason being; the chemical order, and after I pre washed it the hair waved up. (In a body wave pattern)<br />No other complaints will definitely order again especially for the price\n",
      "2123->THIS WORKS! This is coming from someone who's skin irritates SUPER easy! | 5 | 3 | I bought this product along with the coochy cream shave system (I still laugh saying the name!). I used to wax and was aware of the sales pitches of &#34;serums&#34; that helped with ingrown hairs. I don't know if they made a difference for me, but when it came to this product I figured I was either going to buy the entire system or nothing at all.<br /><br />I'm glad I did!<br /><br />This product is used AFTER shaving! I was nervous about spraying on a freshly shaved...area (LOL), but it did not sting or cause discomfort. As a matter of fact, it made my skin even smoother and made my clothes glide over that area like silk!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend!\n",
      "2126->Should've Bought this sooner **Update Dries Scalp | 2 | 3 | I've been using Dove and Head n Shoulders for a while. Since switching to this product, I am very satisfied with my decision. I have fine hair and though I've just recently started using the product, I feel like its giving my hair a more natural thick look. After showering and blow drying, it gives my hair a nice volumized bed head.<br /><br />Update 5/17/17*** was 5 stars<br />Okay so I've been using this for about 3 months now, conditioner is not helping the dandruff. At first I was thinking maybe its because my scalp has to get use to the new shampoo and conditioner its been 3 months. flakes and dandruff all day. I switched back over and shoulders and my dandruff and flaking is gone. It maybe just me, but I would not purchase this product again. Also, being 3 months in, their is no signs of thicken for my hair, if anything, the dryness may be damaging it more.\n",
      "2134->Exfoliating version is back!!!  Now they have two varieties - one with and one without exfoliation | 5 | 3 | *** UPDATE Nov 9 2015 ***<br />They have now added the exfoliating version back, in another listing.  That means people who love this soap for whatever other reasons without the exfoliation can give it 5 stars for that.  People like me, who can't find strong exfoliating soap from any other brand (I have specifically ordered at least 10 other brands, Loofah, etc. etc. just trying to find one with strong exfoliation - and none have it, except maybe Tasmanian (http://amzn.com/B00CQOHOXY (but this is better)), can now use Honest For Men again - their exfoliating line.  So not this listing, but the other listing.  Not that exfoliating soap should matter, but actually, I'd be scrubbing with rocks from brooks if humans lived out in nature.<br /><br />*** Original review a few days before ***<br /><br />This was my favorite soap - and I depended on it for the fantastic exfoliation, better than any other I've tried (and I tried a dozen kinds).<br /><br />All of a sudden, in this last batch, they have simply removed the exfoliation completely.  Now, when you look at the website, it says &#34;Important Information: We have recently removed our exfoliating oats and coffee grounds due to customer feedback. Our scent is now 100% essential oils no fragrance oil.&#34;<br /><br />Well, I'm here to give you a 1 star review for this &#34;important information&#34;.  There are 1,000 other soaps that you can buy with various interesting scents, etc.  But this was the only soap you can buy that had great exfoliation.<br /><br />And now they've removed it.<br /><br />Hopefully, the 'customer feedback' that caused them to remove the exfoliation will be blasted away by the customer feedback complaining that the exfoliation is missing, and they'll put it back.<br /><br />In the meantime - goodbye, 'Honest for Men'.\n",
      "2135->Cheaper elsewhere | 3 | 3 | These wipes do work. Sometimes I have to use a torch to heat up the tool and then use these to wipe it clean..<br />The reason for the 3 star -<br />It's $46 for a pack of 10 on terp wipes' site\n",
      "2139->Not fine hair friendly | 4 | 3 | Honestly I’m not sure that it does anything. Lol I have fine, wavy hair and live in Florida. I feel like it does define my curls but if I go for one extra pass it makes frizz worse. Also the “massage” effect is worthless.<br /><br />Update: I’ve had this brush for a while now but lately it’s had the true test. I have blunt cut bangs, and the last few days every time I straighten them (I have wavy hair) they have static. I comb them and my hair follows the comb. I broke out this brush, turned it on, combed my bangs and static was instantly gone. I’m now convinced it works.\n",
      "2142->Nice idea, but not easy to use on long hair | 4 | 3 | I like the idea of this product as an eco friendly alternative to bottled conditioner, shampoo, etc. It smells absolutely amazing. That being said, it's not super easy to use on long hair. It takes me several minutes to lather enough conditioner off the bar to just somewhat coat my hair.<br />This next part is in regards to my hair results after using this for a few weeks. Note that I have very curly, frizzy, dry hair and have never found a product that has actually helped any of those.<br />My hair feels very light after using this conditioner, which is nice but it also means it's not doing anything for my frizz. Right after getting out of the shower, my hair doesn't feel particularly soft as it has with other conditioners, but once my hair is dry, it feels as soft as it normally does. The scent from the conditioner usually completely goes away by the time my hair is dry, take that as you will. The ends of my hair have been getting more tangled than normal and I often find multiple tiny knots that often won't brush out and end up breaking. I'm no expert on hair so I don't know if this is due to the conditioner not doing what it needs to do or if my hair is just ready to be trimmed again. Either way, it started shortly after switching to this conditioner.<br />Overall, I do plan on sticking with bar conditioner to reduce waste but may look into other options to see if I can get better results.\n",
      "2145->works well | 4 | 3 | I'm typically a bit skeptical about how well a straightener brush will work, but this one did a pretty decent job. I didn't snap any pictures but it did leave my hair mostly straight in a pretty fast time frame. A flat iron would have left it straighter but would have taken longer so this is a nice alternative. I have thick, curly hair. I did use a heat spray on my hair when I straightened it so that might have helped some. The LCD screen was a bit annoying, the temp didn't change smoothly so I just left it on a certain temp and went with it.<br /><br />I did receive this for a discounted price for my fair and unbiased review. I do not guarantee a 5 star review in exchange for the discount.\n",
      "2150->Contains a potent irritant. | 2 | 3 | I just bought this same product at my local drug store, and I realized it has different ingredients than the information available on amazon and even different than the ingredient listing on the drug store site. I am assuming the ingredients were changed at some point and information has not been changed. Here is a listing of the new ingredients:<br />Aqua, Soybean Oil, Glycerin, Polyquaternium-37, Olive Oil, Limonene, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Orange Oil, Quaternium-80, Panthenol, Silk Amino Acids, Dimethicone PEG-7 Isotearate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Chamomile Extract, Sage Extract, Nettle Extract, Rosemary Extract, Aloe Leaf Extract, Yarrow Extract, Kiwi Fruit Extract, Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140.<br /><br />I read the ingredients list before purchase and was attracted to this product because it contains Hydrolyzed Collagen, Panthenol, Silk Amino Acids, and some interesting natural extracts. I am highly allergic to many fragrances and I didn't see any fragrance listed and assumed this product relied on its natural extracts for its scent. Boy was I wrong... as soon as I popped the bottle BAM I was hit with a very strong, artificial-seeming citrus scent. Bad news for me, since strong citrus scents notoriously cause allergies and irritation. See that Limonene listed up there? High up in the ingredients list? I referred to some references for cosmetic ingredients and found a bunch of red flags about how it causes allergies, sensitizes skin and can cause contact dermatitis. Yikes. I am having mild allergies flaring up after using this product and I know if I use it frequently and regularly the allergies will only get worse, and quickly. It is a shame because my hair does feel very nice after using this product.  I will be returning this in the morning. So, I gave it more than one star because yes, it is nice on my hair, however I am cutting the rating substantially because this product contains a potentially very irritating and allergenic ingredient that has no benefit to the hair aside from providing the product with a certain scent..\n",
      "2156->Doesn't Leave Skin Sticky | 5 | 3 | I use lots of sheet masks. Most leave your skin a little sticky when the serum dries. This mask works differently. The sheet locks the moisture in and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "2161->Please, please DON’T buy! | 1 | 3 | Well my feet are peeling, but I must say.. I’m nervous.<br />I truly, honestly remember this product being a 4 or 5 star product(I only order 4 or 5 star products), I’m confused and a little worried now that after reading about these reviews being for sunglasses (“These are great”)<br />and there are NO ingredients on the package.<br />My feet currently are 3 days in, and Though they are peeling, they are also very dry(like dryer than they already were). I will update in a few days, but I ask that the seller/owner either puts the actual ingredients on the box or on the packs.<br />I would honestly say don’t buy this product, till the owner/seller lists the ingredients. It’s says it’s “natural botanical ingredients” but they could just be saying that, there is nothing listed saying otherwise.<br /><br />This is the next day, um, I am so angry.<br />My healthy big toe nail cracked and fell off and it’s painful.<br />DO NOT USE this product.<br />Update:<br />It’s been almost a month since I used this product. My feet are still very dry, and my nail is slowly starting to grow back. I told Amazon to take this product off their website but obviously they haven’t listened which disappoints me because I truly believe that this product could be harmful.<br />The company never got in contact to apologize. I got a refund from Amazon, but I don’t care about the money.. I don’t want this product available for people to buy because we don’t know what is actually in this product.<br />Update:<br />It’s been over a month since I purchased and tried this product. I have lost three toe nails, I’m not even joking when I say I am so disgusted and disappointed by Amazon to not have taken this product down.<br />I encourage you to buy your beauty products in a store so you can KNOW what is in your products. I feel deceived, and quite frankly- the time it’s going to take and the pain my feet have been in because of cracked or missing toe nails is extremely inconvenient. I am constantly afraid that my toes are going to get infected.<br />Don’t buy it!<br />I provided a newer photo of the two photos that had recently fallen off, stop buying this product.\n",
      "2168->brilliant colors, just what I wanted them to look like | 5 | 3 | actually I purchased this for using on my face for Halloween<br />I am too old to wear colors like this, but will find someone who<br />can use them after I am done, or will use with my art work.\n",
      "2181->Nice...but not exactly as shown... | 1 | 3 | Update-the caps/nozzles are not snug enough on the bottle. When you pull off the clear cap (over spray nozzle) the ENTIRE spray nozzle pulls right out of the bottle.  It doesn't stay snug on bottle threads. Horrible bottles. Mine are headed for the trash can.<br />I like these bottles since they are plastic instead of glass.  Perfect for my use.  Size is great.  BUT.... the plastic &quot;hose&quot; inside doesn't even reach the bottom of the bottle.  They are at least 1/4&quot; from the bottom.  It will waste a lot of product in each bottle.  Picture shows the &quot;hose&quot; being so long as it wraps around just a bit.  Definitely reaching the bottom of bottle.  And, in packaging - which they were just thrown in box - a couple of the bottles have arrived with scratches in them.  They don't appear &quot;new&quot; when they arrive this way.  If I were selling something in them, it would be unacceptable to me.<br />UPDATE 2/18/16 These bottles are going from a 3 star to a zero rating, as far as I am concerned.  After I filled these with some e.oil air spray, I found that the nozzles LEAK to no end.  With just one or two sprays, there is fluid running down the nozzle and bottle soaking my hand.  Not a good feature when you want to sit them on granite or wood surface.  This little bottle will ruin those surfaces.  If I had discovered this a week or two earlier, I'd send them back.  Beware\n",
      "2204->The best a man can get! | 5 | 3 | Oh, yes it is!<br /><br />Anyone who says otherwise probably hasn't given it the money back guarantee time for the skin to adjust.<br /><br />Not quite as close as a blade, but with a beard as heavy as mine (& with sensitive skin to boot), who cares?! The wife agrees, and if that isn't good enough..<br /><br />Buy a refurbished one for about half price at Goodman's - also through Amazon.\n",
      "2209->Fall apart | 2 | 3 | Looking for less expensive wipes and found these. Eww<br />Just spend the extra $2.00  and get the Amazon Elements brand vs these.  These are basically fall apart wet paper towels stuffed in a container. Terrible. I will never buy these again.<br />I'm disappointed because normally  'Parents Choice\" brand is decent.\n",

      "2221->Disapointed | 2 | 3 | I thought it had a small nib on the other end, but it doesn't. Have to be carful because it can be very messy.<br />Not to young kids.\n",
      "2222->Not Obsessed with this one. | 2 | 3 | Smells NOTHING like Obsession.<br />I am giving 2 stars because the oil is nice and soft and the scent is a nice scent that is along the same lines as Obsession but not similar at all.\n",
      "2224->Love | 5 | 3 | These are kinda expensive but I feel are worth the price compared to other bows on amazon. If you are looking for a huge bow this is the one. The band on the headband is super wide and I can see getting many years out of this headband due to the size of the bow and stretch of the material. I would<br />Highly recommend this product. I have purchased two already. One red polka dot and one orange polka dot.\n",
      "2225->Good for what you pay for | 3 | 3 | I like to fashion myself as sort of a cologne connoisseur…….a man’s man who just really likes to smell good all the time. I began wearing cologne shortly after I started my first job in high school, and ever since then I have been enamored with finding great smelling colognes. When I saw this cologne, and I read what it was inspired by, I felt that it was almost a must have for me.<br /><br />The first and most obvious reason most of us on here purchased this cologne is because it is inspired by Ralph Lauren Polo Red; and since that cologne is fairly pricey, undoubtedly most of us felt they were going to get a sweet deal. Now, you may ask what is the difference between this and the legitimate cologne that you would pay 60$ or more for?<br /><br />The first thing to know is that this cologne does not smell exactly like Polo Red at all. In fact, it is very loosely inspired by the actual scent. I challenge anyone to buy and smell the original cologne, then buy and smell this and tell me it’s exactly the same thing. Sorry folks, this just isn’t the same smell. It does, however, share similarities with the Polo Red…..which makes it enticing, but it just is not the same thing.<br /><br />The main issue that I have with this cologne is that it simply does not last more than an hour at best. I now understand why you get a 3.0-ounce bottle for 15$, and that is because you are constantly reapplying it to keep the smell fresh. With a normal (and quality) cologne I can go pretty much the extent of my eight-hour shift at work and still smell relatively fresh, but this cologne honestly started fading at about 20-30 minutes after application.<br /><br />In the end this may not bother folks who just want something cheap to make them smell good for a little while. Heck, even I like the way it smells at first. The problem for those of us who fashion ourselves fragrance snobs is that the scent just fades away too quickly.<br /><br />If affordability is what you look for in a cologne, then by all means this is your product. I, however, would just suggest spending the extra couple of bucks and buying the real deal. I can’t see how anyone would be disappointed with that at all.\n",
      "2227->High Expectations | 3 | 3 | After reading a lot of the reviews and purchasing this cream that is paraben and phthalate free... I did have pretty high expectations considering my medical office owns the formula for a very similar cream with colloidal silver as a primary marketing ingredient. Unfortunately our cream is mineral oil based, which definitely has its pros and cons so I have decided to no longer use it myself.<br />I purchased this cream recently, and was very excited to use it. After the first few days I did come to realize the most dominant ingredient based on consistency, texture, and smell was the emulsifying wax. It feels like wet creamy wax - which is slightly bizarre and off-putting. The worst thing is it smells very much like wax. I wanted to use this on my face but wax will definitely clog up pores.<br />Looks like my search continues.\n",
      "2231->These are SOOOOOO pretty! The pictures do not do justice | 5 | 3 | These are SOOOOOO pretty!  The pictures do not do justice. The glitter part actually has a tasteful amount of tiny multicolor sparkles, which looks amazing in the sunlight and also so rich at night! I used as accent nails paired mine with solid black. The left hand (pic) has the accent on pointer and pinky; the right has the accent on thumb and ring finger.<br /><br />I love the Inoco brand. The color selection and quality are the best imo. Consider using a fast dry topcoat like Essie Good to Go to make these last up to 2 weeks.\n",
      "2249->NOT BROWN but auburn AND WAVY. | 3 | 3 | #3 silver is supposed to be DARK BROWN and silver. It is reddish brown and silver. Not even close to the pictures on 2 different screens. Definitely in the red family.<br /><br />Update: just put them in, sorta hard by myself but I've a broken ankle which doesnt help; the hair is consistently thick from top to bottom. That matters. If it were thinner on the ends, it'd have actually blended better with MY long hair. That said, I should've gotten 20&#34; as I underestimated my hair length. So I ended up trimming 2&#34; off of the thinner ends of MY hair and it has that kinda 'choppy' look. I like it! So far so good. I did use a hair dryer to warm up the adhesive and pinch tightly afterwords. Hope it'll last! But I'll get the black and silver next time.<br /><br />Another Update: this hair is NOT STRAIGHT hair. It is permanently tightly wavy. Need a straightener to make it straight. Lost another star, now a 3*. Should be 2* because it has failed its description.\n",
      "2251->Outstanding!! Smells Good! | 5 | 3 | This is probably one of the best, if not, THE BEST conditioner I've ever used in my life.<br />It made my hair FEEL like no other conditioner has ever made my hair feel.  Ever!  This stuff is made in Germany, for whatever that's worth.  My conditioner came in a nice box with NO insert.  So don't expect to get any \"promo\" info or instructions. The box has 5 words: \"rinse after 5-10 minutes.\"  I left the product in my hair for 20 minutes 'cause I didn't SEE the instructions until later (in tiny print).<br />Just use it and see and FEEL the difference in your hair.  You will NOT NEED a detangler either.  Hair comes out smooth as silk.<br />Good stuff!\n",
      "2252->Great product! | 5 | 3 | Good product! Nice price!<br />My girlfriend recommended this oil for me to use it for the skin and hair. I love it and will buy this product again.\n",
      "2262->Doesn't smell like the description | 2 | 3 | Husband thought he would try to get me a new perfume as one of my 40th bday gifts.<br /> It is what I feel like an older lady would like. Not anything like what I'd wear. I don't get hints of raspberry tones like description said either. I am pretty upset that most amazon scents have refunds but this one doesn't. I would NOT recommend blind buying a perfume they won't let you return. Now I have an overpriced paper weight.\n",
      "2272->Great Concept -- Needs Reworking | 3 | 3 | I fought with myself on rating because it could have easily been a five star, but there are a couple of deal breakers with me on this product.<br /><br />First let me say that I like the product. My face feels smoother after using it. It comes in a nice container that holds all of the attachments.<br /><br />Now -- in my humble opinion here the things that the manufacturer needs to do to improve the usability of it:<br /><br />1) Make it waterproof so that I can use it in the shower! This thing makes a huge mess on your counter. I don't care if you submerge your entire head in your sink with your nose in the drain, water will splatter everywhere. This makes me not want to use it because of the clean up necessary afterwards.<br /><br />2) Make an ON/OFF switch that is separate. Currently, there is one switch and it goes from slow to fast to off. Personally, I would have removed the fast altogether which would make the on/off switch unnecessary, but having to switch from slow to fast to off while having it on your face to avoid water splatter is a pain.<br /><br />3) Make the instruction booklet better. There are no pictures of the battery compartment. There are no notations on the unit that I can see that even give you a hint of where the batteries are which made it difficult to know where to start on putting the batteries in. If you made the unit waterproof and allowed for them to be recharged with electricity, the unit would be awesome because you could use it in the shower where you expect water and soap to splatter.\n",
      "2274->like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash; zero eye irritation, easy to wash off | 4 | 3 | I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, \"made for USA but made in China\", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive \"natural, healthy\" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes \"4D silk fiber lashes\", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.\n",
      "2276->Not so great | 2 | 3 | It works great for trimming. Don't expect It to shave you to skin. It is easy to use. It's easy to clean.

As many others have commented, it is a temporary effect, the same as you can get with glue.<br /><br />I also got snookered into getting this at a mall kiosk as a few others here have noted in their reviews. Always steer clear of any products where they have a &#34;No Refund&#34; policy. If it's a good product, they will absolutely give you a refund for an UNOPENED and unused product, which is what my case was.<br /><br />But of course, since this is a scam, they would not provide a refund.\n",
      "2285->Small with hard plastic and hinges that caught hair | 1 | 3 | The clips were much smaller than expected. The colored sections were hard plastic. Hinge grabbed hair even when I was very careful.<br />I think a dollar store might be better.\n",
      "2286->Minty & Cooling, Heavy & Doesn’t Absorb Well, Agitates My Sensitive Skin-Some Good Ingredients | 3 | 3 | ﻿I’m in my 50’s and have dry, sensitive skin and also have some contact allergies. This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.\n",
      "2288->Still have bags and will travel on. | 3 | 3 | After reading the stellar reviews and researching online I decided to give this product a try.<br /><br />Pro's: The roller ball releases the right amount of product and the cool serum feels really good.<br />  No under eye tugging with the application.<br />Con's: Expensive (but would have been worth the price if I saw results).<br />  Did not reduce my under eye puffiness.<br />I would recommend trying this product as a last resort, maybe it will work for you. I end up sleeping on my left side and wake with puffiness under my left eye. I used the product exactly as recommended with absolutely no noticeable difference. I will add remarks to my review if I see improvements.\n",

Unfortunately, I received the same hair clips as replacements and they also have those nubs on the underside of the ends that catch your hair and pull it out when removing them.  They wrote and said they would talk with their product department to look into it.  The hair clips are still bad, but the customer service is awesome!<br /><br />June 26, 2018:  These work okay but BEWARE!  About half of the have tiny metal nubs on the end and will catch your hair in them every time.  I can't say how much hair I've pulled out removing them.  I will get a different brand next time.\n",
      "2298->Semi-decent product, really crappy price | 3 | 3 | I've used this shampoo about three months now and I have mixed feelings on the product.<br /><br />I have very long, very thick hair that I get colored on a semi-regular basis (every four to six months or so). Coloring tends to dry and damage it, and it felt like I was pulling out a lot of hair every time I washed and brushed it. It could just be because it's so long it looks like a lot of hair, but I decided to take preventative measures, just in case.<br /><br />I tried some other products before this one, but for the price they cost, I didn't think they worked well enough or did what they claimed to do. So I thought I'd try this product because it was cheaper than the others. It lasts surprisingly long time. I use about six or seven pumps per wash and it lathers well enough to get all of my hair. One bottle has lasted me about three months.<br /><br />I have noticed that I seem to be pulling out less hair per wash, not the big clumps I used to, anyway. I can't tell whether there's any new growth or anything (honestly, I do NOT need it), but for the hair loss, it seems to work pretty well.<br /><br />I have, however, noticed an increase in dandruff since using this product. I never suffered from dandruff before, so not so sure I like that. It cleans well but I don't like that it dries out my scalp badly enough to cause flakes. I've been searching for a good conditioner to counteract that problem.<br /><br />Also, when I purchased this item, it was only around $18. Sometime in the last three months the price got jacked up to $35. I don't know why; I don't believe it's good enough to justify charging that amount of money. It lost a star for that and I think I'll look around a little more and try different products before committing to buy another bottle of this. Not unless they drop the price back to something way more reasonable.\n",
      "2318->Works well! | 5 | 3 | I truly love this product! I have used a similar scrub that came in an open bottle that you have to dip your fingers in and I LOVED that product. I was very very pleased that this product was squeezable so I could dispense it straight onto my fingers or back of my hand and I didn't have to dig into the pot and get the product under my fingernails. I also find the scrub very effective. It rejuvenates my skin and I can feel the dead layer of debris exfoliated off each time.<br />Some people have mentioned that it can get in your eyes and cause irritation. That is true, but you just have to give it a wide margin from your eyes and rinse it off thoroughly before opening your eyes. I like using it in the shower so that I can make sure it all is completely washed away.\n",
      "2330->Mixed Review | 3 | 3 | I have mixed opinions about this product. It is easy to use, and seems to be a decent quality. The multiple speed/power settings are nice. Product seems to stay clean when we’ll rinsed after use and battery lasts 1-2 weeks depending on usage. The negatives about the product are more geared towards the category. I was a little leery about it being able to replace a traditional toothbrush. After a couple few weeks of use I do not feel this item (and likely others the same style) are sufficient as a replacement for a standard toothbrush. It does however seem to do a decent job supplementing regular brushing if you only do that 1-2 times a day. Does a good job but doesn’t seem to be enough on its own. I will continue to use but will also continue to use a standard toothbrush as well for better gum health and plaque control.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have only used with standard toothpaste at this point. I have ordered toothpaste designed specifically for this type of product but have not yet received it. If it does change things, I will update my review.\n",
      "2332->Good wig for the price. | 3 | 3 | I bought this wig for a change of wearing my hair. Pros: The colors are nice and the wig was good for the price.<br />Cons: It has curly hair (a different texture) at the nape which causes it to stick out more than I like. Also it is shedding a little.<br /><br />Overall it is worth the cost and after I trimmed the bangs I like how it looks.\n",
      "2334->Where are the attachments? | 2 | 3 | This review is not about the product itself but the advertisement of the product.  The heading for the product reads:<br />\"BeautyBio GloPRO Tool & Microtip Attachment Heads\" which had me believe the other heads came with the tool.  They product only comes with one head and the others have to be purchased separately.  This is misleading.\n",
      "2338->What a “Cheeky” Product! 🍑 | 4 | 3 | I can honestly say that this was the first time I’ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I’m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it’s worth giving these a try!\n",
      "2339->Average face roller with nonfunctioning microcurrent. | 2 | 3 | Overall, the item feels premium and has a nice weight to it. The materials used are pretty nice and make it have a great feel when you touch it. The kneading balls are well lubricated at the base making them rotate with ease and never clunks around.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the unit I received does not have a functioning micro current. I put it under the sun for over a day and I couldn't feel a thing. The place where the solar chargers are almost look like just a dark plastic shell with nothing behind it. Either I received a defective unit or this product has a misleading aspect to it. In addition, it says the product comes with a velvet cloth which is something I never received inside my packaging.<br /><br />It's really an average product for its price point but I had to knock another star because off missing items and a nonfunctioning microcurrent.\n",
      "2351->I love these dense blenders & their flat angle which is perfect for smooth applications | 5 | 3 | This is a nice set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a reasonable $.85 per sponge.\n",
      "2379->It is nice and hard | 3 | 3 | This one does the job for my daughter hair in ballet class. But two ends that will clasp together is hard to push to close  or pull to open. It is working for the price very good compare to 10$ softer model that you can find in dance supply store in USA.<br />I have bought this item coupe of time from amazon. Not that they break but my doughter loose them more often.\n",
      "2397->Packaged so nicely and smell lovely! | 5 | 3 | These bath bombs are great, especially for the price. You get 18 bath bombs in the box. The box looks like a gift box, so these would make a great gift for someone special! ❤️<br /><br />The bath bombs are scented with essential oils and are very moisturizing. Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents. I personally think they smell wonderful!\n",
      "2402->Elevate for Facials! | 5 | 3 | I love having this Rose Quartz Roller Face Massager for applying all types of face masks and treatments to the face.<br /><br />When I put a facemask on I like to roll this over it. The rose quartz feels cool and it just feels so refreshing on the face and neck. It's also easy to clean which is nice.  I also apply some lotions / creams with it. I like to apply my hyaluronic acid with this. It seems like it works better than using my fingers alone.<br /><br />What has really impressed me though is the Microneedle Derma Roller. I only use it a few times a week but I really feel like it has helped with my dry flaky skin around my t-zone which has always been a problem for me. My face has never looked better!!\n",
      "2405->These stick to the applicator, not your lashes. | 2 | 3 | I was really excited to try these but unfortunately they don’t work at all. I can get the lashes aligned on the applicator and get them to click together over my lashes but when I pull the applicator away, they just stick to it. I’ve tried doing it every which way I can think of and they do not stay. I even try to hold them against my skin and no luck. I have average lashes for both length and thickness. Maybe they work if you already have super thick lashes but not on normal ones.<br /><br />UPDATED: The company did contact me to refund the money since the lashes didn’t work for me. I added back 1 star for good customer service.\n",
      "2412->GREASY & Medicinal Scent | 3 | 3 | I received this cream through the Amazon Vine Voice program.<br /><br />To be fair it has some lovely & highly skin loving ingredients. That earns the cream 3 Stars.<br /><br />BUT, it does have some cons as well. It's GREASY and doesn't absorb well. I have very dry skin and reside in an arid region, but this is waaay too greasy. Also, I realize the product says that it \"may separate\" BUT it separates a good amount, and I really don't want to stir it prior to usage. If I had known this in advance, I probably would not have tested/tried it. Also, there is NO preservative in this cream. Even with the note on the jar to use this within 3 months of opening, it isn't enough to apply that warning. This could collect bacteria soooo FAST just by the fact that it is an open mouth jar and anything on your fingers will contaminate it.<br /><br />I think they need to reformulate this one & make some improvements. Too bad because it has awesome potential to be a good cream with many of the listed ingredients.\n",
      "2426->Not for people with over bite. | 3 | 3 | I like the idea of this product and I know this can work for some people....but it is not for everyone.<br />I have a bit of an overbite. And this is made for someone who dose not have a overbite. If the bite's pressure is not squarely one on top of the other then, the teeth push out forward a little with unequal force. So this can make your overbite worse. My top teeth got more sore than my jaw after a few days, which means it's begining to move my teeth out forward more. So I gave this to my friend, who has perfect teeth and she has no problems.\n",
      "2441->Not so much a pore minimizer | 3 | 3 | I was so excited to try this product and I am not impressed to say the least. I have large pores on my cheek, forehead, and nostrils, and after two weeks of using this product 2x per day, I haven’t noticed any difference. Obviously I don’t expect change to happens overnight, so I will keep using it until I run out and update my review with any new findings. I will say though, the scent is mild and pleasant, and is the consistency. It’s labeled like clay but it’s a bit looser than clay. I do like that part and it has a very light tingle. It does not warm if that’s what you’re expecting. I feel very clean after washing and it leaves a layer of moisture on your skin so you feel silky under the water. Overall, Unless I start to see a change in my pore size, I feel like there are other product just as well suited to clean my face if that’s all it’s good for.<br /><br />Update 1- after a few days of posting this review I can’t attest to any new findings yet as far as effectiveness, however, I thought it worth mentioning to add that the pump dries out. The clay crusts over and the pump gets stuck. 1 you only end up getting one small pump out of it and 2 the hole where the product release has clumpy dried up clay too and clogs super easy so not much comes out without poking a hole in it first. The pump design wasn’t a genius move for a clay like product. Poor design in that aspect.\n",
      "2442->Very nice for various pairs of lashes\\ | 4 | 3 | really well constructed.  the gold background makes it a little hard to discern which lashes are where  if different styles are stored.<br />Very nice for various pairs of lashes\\\n",
      "2449->*****Formerly Skeptical***** | 5 | 3 | I've reviewed this single pack of this before but I wanted to ***update*** so EVERYONE knows....THIS STUFF REALLY DOES WORK!!!!<br />I ran out a few weeks ago and in an effort to save a little money, I thought I'd just buy chlorophyll caplets. That's an anti-stinky ingredient in Body Mint.<br />~~FYI~~ it DOES NOT work! So I came back today to reorder Body Mint and to post my Public Service Announcement to alert everyone who's on the fence about buying this...BUY IT! It works!\n",
      "2451->Faint scent, too oily, great for dry patches of skin though | 3 | 3 | Grapefruit scrub for the body and face.  This scrub has ingredients that helps clean your pours and remove toxins.  It can help brighten up your skin and leave a nice healthy fresh glow.  This scrub is rich in essential oils which have many benefits.  The scrub can strengthen your skin and give you protection against more damage from the elements.  The natural salts help exfoliate your skin.  This grapefruit scrub arrived on time and was packaged well.  It didn't have any wrapping around it but there was a top seal to it that you have to take off before use.  It doesn't smell much like grapefruit to me.  It's a little bit bland.  I expected it to be very citrus-y and yummy smelling but it isn't.  It's a very faint grapefruit scent.  I used it and it feels okay on the skin.  It exfoliates well.  The scrub was very hard to remove and it left my skin very oily feeling.  I had to wash the oil off of my skin.  I tried it on some dry skin areas and it does help those areas.  It exfoliates the dry skin and leaves a nice softness to those areas.  That is what I will continue using this product for as the oil feeling is just too much on already healthy skin.  Overall I found this body scrub to be too oily but works great on dry areas.  It also doesn't have a strong scent.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful.\n",
      "2455->Excellent mustache and beard comb | 5 | 3 | Great comb.  This is my first mustache and beard comb.  Based on the quality, this should also be my last mustache comb.  All of the edges are properly rounded.  It has a pleasant scent.  My beard oil and cream clean out of it easily.<br /> You can purchase more expensive ones, but no need to spend the extra money.\n",
      "2466->More concerned about buying from amazon, used product | 2 | 3 | The white felt tip is a terrible way to apply but more importantly mine was already opened before i received as the product had already pulled through to the white tip and dried.<br /><br />Gross.<br /><br />I tested the mechanism for getting more to the tip and it really does take some time. I cant comment on the color or blending but the mechanism is clunky, and i would not buy this on amazon. I appreciate amazons return policy, but there are cases where products need to be checked before getting put back in the warehouse.\n",

      "2484->not as good as the trimmer on my Norelco shaver | 2 | 3 | I've had a Norelco 8000 series shaver with a trimmer for awhile.  When I grew a beard, I bought this unit based on the reviews I read here at Amazon.  It's true that because of the vacuum, there is less hair in the sink.  But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver.  If I'd known then what I know now, I would have passed on this item. It may be good for those who don't have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don't want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver).  But for those who have such a shaver, this product is, at best, superfluous.<br /><br />January 29, 2008<br /><br />It's not even a year later, and it has broken already.  I'm not a happy camper.\n",
      "2498->Fun to Use! | 4 | 3 | My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.\n",
      "2505->Not too great | 2 | 3 | Lubricating strip is too oily at first and doesn't last.<br />Blades catch and pull.<br />Shaving head too big, can't follow contours of your face.<br />Refills are too expensive, you are better off with a twin blade disposable.\n",
      "2515->2 coats - lasts about 8 hours | 4 | 3 | This kit was an experiment. I look better in brown eyeliner and mascara, but only could get black magnetic lashes with black liner. (The double magnetic kind are also black). Thought this would be a good thing for me. Well . . . somewhat. The brown is exactly right for me for both the liner and the eyelashes. I used 2 coats (because umpteen places on youtube say to do that and making sure that it's a bit more dense on the inner and outer corners, too). I waited 15 minutes and then stuck the lashes on.<br /><br />Just like all the others---of every ilk---they are too long. The problem, though, with magnetic lashes is that I would need to cut off the very end magnet. This leaves a rather long piece of unsupported lash band which I would then have to glue down. Hmm. And then, the affect only lasts about 8 hours. Might be good for going dancing (not me re COVID) where you get there at 9pm and leave about 2am with some time on either side for arrival and departure.<br /><br />I'll probably still wear these on occasion, but I find that the plain old glue-on lashes work best if I (a) use the dark quick-dry glue and wait 10 seconds or so and (b) put the glue on my lids and then stick the lashes to it. I can wake up with these puppies still on my lids not budged. I don't though.\n",
      "2519->waste of money | 1 | 3 | First of all, this clip is difficult to put in. After I got the elastic securely in place, the silver piece kept breaking off! So I had to keep removing the elastic from my hair & re-attaching the piece to it. Also, as my hair is not very thick, it didn't stay up in place, but kept sagging down & just looking very awkward, so I decided this was not the hair clip for me!<br />I gave up & gave it *and the gold-toned one* to my daughter, whose hair is much thicker than my own.<br />Also, on another note, the clips took forever to arrive; I may as well have shopped elsewhere to begin with!\n",
      "2528->Great gentle facial tool for dogs that don't like having faces washed. May be lightening tear stains too--will update review. | 4 | 3 | This is an interesting way to market a Konjac Sponge, i.e. for your pets. I have to say though, it's pretty brilliant. I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it. I'll update the review if it works well over time though!<br /><br />Please note I most likely purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. In order to save time, I do as much of my shopping online as is humanly possible. I rely heavily on other customers reviews when making purchasing decisions, so as such, I take the honest and unbiased bit very seriously. While I enjoy testing products, I don't hesitate to write a critical review or rate items low when warranted and all opinions and words are my own. If you find the review helpful it would be great if you would click the &#34;yes&#34; button below. Thanks!\n",
      "2531->Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Creamy,  requires very little to use. No actual change to wrinkles. | 4 | 3 | I'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market. They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.\n",
      "2538->its not a ride or die - | 4 | 3 | On the paper, the ZO intense eye cream looks perfect, and it apparently has a host of fans who love it. It's not a great fit for me though. While it seems very well tolerated and doesn't sting, burn or make my eyes water, it doesn't do anything else. Its texture is a bit too thick, which isn't usually the issue with rich/thick eye creams (think Estee Lauder Re-Nutritiv, Sisleya, Shiseido Benefiance), but ZO intense eye cream does tend to ball up on me; to me, it seems like a thick layer that looks almost waxy under the eyes.<br /><br />In general, with cosmetics there are two kinds of results, one comes from a handful of ingredients that actually do something for skin and improve it (usually over weeks/months, like retinol or glycolic acid) and the other type is when a product just makes skin look nicer (with some pigments, polymers and all the other chemical witchery - the stuff that washes off at the end of a day) - this eye product manages neither for me. ZO Intense eye cream claims it helps with the appearance of dark circles and eye puffiness - and I say, nope, the thicker formula does even enhance the appearance of eye bags and every line and wrinkle.\n",
      "2540->Sheds like a German Shepard | 2 | 3 | Updated review - after using for past year plus, it is starting to lose bristles like crazy.  They end up in sink, on my face, in drain (hope it doesn't clog).  I have never had a brush shed like this before so very disappointing.  Otherwise, it is very durable and soft.  I really enjoyed it at first but would think it would last longer.  I have had other brushes last for years.<br /><br />Original Review<br />Super soft with minimal break in.  I let it sit in hot water for about 10 minutes and by the 2nd shave, seemed very well broken in.  I didn't notice any hairs falling out so well constructed.  My old brush lasted several years but wood handle started to &#34;blacken&#34; from water and soften up so hoping that this handle will last a long time.  Nicer quality of hair than my old brush and like the slight rounded shape of bristles.  Very surprised by the quality for the price.\n",

      "2551->Nice value | 5 | 3 | 10-year-old super mega-brand vs. SOGUE:<br /><br />1. The SOGUE operates 10K VBM (vibrations/minute) faster. That's why I choose the SOGUE.<br /><br />2. Generic replacement brushes aren't interchangeable between the two. The SOGUE has a smaller shaft. The brushes are also smaller.<br /><br />3. The SOGUE comes with like a year's supply of brushes, unlike the super mega-brand. They are just a tad softer than I prefer. It took me some years to technically discriminate my preferred bristle adjective (soft, medium, hard) for re-order. My brush changing rule is 'new brush for every recharge' as brushes are now so inexpensive. The charges on these toothbrushes have got to be the longest-lasting rechargeable device in the house. It seems like months go by on a charge.<br /><br />4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference. After a minute of thought, I think smaller is likely better as your teeth and the spaces in between are much smaller than you think. Maybe it's getting in tighter corners.<br /><br />5. The SOGUE charges in like 2 hours vs. overnight for the super mega-brand.<br /><br />I was looking at the super mega-brand's newest models at the big-box store. The price is absurd given all the competition from suppliers like SOGUE. The latest super mega-brand models appear the same size as the SOGUE. At a third of the price and assuming the charge life is long, it's a no-brainer. I'll adapt. Most of the difference between the two is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />SOGUE wins for now. Better than advertised.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click \"Helpful\" so I can know.\n",

I wrote the seller two messages and never got a response, I waited for almost a month the get a reply before I was going to update my review.

      "2563->Great Hydration | 5 | 3 | Sheet masks are my favorite way to give my skin special treatment. You get six masks in this set. Three masks are aloe-based, three have pomegranate extract. Aloe is well known for healing and soothing skin. Pomegranate brightens and plumps. Each mask is soaked in serum. There's enough to cover your neck in what's left in the package. The masks are so juicy that the serum may drip down into your eyes. If you have large eyes, widen the eye holes with your fingers so the top of the hole is at or above your brow. If you refrigerate the masks before application, you'll get the benefit of cooling your skin's temperature and reducing inflammation. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "2566->As expected | 5 | 3 | Kinda pricey but it doesn't turn my nail weird colors like those other brands with whatever toxic chemicals they decide to throw in there.<br />The snuggled up quad has the perfect colors for me. Lasts. a lot longer than other brands. I do a few coats and then it lasts weeks on my toes (pic). For fingers it lasts maybe like 5 days before chipping, but that's pretty good for me.\n",
      "2568->swab stayed on stick, I am happy | 2 | 3 | 5 1 19 UPDATE:  Guess they're dried out?  These fall off the stick EVERY TIME NOW.  Terrible.<br /><br />Glad the swab didn't fall off the stick .  Also use them for applying medicine to foot nails.  My aunt recently had a stroke and still can't use one side of her body a year later.  These are great for dipping into mouthwash then going to town.\n",
      "2589->If you have allergies proceed with caution!!! | 3 | 3 | Three stars, because at first glance the texture was perfect, and the smell was really lovely. Unfortunately (actually fortunately for me and my hair) I glanced at the back label before diving in.<br /><br />Here, the ingredients are listed as olive oil and shea butter...as to be expected. When I checked the back label however I found a ton of natural oils added, including almond oil. I'm very allergic to almonds so I had to return it and cancel the second order I had made.<br /><br />Beware: if you have allergies, ask in the comments what's on the label or proceed with caution. It's kind of sad because it looked so nice. I've made the mistake of using products with almond oil in my hair before as it seems to be in just about everything, the result was SO much itchiness and irritation of my scalp and skin. Even here it seemed I'd done my due diligence, now I know I have to take even more precautions.\n",
      "2593->Defective mascara | 3 | 3 | [[VIDEOID:ca1956804c654bd498d665de11063359]] The serums are tiny samples good for one use. The creams are full size. The cream doesn’t have a nice smell. It kind of smells like cortizone. Overall its nice and came in a gift box. I’m glad I didn’t give it to anyone because the mascara brush was smashed in the tube so its trash.<br />Its an ok box for trying out new products.\n",
      "2598->4 star | 4 | 3 | 4 stars for the amount of brushes this comes with.<br /><br />Deducted one star because of the terrible plastic paint smell and that it's not specified what type of animal hair fibers are used. Still waiting on an answer for that.<br /><br />Received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />As with any makeup brushes make sure you wash them before using to minimize shedding\n",
      "2611->Towels work better | 3 | 3 | I've always just used towels to dry  my dogs paws when they come in from the rain or snow but I thought I'd give this a shot.<br />Im not really impressed. I like the idea behind it, but it doesnt really work all that well and my dog didn't really enjoy sticking her paw in it. My older dog simply looked at me like I was insane and walked away.<br />My vote: 3/5<br />My dogs collective vote: 1.5/5\n",
      "2622->My Skin did NOT like | 3 | 3 | I used Jafra for years and then quit using when my rep retired.  The formulas have been updated.  Almost all of these products broke me out (I'm in my 60's so acne was not ever an issue until I tried this line).<br /><br />I'd recommend buying just one product in the line first to see if it works for you.  I ended up throwing all of it out and it took a month for my skin to clear up.\n",
      "2644->Very nice scent. | 5 | 3 | At first I did not know if I really liked this  Diva Scent For Women, Eau De Parfum, but after a few days of wear it is really starting to grow on me. It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night. The only thing I did not like was that the golden cap was on so tight that I actually pulled off the bottom piece when trying to get the lid off, other than that I really like this perfume. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\n",
      "2645->My New Back Scratcher | 4 | 3 | I don't know anyone who can really reach their back without a special tool, but few roll up like these do.  I like how my complimentary set is so easy to store, either flat or rolled up.<br /><br />Inside the package you find 3 separately sealed scrubber sponges.<br /><br />As someone with sensitive skin I was concerned about them hurting to use but one side is much softer than the other and it really felt great.  This makes a great back scratcher.  I did notice some fraying even from the first use, not much but enough to give me the heads up that these will not last a very long time but maybe 2-3 weeks of daily use each if your careful perhaps longer.\n",
      "2646->Not bad | 4 | 3 | After reading a lot of reviews i decided to go for it.<br />Overall i am happy with it, the only 'cons' are:<br />- have to cover an area a lot of times to get a really smooth shave. A 'quick shave' is simply not an option.<br />- it pulls on longer hairs. Best to use the trimmer first if there are long hairs or you are in for some pain.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- once done, the shave is incredibly smooth<br />- love the trimmer<br />- no burn, the adjustable speed really helps<br />- cleaning is a breeze<br />- battery life and charging speed are great\n",
      "2654->I can safely say that it's an excellent moisturizer. I like the texture of the cream ... | 4 | 3 | I've been using this Neck Firming Cream Anti Aging moisturizer and Anti Aging Body Cream for the past week and although it's too early to review the benefits of long-term use, I can safely say that it's an excellent moisturizer. I like the texture of the cream and the way it absorbs into my skin without leaving any stickiness or scent.<br /><br />I always use moisturizer after washing my face and body that's why my skin is in good condition, apart from under the eye and few lines on my neck. But to keep it that way as I get older, I need to include anti aging products into my daily skin care routine. These two products are packed with natural ingredient like Vitamin E, Avocado, Jojoba, Rosehip, Shea Butter, Coconut oil etc., which are very good for the skin and with continuous use it'll keep the skin young as both of these products are anti aging.  I'm sure with regular use I'll see the results but I have to give time. Over all I'm happy with both the products. When applied, it absorbs well into the skin and leaves my skin very soft and smooth.  Both of these products comes in large 4 oz jar and a little goes a long way. If you're looking for a great moisturizer and neck firming cream without spending too much money, this is a good choice.  Please note I purchased both the products at a discounted price for my honest review.\n",
      "2662->Lightly but lastingly moisturizing | 4 | 3 | (This product was sent to me for review.)<br /><br />This is a nice, light cream for skin that is probably less dry, sun damaged, and aged than mine. My other shea-butter products leave a more lasting &#34;deeply moisturized&#34; feeling on my arms and chest. By contrast, this product (applied twice, a few minutes apart) leave a non-greasy, nice, soft feeling that is more appropriate for day use, especially when I have business engagements or don't want to smear cream on nice clothing.<br /><br />I've had little luck in finding on the Oz Naturals website the precise meaning of the first ingredient, &#34;organic herbal infusion.&#34; A few other consumer websites conclude that the term refers to water in which herbs have been macerated. Given that dry skin needs water, I don't mind that this is the first ingredient (followed by palm oil and sweet almond oil), but I would find more forthcoming to say &#34;organic herbal-infused water.&#34; (Also, what kind of water? Tap water? Filtered water?)<br /><br />Also, the gluten-sensitive folks should note that this product contains wheat germ.\n",
      "2678->Burned | 1 | 3 | This gel burned my face within a minute. I don’t have sensitive skin and I have used all different types of products including peels. This burn is SO HOT, it will likely take a while to heal.<br /><br />I would say shame on me for not patch testing but I’ve never had to with anything. Learned a lesson today.\n",
      "2686->Does not feel like it can straighten hair at the roots but love the low heating temp. | 3 | 3 | I have tried a number of these brushes.  What I like about this one is that it goes down to 80C (176F).  It was so cool that I was not sure it was on.  I have fine hair, high porosity that is 5 months post-straightening relaxer.  And, I find that light heat with a silicone-based glosser helps to gently close the cuticle and to keep my roots from tangling.  What I don’t like is that this brush design does not have the round guiding bristles around the edges that help to pull your hair into the hearing plate.  So, it feels like you are brushing your hair with your elbow and that it is not penetrating to the roots.  You have to grip the hair with your other hand so it feels like you are only getting the shaft of your hair.  So, the brush is best for people with longer hair who do not have curly roots or those who need the super low heat setting as an option.<br /><br />If you would like to be able to rake the brush over your roots to tame curls at 250 F and up, other bushes  to consider are https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FGV9NQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFQGJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  Note - My glamfields brush malfunctioned after first use which is why I ended up trying this one, but I decided to give Glamfields another chance because it is great when it works - never had results like that before.  The BuTure mini is like the Glamfields brush but smaller.  Both feel better (more like a real brushZ) than this one.\n",
      "2687->Cooling and Calming | 5 | 3 | If you live in a dry climate you will especially love this moisturizing, calming mask. It goes on like a gel and cools the skin while it refreshes your complexion. I can't say enough good things about this mask. I have sensitive skin and it calms redness and irritation completely. The truth is you will want to use this every day. I put the mask on at night before bedtime and leave it on for ten minutes. Once washed off my skin is baby soft and plumper. Hours later it still feels like my face is cool and comforted. It especially helped to calm my skin down after I used a serum with retinol in it. So this is something I will want on hand at all times as it is very healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "2690->Really a miracle product. | 4 | 3 | Really a miracle product. Purchased for my 80 year old grandmother who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis in her hands and knees. Says she rubs on in the morning and before bed and that helps with the aching and pain throughout the day. She is sensitive to scents and claims this is light enough but still has a trace of a medicated smell up to about 15 minutes after applying.<br /><br />One negative about this product she has complained about is that it creates tension in her hands after repeated use, like it makes her hands tight? Is anyone else experiencing this? Should she be using less times per day? Other than that, fast shipping and great product!\n",
      "2691->Doesn't feel like metal. Doesn't match curve on body of camera. | 2 | 3 | I'm disappointed in this product.<br /><br />It doesn't feel like metal. It feels like plastic.<br /><br />The curve does not match the curvature of the RX100. There's a very slight gap between body and handgrip. I will admit it is possible that I didn't position it precisely, though I made a great effort to do so.<br /><br />I would have preferred a deeper inset, but that's a stylistic thing.<br /><br />The part on the fron of the camera doesn't run all the way to the lens mount. That leaves a gap between the edge of the handgrip and the lens mount that feels odd to my fingertips when holding the camera.<br /><br />I really don't care for the surprise bonus: the name and model number of the item are printed on the front of the handgrip. That ugly surprise is nowhere to be seen on the nine photos of the product on the Amazon sales page. There is absolutely no practical reason for this to be there.<br /><br />I'm going to try to return. The cheaper plastic version is superior.<br /><br />Jerry\n",
      "2695->This Is not VIRGIN HAIR, ITS COLORED ALREADY!!! | 1 | 3 | The hair is supposed to be VIRGIN BRAZILLIAN DEEP WAVY and it wasn't.  It was DYED DARK BROWN, FELT ROUGH OUT THE PACKAGE AND SMELLED LIKE CHEMICALS.  I WASHED WITH NEUTRALIZING SHAMPOO 6X. THE WATER STILL KEPT COMING UP DARK BROWN. I WASHED IT 2X with a clarifying shampoo to stop the color from coming out.  I made a masque to sit in overnight to soften it up some more. Its drying after rinsing but I'm scared to put in my highlights now BECAUSE it's been colored all ready.<br />This company LIED ABOUT HAVING VIRGIN HAIR ON AMAZON!!! Your not getting what you've PAID FOR,  ITS A LIE!\n",
      "2697->Not great for actual grooming. Good for a comforting brushing. | 3 | 3 | Probably only a good brush for soothing and coddling someone when brushing hair. Not a good tool to use if you want a well groomed head of hair.<br />Bought this for my soft haired Persian. She loves this brush. Still need to use the wire brush for a good brushing. She hates that wire brush.<br />I'm glad I have this brush for her. BUT, it may be causing problems with matting.<br />It is a pretty brush. Very nicely made. I love the color. The blue and beige color way is lovely. That is not a good reason to buy.\n",

      "2707->It is alright. | 2 | 3 | This was kind of so-so for me, It is a beautiful mix of green and black that i was very excited to get, however even pinning up my hair, putting on the wig cap and then this it still did not lay flat, there were bumps and lumps and if you have a small head this will not completely fit. It was large on me an i am still unsure what that tan colored mesh is in the front. it dosnt pin in right with the tiny combs on the sies and they just ad to the lumpyness. The feel of this is soft and they even give you a special brush to brush it. If you can figure out how to wear this and probably straighten it and have a normal sized head (not small) i would say try it, it just did not work for me.<br /><br />Note - I have received this item in exchange for a honest review.\n",
      "2720->Doesn't plump well. | 3 | 3 | I thought this was supposed to be the best lip plumper out there according to lots of reviews, but this lip gloss didn't really plump my lips up that great. ☹<br />It stung but it didn't make my lips look any bigger to be honest. There goes $25 down the drain!\n",
      "2729->Poly nails | 2 | 3 | Was a mess to use. I used a make up brush to spread it and finally got it decent. They should supply a brush made to use with this. Once I got it spread and dried which took 24 hrs a led light didnt work I was able to shape my nails and use my nail wraps with it<br /> 3 nails came off with in 4 days . I removed them all but left a little on the nail and it held. There are no directions on how to use with the product either. I do not recomend it at all.\n",
      "2732->I Love This Product! | 4 | 3 | IG: @ Infiniti.lanez.xix<br /><br />So I was playing around in the spouses hair care products and decided to put this on my South of France haircut..... #LifeChanging. I have 4B/4C hair, I did my daily hair rinse, applied some Cantu leave-in conditioner, then the applied the DNA Castor Oil, and allowed it to sit before picking it out. While picking it out I noticed a big change in the amount (or lack of amount) of hair tangled in the pick. Throughout the day my hair stayed healthy looking, extremely soft, and didn't shrink/draw up. You also don't need a lot, so NO GREASY FOREHEAD.<br /><br />It also has my beard looking healthy and full throughout the entire day. I do the same regimen on my beard as I do on my scalp.\n",
      "2737->Sticky and non-absorbent | 2 | 3 | Application of vitamin C serum to my face twice a day is a routine I carry out without fail. I have tried numerous brands of vitamin C sera (usually combined with Hyaluronic Acid for hydration effects). When this 20% vitamin C serum from Premium Nature was offered as a Lightning Deal, I jumped at a chance to test out yet another brand.<br /><br />An immediate problem I encountered was a shattered glass dropper upon receipt of the item (please see photos), resulting in a potentially dangerous situation. Not to be fazed, I poured the serum into another clean amber glass bottle and commenced using the product.<br /><br />No other vitamin C serum I have tried has been as sticky and gooey as this product. No matter how much or how little of this serum I apply, it remains glistening on the surface of my skin for hours. When I apply sunscreen on top of this serum, the sunscreen too appears not to be absorbed, which I find disturbing.<br /><br />As a child, I used to read cereal boxes to entertain myself during breakfast. Nowadays, my reading material gravitates toward ingredient lists. As a biochemist, a published complete list of ingredients in any biochemical product fascinates me. I wish this serum’s ingredient list were more informative. To that end, I wish the first listed ingredient were not a vague “Organic Herbal infusion”.<br /><br />There are four features I do like about this serum:<br />1) 100% Natural, Cruelty Free, GMO-Free & Paraben Free<br />2) Made and bottled in the USA<br />3) Affordable price<br />4) The clarity of the serum suggests that it has not oxidized into an ineffective product.<br /><br />Despite an intense dislike for the texture of the serum and its non-absorbent characteristics, I religiously applied this product twice a day for the past 3 months. Unfortunately, I have not observed a decrease in the number or depth of the lines on my skin in that time frame.\n",
      "2739->You could get the same results or better with a good pumice stone | 2 | 3 | This item will slightly smooth  rough skin, but does little more.  You could get the same results or better with a good pumice stone. It is battery powered, takes 2 AA, so it does not have a lot of power to it.  I am disappointed and sadly would not recommend this product, it just is not capable of doing what I expected with this product and I don't see it being able to remove any callus.<br />I have received this item at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review and I hope that others find this helpful- I don't think its worth the money.\n",
      "2742->No detailed instructions, suction cups kept sliding down | 2 | 3 | No detailed  instructions.<br /><br />After ridding porcelain bathtub & bathroom tiles of soap, bath gel, etc, I thought it would be easy to apply the suction cups & keep them in place.  It took several tries to find out the most comfortable height to place them.  (I had to re-wet the cups.)<br /><br />When I finally found the perfect height to place them and pushed each \"dimple\" in the front of the pad, representing a suction cup, it felt good...  until all the cups slid downward to an uncomfortable positions.  Because of the lack of Q & A on this website item, I didn't know what I was doing wrong.  Very frustrating!<br /><br />I\"ll try again tomorrow, but won't waste another 45 mins.  If it keeps sliding, I'll return it.<br /><br />- how wet to make the suction cups<br />- how to prevent suction cups from sliding down after ridding porcelain bathtub & bathroom tiles of soap, bath gel, etc<br />-<br /><br />suction cups kept sliding down\n",
      "2745->Strawberry was a mistake | 2 | 3 | I think they're fun to chew, but the taste is awful. Idk why I thought strawberry would be a good flavor, it's not. At this point, I'd rather chew on plain stick flavor haha.<br />I don't recommend strawberry at all.\n",
      "2779->Great brush, works well, substantial size,  loaded with  bristles | 5 | 3 | I purchased for my daughter,24, who loves to contour and have fun with her make-up. She also enjoys trying low end and high end products and tools looking for a good price but more important to her is that they work. When I saw this online and read the reviews I bought as a gift. Last year I gave her an expensive contour kit , which she uses daily, so she tried this flat contour brush with that palette. She said it works great for contouring cheeks, forehead and neck area and the brush holds the product well. After feeling the brush for myself- it is extremely soft and filled with short bristles- and seeing the results on her skin I ordered 3 more. One for my daughter in law, myself and an extra in case I need to give a gift!<br />While looking on Amazon and comparing products, prices and reviews, I noticed many of the same brushes, this one, with different prices- some were 5.99, some were 1.99 + 3.98 shipping... so be aware for higher prices for same product.\n",
      "2783->looks cheaply made, but works, and has lasted 1 year so far | 4 | 3 | I have been using Easy-Feet for a couple of weeks.  The suction cups don't stick to the bottom of my shower, but that is because my shower floor has a textured plastic surface.  Easy-Feet lets you scrub the top and bottom of your feet at the same time.  I like the functionality.  Easy-Feet seems cheap, the bristles seem cheap, the plastic body seems cheap, I would guess I wont get more than a few months out of this product.  I saw a similar product on Amazon for about double the price, with better reviews.  I will buy this when the Easy-Feet wears out.<br /><br />Update: I have had this unit for 1 year, using it daily.  The brissles show a little wear, there is some dark staining at the bristle bases. Still work well though.\n",
      "2789->Definitely makes a difference! | 5 | 3 | Score! Finally found something that makes my skin glow and look smoother than ever.<br />I put this on every day before anything else and I truly have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. As we get older, I know in my case at least, skin becomes more dull. This helps to brighten and I really feel like it has made a difference.<br />Now I know I can spend 100 - 200 bucks at any department store makeup counter  and get didn't care products that make a difference and work. But why pay those prices when I can come to Amazon and get something less expensive that works just as well, if not better?<br /> I am less into name brands and more into results. And this helped produce results. As a bonus,<br />I even got to buy this hyaluronic acid at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",

Absolutely no negatives about the supplier or description.<br /><br />Meh: neither side is aggressive enough for what I wanted (hard scrubbing), will try one of the long-handled brushes next... just personal preference.<br /><br />.\n",
      "2803->Good cleanser, but too watery | 3 | 3 | I have combination skin (with oily T-zone area) and live in a hot, humid climate. I like my pores to be deeply cleansed but not to the extent that my skin gets dry and tight after a wash.<br /><br />This cleanser does a good job of cleaning and has no harmful/harsh chemicals, but it doesn't give me the totally clean, exfoliated yet 'just-right' feeling that my Dr. Alkatis cleanser does.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because it's too watery or because it has essential oils or something like that.<br /><br />For the price, the bottle is also a tad small.<br /><br />Conclusion: I will reserve it for the days when my skin is really dehydrated and I only require a mild cleansing.\n",
      "2806->Great Trimmer, Leaves your Bathroom Clean and Works just Right | 4 | 3 | As usual great service when buying directly from Amazon.<br /><br />This review is mostly a comparison to old trimmers I have used such as one that charges on a base and one that runs off 2 AA batteries.<br /><br />Positives<br />1. The charger is just a cable that plugs into the bottom. I personally hate bases as I have drawers and other storage and this allows me to pull it out real quick to charge the couple of hours it needs and then I just bundle it up and put it away.<br />2. The Battery lasts a long time, even with the vacuum this thing just keeps going. Should easily last me a month as I have goatee and mustache versus a full beard.<br />3. The vacuum does a good job and picks up most hairs so there is minimal cleanup. Usually I just blow on the head to get rid of loose hairs so they don't end up in my drawer.<br />4. The size adjustment is quick and doesn't require separate attachments.<br />5. It gives you a great look, it gives a nice even cut and I will be using this for a few years.<br /><br />Negatives<br />1. If your trimmer batteries are dead it still won't run even when plugged in. The trimmer turns off the charging port when you press the on button. The more expensive model allows this so it's just a up sell not a technical limitation.<br />2. This device is huge compared to most other trimmers I have tried. For the most part this isn't too bad but it's sort of difficult to trim my mustache under my nose but with a little practice it isn't hard.<br />3. It can get clogged when doing longer hair as the vacuum is smaller so either cut long hair in two steps or just keep cutting because it still cuts just fine even when the vacuum is clogged..<br /><br />Overall I compared this to the higher end model that has the smaller trimmer attachment and I would say get this plus a tiny Remington trimmer as I feel these are too fat for delicate work.<br /><br />UPDATE: I purchased this item June 2009 and gave it a full charge. I trim my mustache and goatee regularly with this and I have not charged it since new and it performs perfectly. In regards to durability, everything works fine and I have no issues with it.<br />UPDATE (6/15/10): Working like new, I've only charged it like 3 times and I am a hairy guy. Trimming goatee, mustache, and keeping that scruffy look without issues.\n",
      "2807->Tangles!!! Terrible hair!!! | 1 | 3 | I usually don’t write reviews but this hair is SO bad I felt obligated to warn others! I take really good care of my weaves with conditioning, wrapping every night etc I usually get 3 months out of them. This one is barely lasting a month and I keep getting so many disgustingly huge knots and tangles.<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Save yourself the headache and do not buy this hair.\n",
      "2814->LOVE! super gentle manual exfoliation & chemical peeling product; deep cleans pores; brightens | 5 | 3 | I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted \"sheet mask\". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far.

      "2818->Such a great device! Husband needed this for a chest cold and it's been very helpful. | 4 | 3 | So far so good. I cleaned the plastic water holder with soap/water before using since it had a strong plastic-chemical smell. Then I rinsed the opening where the water container attaches -- and then ran it for 2 minutes without breathing the vapors.  After the 2 minutes it smelled fine.<br />My husband had been using a pot of water on the stove to breath steam for his stubborn chest cold -- and it was too awkward. This device makes it super easy for him to do treatments in under 1 minute.\n",
      "2824->Great Product, Poor Color Range | 3 | 3 | As a pale girl in the winter, I always know with any foundation or other tinted skin product there is always a strong chance it will be too dark for me, and this unfortunately was no different.  I do not want that to completely skew my review because I do think this is a good product for those who this will match and I hope to use it over the summer.<br />Starting with the packaging, this comes in a large box because it actually comes with a second cushion to replace when your first one is empty, the compact itself it smaller. When you open it there is a mirror, and a plastic covering to protect your cushion and store your sponge, I really like this because it keeps the cushion from drying out and rubbing on your sponge wasting product when you aren't using it.<br />The product itself goes on really well, it feels lighter and more silky than a liquid foundation. It provides medium coverage and doesn't feel cakey or thick.  The applicator sponge has one side to apply the product and the other side has a ribbon on the back that you can use to hold it without having to touch your fingers on the front.<br />I ordered the color 104 which was listed as medium/light pink (it is the second to lightest color.)  The stock photos online made it look like it could be a decent match for my skin.  I am aware that stock photos aren't always super accurate but I will say that this turned out MUCH darker and more yellow than pink in person.  The last photo in my review is the stock photo above with the actual photo of the product I received below.  It doesn't go on that dark when applied to skin as you can see in the second to last photo but it is still much darker and more orange/yellow toned than I expected.<br />Overall I think if this matches your skin it is a great product but for anyone who is pale I can't recommend.\n",
      "2837->Worked for me...but why is there no tampering seal? | 4 | 3 | Very pleased with the results after one month.  My facial acid scars have lightened as well as softened my complexion.  Altogether with a notieable an also decrease of pore size,  I use less foundation and concealer.  I can now apply day and evening moisturizer with ease.<br /><br />I don't mind the look, scent and consistency of the product.  It looks like mashed cooked yams and smells like butternut squash...lol  But, surprisingly, it works into the skin fast with little residue.  I can feel a slight tingle when I apply the cream after Derma Rolling.<br /><br />My only issue I have is that there is no tampering seal.  It arrived in the jar that is pictured,  individually  boxed with no inserted directions.  As soon as the jar is open, you immediately see the contents along with  some spillage on the lid due to the absence of a sealer :(\n",
      "2839->I am NOT satisfied with this purchase | 3 | 3 | I am NOT satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />The tube wasn't even half full and the product smelled old. I contacted the seller and was informed that was the proper amount for the tube, but the odor was not even mentioned.<br /><br />I have purchased several Alpha Hydroxy products and they have always been mostly unscented and the tubes were at least 3/4+ full. I currently use their eye cream which is in a tube and after a month of daily use it's still at least 3/4 full.<br /><br />I have no idea if the product normally smells bad, but I seriously doubt it because other reviews would have mentioned it.<br /><br />I was looking forward to using this product, but refuse to put something that I'm pretty sure was previously opened and used on my face. I will locate a different seller and try to purchase again since it reviews well.<br /><br />I will not be buying anything from Beauty Drive again. Their customer service was non-existent.\n",
      "2857->Just like the 90's | 4 | 3 | Smells just like the stuff I wore in high school in the 90s and bright back nostalgic memories.<br />Some cons: scent doesn't last long it lasted about 2 hrs<br />Needs a tad more nag champa<br />But the powder of the champa is more prevalent when the power of patchouli wears down.<br />Overall I love it, a little pricey though, the $8-10 range would be better.\n",
      "2868->differnt from the original MakeUp Eraser | 3 | 3 | I'm puzzled. The box said \"Costco\" on it and had both French and English written on it.  It seems like a a version that would be sold in Europe. Even tho these are called \"Original Makeup Eraser\" (the brand name) they seem to be a dupe (tho not at dupe prices). There is not a band for your hand across the small ones.  There are supposed to be different textures on each side--one for cleaning: one for exfoliating. BOTH sides are the same (no exfoliating side). In reading reviews it's clear customers got different versions of this.  I got my first wipes  from a distributor in US. Another version of what looks like the same 9 pc set is sold on Amazon for 2x the price. The description for that one says:<br />\"The Original MakeUp Eraser is a premium, patented, polyester cloth made up of millions of tiny hair-like fibers that work together to create a \"suction\" for all dirt, makeup, & oil in your pores. Double-sided to erase makeup with the short fibers side & exfoliate the skin with the long fiber side (side with tag).

No matter what the name. Deceptive.\n",
      "2877->Big and festive! | 4 | 2 | This headband is actually a clip on bow attached to the headband which I like because eventually when my daughter gets more hair she can wear the bow in her hair without the headband. I think for Christmas this bow is perfect and very festive. I will say that the bow is pretty big, a little bigger than I expected but it is still cute. The head band fits on my 3 month old just fine!<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please let me know! Thank you!\n",
      "2881->It looks nothing like the picture... :( | 1 | 2 | I've never actually bought hair from Amazon; however, it looked like it would be good, especially since it stated it would be somewhat natural.  Deep down, in my experiences with crochet hair, it wasn't going to be natural, but I hoped that it would. After getting my stylist to crochet in this hair, my immediate reaction was \"this is awful\", but I thought it would grow on me.  After a few days of my husband not looking at me, and my best friend telling me that I looked like a poodle, I started wearing my hats again.  This week, I have another hair appointment to have it removed and replaced with something more my style.  The hair is just hard and wild!  There is no amount of calming it down.  The more I tried to give it shape, the more tangled and hard it became.  I have cried more than I need to.  I hate that I made this purchase and now it is costing me more to get a new style.  I will never buy from this company again!  By the way, I buy hair because of male patterned baldness, so I already have a sensitivity to how my hair looks and this just made having a bad hair day, this made it even worse.<br />Purchase with caution, because it looks nothing like the picture!\n",
      "2888->Effective, but use sparingly | 4 | 2 | This oil is effective for taming the random parts of the beard that are going in some odd direction on any given day.  It also seems to be making the beard less dry and bristly.  You probably wouldn't need it on a trim beard, but those of us with manly beard start needing a little something at some point.<br /><br />Like any oil, it can be annoying if you absent-mindedly stroke your beard and then touch your face with your hands.  It does not irritate the eyes, so that is good, but you have to remember to go easy on the oil and pretty much keep your hands off your beard.<br /><br />Modern Barbarian's beard balm is a better product for daily use in that it doesn't make your face and hands oily.  The balm really does the job with no downside.  This oil does a better job re:  getting the beard ready to be combed into a presentable shape, but comes with the down side of being oily.  I use the oil if I need to look presentable for something important, but I rub a little of the balm in every day.\n",
      "2889->UPDATE: Broke minimal light useage | 1 | 2 | Rocks when blow drying hair. For my novice purposes it is good. Adjustable like nobody's business! Love that. Light weight and carry bag. Wish (web site) has them cheaper even with shipping; however, extended shipping time.<br />**UPDATE Just decreased this to one star. Was brushing out a wig and the plastic neck broke. Cracked completely where the screw attaches the blue piece to the stand. This crack is unacceptable for less than 35 days of ownership perhaps 5 times-light useage. I have gorilla glue duct tape on it but have to extensively support the area. Will be asking for a refund even though pass my 30 days.\n",
      "2894->Poor quality -- Product ran down my brow to eyes and cheek! | 1 | 2 | In my opinion, this product is of very poor quality. It was dark and runny. I had thought that once it dried all would be fine and went about my merry way only to later catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror at the office --OMG! I saw dark runny &#34;Blissful Brows&#34; by Hairgenics had streamed down my brows to my eyes and on down my cheek!<br />[[ASIN:B072JX8LV5 Blissful Brows by Hairgenics - One Step Long Lasting Tinted Eyebrow Gel Infused with Fibers for Thick and Full Brows (Brunette)]]\n",
      "2897->Quality product, wonderful for scalp and hair | 5 | 2 | This comb is life-changing! The brushes we choose can be the difference between major breakage and healthy hair. I guess I always thought I needed a big paddle brush to get the job done! Not the case. This brush is beautiful and takes good care of my hair.<br />Sandalwood helps to gently smooth scalp's natural oils into hair, increasing shine without the static of ordinary plastic brushes.<br />After I began using this comb instead of my plastic paddle brush I immediately realized how much I'd been breaking my hair before! It just isn't necessary. I now comb my hair with this comb and end up with smooth, combed hair that hasn't been &#34;ripped&#34; through with a brush.<br />I still use a round brush for blowdrying (with heat protection!) but I've been using this comb for day-to-day use for months now and I won't be going back.\n",

      "2903->Good idea, bad implementation. | 3 | 2 | As a woman in my 40's, chest wrinkles are a concern.  I bought this thinking it was such a great idea.  It arrived fast, and there are 2 reusable silicone pads in individual sealed foil packages.  I'm not sure if I do calisthenics in my sleep, just have too oily of skin, or if the pad Just doesn't stay on.  Even when I apply after showering and no lotion or powder on, I wake up with it stuck to my shoulder or thigh.  Some days the hunt for where it wound up is funnier than others.<br />For me, I would not purchase this again.\n",

      "2929->Beautiful array of colors but quality is inconsistent | 3 | 2 | These pencils are a beautiful array of colors with most being of decent quality with a smooth gliding, gel makeup pencil consistency, exceptional pigments, and waterproof. But, several of the pencils are unfortunately not of the same quality.<br />I honestly do not know if they lower quality, older, or just made differently but they do not glide as easily and the lead broke off deep inside the barrels leaving a large amount of the makeup stick that cannot be fused back into the remaining amount inside the barrel.<br /><br />I'd like to mention that the sticks were not far outside the barrels when breakage happened. Anyone that uses makeup inside self sharpening barrels knows you do not roll the product up very far from the opening otherwise you will experience breakage since the pencil width is thinner with less stability unlike a makeup pencil you sharpen.<br />It seems like this could have been prevented had the makeup pencil lead been more flush inside the barrel.<br /><br />Thankfully I've dealt with issues like this multiple times throughout my years wearing makeup so I know how to salvage the loosened pencil lead and not entirely loose out.\n",

      "2936->So dissapointed. | 1 | 2 | I have been dying my hair for such a long time and am always excited to find a differnt product to try and get long lasting vibrant color.<br /><br />I was excited to see that this brand was part of Manic Panic, usually their product lasts a decent amount of time 10-40 washes that I'm happy with. Unfortunately this didn't last even a week without leaving horrible streaks of where you could practically see the bleached blonde fading through.<br /><br />After two weeks my hair was such an uneven pale violet that I was able to just throw on some of Punky Colour's bright reds and my result was hot pink. Very sad and I cannot believe that they would try to pass off such a formula as \"amplified\". the common Manic Panic lasts much longer.\n",
      "2949->There's good news & bad news.... | 4 | 2 | I looked again at the photo of the product and had to laugh because I think they may have cut it a bit to fit correctly?  The product is fine, it does what I want.  BUT I do need to take scissors and snip the outer edge of eye openings and the edges of the mouth opening (which is WAY smaller than my very average mouth) The first time I used it &#34;as is&#34; it felt slightly claustrophobic because the eye and mouth spaces just aren't quite right.  Forehead to chin length is fine, the width falls slightly short for my face (again v average size face!)  I dampen the mask before use, so it doesn't suck up all the product I put on my face, and that seems to work well.<br />So it gets 4 stars bc the product does what I need and it is impossible to make a size that fits everyone?  I would say that the pre-treated face masks I've bought fit me much better and I looked high and low to buy those plain, but couldn't find them.  Oh, and I bought these myself and got NO DISCOUNT or any freebie for doing so!\n",

      "2969->Excellent disposable wax treatment | 5 | 2 | This is an excellent portable paraffin wax treatment. I really love how it makes my hands feel really silky and smooth. I can't really do anything when these are on my hands, but they feel nice and I like relaxing with them. Also, the black heart on the outside actually turns red when the wax gets really hot. I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands. It also stays hot for a pretty long time, which surprised me that all the heat didn't dissipate really quickly.<br /><br />These are made for average hands, so if your hands are giant, then these might be hard to fit into. But, they should work pretty well for most hands. Also, they're great for the first treatment, but for subsequent treatments, it's really tough to keep the wax in the sleeve while microwaving.<br /><br />But, overall, they're awesome for disposable paraffin treatments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Makes your hands feel silky smooth<br />+The spongy interior absorbs and holds most of the wax<br />+The heat indicator really works<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May not last a full five treatments<br /><br />*TGN gave me this wax to review*\n",

When you squeeze down, only a tiny bit of cream comes out.<br />I suspect I have a defective bottle.<br />The product itself is lovely.  Light and smooth and does brighten my skin.  But it took me age to actually get it out of the bottle....  May have to return it.\n",
      "2992->Somewhat good in theory, not so great in reality. 2.5 Stars ✨ | 3 | 2 | This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.\n",
      "3008->Decent set of brushes for the price. Many to choose from | 4 | 2 | This is a great day of brushes for the price. There are so many brushes in this set-one for every kind of makeup that I use. I love the fan brushes-they are perfect for highlighter and bronzer. The eyeliner brushes are good-they're not the best that I've used, but also not the worst.<br />The set comes with a nice, fold out case to store them in and you can spread the case out in order to see all the brushes and pick out the one that you want to use. There is a smell to them when they first arrive, but the smell quickly dissipates after I aired them out. None of the bristles have been shedding on the brushes which is great. Some of the bristles are longer on a couple of the brushes, but I trimmed them and they're good to go. I have been using them for a couple is weeks now and haven't had a problem, but I will post updates on durability with continued use. Great set!\n",

      "3012->unwieldy upgrade | 2 | 2 | For years I owned a previous model, the Norelco T860. In fact, I still own it and it works just fine (although it now only holds a charge for about a week). I needed another trimmer for another location, and this one was the upgrade that was available. What a disappointment.<br /><br />For one thing, it's really big. While the T860 was like a small South American banana, the T780 is like a big North American cucumber. Imagine trying to create an intricate drawing with a child's crayola instead of a pencil.<br /><br />The extra size is apparently needed for the internal vacuum. This vacuum \"works\" in that it doesn't let hairs fall to the sink. But they become forever clogged inside the apparatus; you're never going to get them cleaned out, even after opening the flimsy plastic cover. The vacuum also adds to the noise. And my razor doesn't have a vacuum, so I'm going to have to clean up hairs anyway.<br /><br />The extra girth and the vacuum outlet near the blades means that, as much as I try to cram the thing up under my nose, the blades can't reach the hairs at the top of my upper lip. I have to resort to using the (non-vacuuming) trimmer on my razor, or I'll have two or three long, uncut hairs just under my nose. And the retractable vacuum cover near the blades obscures the view and turns an agile row of blades into an unwieldy block of plastic.<br /><br />The only benefit of this model is that the battery works well and it uses a nice color scheme.<br /><br />I wish I knew where to buy another Norelco T860.<br /><br />Update 2010-09-20: It turns out that the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philps Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is apparently the upgrade to the Norelco T860, renamed to a \"stubble trimmer\". Its form is seemingly identical to the T860 and, besides the black/red color and the more grippable rubber coating on the handle, the only major changes seems to be a welcome battery upgrade from a NiCad to a NiMH. The QT4021 is just what I was looking for. I guess I'll drop off the T780 at my parents' house to use as a backup.\n",

      "3047->meh... time to buy a professional grade lamp | 2 | 2 | this has one of the highest wattages of all LED nail lamps so i figure it’ll work better than the 12v i already have. plus, the ones the salons use are too pricey and have less voltage. long story short, it seems to cure well, hardening the polish better than my 12v lamp. i’m really rough on my hands due to laundry, dishes, and constant hand washing so only time will tell. my only complaint so far is the bottom is really loose that it comes off easily. i was moving it from the counter to the table and the bottom fell right off.<br /><br />UPDATE - it’s only been 3 days since i did my nails and they’re already starting to bubble. some have already started peeling. updated my review from 4 stars to 2. i wore gloves during dish washing so i hope the heat trapped inside the gloves wasn’t the cause. i always apply thin layers and cap the free edges so my technique is solid. i’m going to bite the bullet and spend the money on a professional lamp.\n",

      "3066->My face feels amazing when I use this! | 5 | 2 | This facial serum by Dr. Denese is one of the best serums I have used in some time. It comes in a stunning looking dropper bottle. Sadly it does not have a scent but I will look past that. It is also not a cheap serum to be honest but I think this one is worth it.<br /><br />The serum has an oil like consistency and is clear. With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very lightweight and it absorbs very quickly into your face and just literally disappears into your skin. It leaves absolutely no residue behind which is odd because it has a real oil like consistency so I expected an oily residue on my skin. Instead I was left with super soft and smooth skin that just felt and looked fantastic. And that is why I just really like this so much.\n",

      "3079->Already Seems to be Working | 3 | 2 | Last Update:<br />2/19/18<br />Well, I used this whole bottle in about 3 weeks but to be fair, I was using it like 3x a day :-) I popped this back to 3 stars just because I don't think it did much for me. While the ingredients are natural - I am not feeling much of a change in my skin.  I do think it helped a little. But my skin was already nice to begin with (I struggle more with sagging then lines anyway).  Still? Considering how natural, easy to apply and how great it smells - it deserves 3 stars.<br /><br />Update:<br />2 weeks into using and while I still like this serum, I haven't noticed that much of a diffrence in my skin. Maybe it needs more time.  I will keep it at 4 stars because it does not irritate my skin, smells lovely and it is reasonably priced. I am almost done with the bottle - ha, maybe one week left if that - but to be fair I put it on 2X a day, in the AM and at night before bed.  I will be ordering another cream and review and compare.<br /><br />I've only had this serum for about a week but I already feel like it's making my skin glow a bit more.  I took some pictures today and this is with the serum on, including around my eyes as well as with my daily cream mixed with a very small amount of neutral foundation.  I have not noticed any irritation around my eyes when putting it on or anywhere else on my face - not sure why some reviewers say this makes them break out - I have not had that expereince.<br /><br />I do notice that I need to put moisturizer on after I put this serum on otherwise, my face feels stiff and constricted. I wait for five minutes and then apply my moisture/light foundation.  The serum has very little smell and the color is like vanilla and yes it is creamy and supposed to be.  I'm leaving it at four stars until I review it again after another week. The company says, if after two weeks you do not like the affect you can return it.  I'm also leaving it at four stars because I wish it was bigger - the size of the bottle is small, see pics.<br /><br />Overall though? I really like this serum and feel like I'm treating myself to something special when I put it on.  I'm nearing 50 and while I am working on embracing aging gracefully and even with some positivity - I still want to look as healthy as possible.  Note, I will not say &#34;look as youthful&#34; as possible because why do we always have to equate youth with beauty? Why not strive to look healthy and happy at any age and have that be beautiful as well?\n",
      "3085->Not what you think | 3 | 2 | Its not 20 inches. More like 17. And its DARK AUBURN not Auburn<br />Its not worth the walk or time to return it. Ill just go back to ebay FREE SHIPPING. Usually i always get exactly what i order on Ebay. And i know before hand where its shipped from.\n",
      "3095->Great scent. Poor longevity of lips feeling moisturized | 3 | 2 | I wanted to love it so so much. And I’ll still use it.<br /> 1) not very pocket friendly. 2)I do love the smell! 3) I find myself reapplying way more than with others.  I feel it dries my lips out real quick.\n",
      "3114->Reviews pulled me in..... | 3 | 2 | Beautiful ✅✔️<br />Quality/Longevity ❌✖️<br /><br />I was in MX for 2 weeks swimming daily and washing this hair immediately afterwards with a cleansing conditioner (finishing with a little argan oil) and at first it seemed fine but by the 8th day, the texture went from soft and manageable to stiff and unruly. A week after returning home, I removed the hair and tossed it in the trash so total time I wore this hair was only 4 weeks which was very disappointing.<br /><br />Was wash frequency a factor? IDK but why would it be for good quality hair!?! My own hair length is mid-back and very thick so there is NO WAY I can have all this hair braided under a sew-in without washing it weekly/often so if that's a contributing factor then this isn't the hair for me.<br /><br />I'm including a few pics one of which captures the craziness around day 8/9 pretty good.\n",
      "3115->Fabulous Product/Especially W/ Chemo Hair Changes | 5 | 2 | I have tons of other brands & products in<br />my linen closet/toiletries closet, but this is all I use now; been fighting terminal cancer for eight years as of 1/2023 (had hair/didn’t have hair/had completely different texture & color afterward several different types of hair, back to kind of smooth hair???). My hair has repeatedly changed during my many medications & various treatments & a bone marrow transplant. My college senior daughter♥️ (Let’s Go Mountaineeeeeers!💙💛💙) found this, loved it, & brought some home for me. I was skeptical because of the ridiculous price. However, I tried it & have used nothing else since. I’ve purchased it repeatedly. If you have fine or thinning hair, this may not be for you as it might weight it down? My hair has always been thick, but straight & soft & medium brown with highlights (W/F). Not now. It grew back a different color, totally different VERY coarse texture, dry, super dark & unruly, some very wiry gray, not to mention frizzy-curly like Bozo the Clown. Not pretty curls. Fuzzy, wiry uncontrollable uneven tight curls. It was terrible looking, but the least of my worries. I wore it proudly through my hair stages…completely bald, “prickly just starting to grow” hair about a millimeter long, “mange dog patches” of baldness hair combined with clumps of downy soft hair, &, of course, my Bozo uneven curls. This is the only thing that keeps it soft, but doesn’t leave it feeling dry OR greasy (like that ‘not rinsed out all of the way’ feeling). Yes, it’s absurdly expensive, but I will keep buying it because it hydrates great & smells nice. I will get my joy wherever I can find it these days because life’s too short not to! My daughter is awesome & I thank her for finding this!!! (PS: This was the shampoo/conditioner small combo pack).\n",
      "3119->I like it. Free file is nice.... | 5 | 2 | This is amazing! Mine did not arrive damaged, so that was a plus! The colors are pretty aimilar to the picture- however the first one is more gold than the pictured silver. It came with a washable nail file..its pretty nice!<br />No intructions, but I cured it 30 seconds...worked well. I used a no wip base and top coat from amazon, worked well too.<br />Per the previous reviews- they are Indeed numbered, so you can't tell what it what- I made little stickers to help me, was easy enough.<br />I'd buy more of of this brand as the price is good for 6 bottles-theyre small bottles, but it last long and I paint thin coats so I don't need as much as normal polish.\n",
      "3121->The blue does show up on my blonde lashes, but I had issues applying it evenly | 3 | 2 | This review is for the &#34;Lash Splash&#34; (blue) variety.<br /><br />I have blond lashes, and the bright blue is very apparent on my lashes. It could be a fun color for someone, but as a middle-aged woman it's really not me.  I am not taking off any stars for that... it might be exactly what someone else wants.  (I had selected this product hoping it might be a good replacement for the discontinued Cover Girl Exact Eyelights in sapphire that I've been using for years. It's not the same color at all. The Cover Girl product is a soft blue-black; the SinfulColors is a bright blue.)<br /><br />Because this color is so different from my natural lash color, I really have to be careful to coat the entire lash from base to tip to get an even look.  But this mascara gets kind of clumpy when applying a second or third coat, so it's really difficult to get that even coverage.  I needed to touch it up after a couple of hours, and had the clumpiness issue again.\n",
      "3126->Very wet, with an unusual brush | 3 | 2 | I had heard a lot of buzz about this mascara and ran out and bought it, even though I've never had much luck with L'Oreal mascaras. My unlucky streak continues.<br /><br />The brush is, triangular shaped with the plastic bristles on one side. I think the brush shape does spread the lashes for the much desired &#34;butterfly&#34; shape. However, other qualities were not so successful.<br /><br />This masacara  is very, very wet and blobs when you apply it. The way the brush is shaped makes it hold a lot of mascara. I have long-but-light lashes and I curled them before applying. I had to comb the (using little lash comb) to separate them and unstick them. Once separated I noticed a slight fan effect, but not noticeably different from when I use my favorite Maybelline  Full n Soft, which is a much dryer formula with a more traditional brush. Unlike previous L'Oreal mascaras it did stay on all day with no flaking.<br /><br />So I gave it 3 stars for being waterproof and the unusual brush which may work better on different types of lashes. However I took off stars for its messy wet application. It was also a bit difficult to remove.<br /><br />If you like a wet mascara, you'll probably like this one. However, I did not and won't buy again.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It is waterproof.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Difficult and blobby application<br />Sticks lashes together\n",
      "3131->Coolest. Thinnest. Most Stretchable! | 4 | 2 | These are the most stretchable & comfortable. My head size is larger & my hair thick, so these are almost the best. They are also thinner & cooler.<br />However,  the fabric color looks much lighter when stretched & the buttons are a little smaller than I prefer. But what I took 1 star off for was the fact that the buttons are too far back on the band, which makes the mask way too tight on my face. Also, if you have a small, petite head with flat hair, you might find that these do not stay in place like 1 reviewer stated.<br />I have many 1 inch bright colored buttons which I have sewn on other headbands,  so I will try to sew some about 2 inches forward on these. The problem with the thicker cotton ones are that they are too small, tight, uncomfortable & do not stretch as much, feeling like your head is in a vice. Not this one.\n",
      "3132->I wish it worked for me | 4 | 2 | I really, really wish this set had worked for my dryer. But it wasnt the manafucaturers fault so i cant give it a bad rating. My drer is just a more expensive, small niche dryer \"j'bere\"; nothing really fits it.<br /><br />But i believe it could work for more common dryers. It had the biggest \"bowl\" of the three diffusers i purchased and the plastic felt stronger and of better quality. I really liked the attachments because they seemed to provide a better attachment than other diffusers. Unfortanetly, none of them attached to my dryer so i had to return.\n",
      "3140->One star is because the item is prodigious in size ... | 1 | 2 | One star is because the item is prodigious in size!!! The description should have the words large, prolific, prodigious and really big awkward looking tool.<br />Yuk!!!\n",
      "3141->Vegetal, messy flower balls; not sure why anyone would use this for anything but tea | 2 | 2 | I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.\n",
      "3142->non greasy, high moisture, makes skin soft, supple, comfortable feeling | 5 | 2 | My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive*, clear but with redness/visible veins (rosacea).<br /><br />My skin has been really loving this Easydew Daily Double Hydra moisturizer. I love K-beauty products and hadn't heard of this line. I am glad to have been able to try it as it just works really well for me. I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference. Seems to play well with other products (SPF, serums, masks)<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077BTR9H4/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp<br /><br />As someone who engages in hobby skin care, I like finding through trial and error items that I would buy again, or would be my go-to if I had to choose just a couple things. These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "3143->While they do add support/lift, they do not fit 25% of my post earrings and are awkward to use | 3 | 2 | I tried these with 20 of my post earrings and they fit 15 pair. For the ones that didn't work, I couldn't get the post through the backing hole - it was just too small and the common factor for those is that those posts have &#34;ridges&#34; (which I have always thought were intended to provide a tighter, more secure fit into the backing).<br /><br />While these backings do provide some lift, I found them somewhat awkward to use/put on, both because they are considerably larger than typical backing and the need to ensure the heart is facing up.<br /><br />3 stars, because they do work with some earrings and they do provide lift. 2 stars off because they do not fit all of my post style earrings and they are awkward to put on.\n",
      "3144->For high density hair | 3 | 2 | This brush is all the rage in the natural hair community. However, I found it it is more suitable for those with thick hair or those with slightly loose end curls. It is definitely a large paddle brush. Because of this, it is very difficult to get full usage out of it if you have a smaller head or low-density hair. It was advertised as appropriate for all hair types, but that is not the case. It would be great if they made it in smaller sizes as well.<br /> That being said, I would recommend this for people with a lot of hair on their head that have troubled detangling.\n",
      "3153->Way better than Sally Hansen | 4 | 2 | Way better than Sally Hansen.<br />I use pure acetone and a small makeup brush to make my lines, so I don't use the stickers that it comes with.<br />But as far as the white and the pink goes, it's good. It's not streaky or sticky and the pink does not make the white turn color unlike Sally Hansen.<br />For only $5, you can't beat it.\n",
      "3159->Helps My Sensitive Skin | 4 | 2 | My skin is ridiculously sensitive, so finding products that won't set off some kind of irritation, breakouts, etc., is nearly impossible. I hadn't used a cica cream before, but the reviews were positive enough that I wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />The texture is interesting - it's less a cream and more like a gel that's almost runny. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin and doesn't leave behind any kind of greasy residue. It does help with redness and dry patches, and at this point, it doesn't seem to cause breakouts.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that I was hoping for longer-lasting, even cumulative results, because I apply this at night and right after I rinse my face off the next morning, it's almost like I never used the product at all. Maybe it's a matter of me having to use this twice a day (at least), but given the high price point for what is, in fact, a pretty small tube of product, I feel like I would go through the cream much too quickly that way.<br /><br />Still, it does help a bit and doesn't seem to cause any issues, so this is one of the very few products that I can see myself continuing to use long-term.\n",
      "3160->Effective Lotion for Intense Skin Needs | 4 | 2 | There is much to appreciate about this Zeroid Intensive Lotion for Severe Dry & Disordered Skin. This is a Korean-made product and I do tend to be a fan of most Korean skin care products.<br /><br />This arrives in a 6.76 ounce bottle. It was nicely sealed. I was modestly concerned about the product's clearly labeled manufacturing date 3/11/2020 indicating I'm receiving it over 16 months after the manufacturing date. While this isn't always an issue, it doesn't particularly instill confidence.<br /><br />This lotion uses what the manufacturer calls MLE Technology along with Defensamide and Ceramides along with Squalane for moisturizing. It is noted as being good for all ages including babies and children.<br /><br />While I had some concerns, I'm overall pleased with the product's performance. This is a white, smooth lotion that applies easily. I'd actually just had some seasonal allergy reactions on my skin while working in the yard and opted to use this on my skin. It soothed my skin greatly and has gone to work surprisingly rapidly to calm down my inflamed, swollen skin. I'm actually quite impressed.<br /><br />There's no scent that I can detect.<br /><br />In terms of value, this is fairly modest. While this is being advertised as somewhat of a premium lotion, I'm not sure I can justify continued use - we'll see how it continues to do and if I notice a definite improvement over other products. However, I definitely can't deny that it's effective and it is definitely making my skin look and feel better.<br /><br />Zeroid is noted as the #1 Dermacosmetic in Korea for the last decade. It's easy to understand why as this product works incredibly well and surprisingly quickly.<br /><br />Overall, while I am a bit concerned about the manufacturing date and the price point is a touch high I'll continue to use and compare it to other available products. For now, I'll say I'm impressed and happy with the lotion's performance on my troubled skin.\n",
      "3172->Instant Updo | 5 | 2 | I like these clips because you have the option of threading a scarf or ribbons through them.<br />I have longer hair, but its very fine.<br />As you can see, even fine hair stays securely up.<br />Nice assortment of designs.<br />The hinges are on the tight side. They appear to be well made but time will tell.<br />The teeth do not bend. Some of the ends of the teeth on some of them have a bit of roughness, as if they need to be filed smooth. Not taking any points away for that, given the low price point.\n",
      "3175->Four extra large shower caps with adjustable cinch strap; best for those with lots of hair | 3 | 2 | There are four typical no-frills extra large shower caps (red, tan, purple, and black). They fit me but have lots of room to spare. They are waterproof as the water just runs right off the exterior. There is an elasticized strap in the cap that can be adjusted. I adjusted one of them and it looked very lopsided on my head as a result of the adjustment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not my favorite caps. They are too big and the adjustment throws the elastic out of whack. The current price of $11.99 comes to $4 per cap.\n",
      "3177->LOVE the EYEBROW GEL, Not so much the Lipsticks | 4 | 2 | I LOVE the eyebrow gel in this set, and the eye shadows are nice, but the lipsticks, eh.<br /><br />The comparable cost of JUST the eyebrow gel was $1.50 less, so I figured I would give the other products a try.  It was worth it.  I can always give the lipsticks (2) away and just use the shadows (definitely worth the tiny bit more it cost!!).\n",
      "3182->3-1. Love the purple | 4 | 2 | Of the three wigs here, the purple is the best. I would give that wig 5 stars. The colour is fantastic; it's not the same purple all over; it's got different shades and the hairline is fantastic.<br />The black wig is bad. I'd give that 2 stars. It's super shiny but the worst thing is that there is NO way I can hide my hairline unless I pull the wig farther down on my forehead. It's also not cut that well, but that's possible to fix. The hairline issue is not fixable.<br />The grey wig---I love that one too. My second favourite. It's got those great dark roots. It is very long so tangling may be an issue depending on use. But it looks great, fits well etc. So.. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.<br />Overall a great deal as long as I accept that one wig is fairly useless for me.\n",
      "3184->Only three it’s in the packet not six. | 3 | 2 | Love the idea of his pen. Just got mine. But I am a little disappointed. Most the images showed SIX pens in the packet. There are only THREE. He’s better be some pretty darn good spritzers and pens. Little marketing advice to y’all. You need to use proper images according to what you’re offering. Yes I noticed in small print that it’s at three in a packet. But when you show several pens in every picture that’s what people see first. Just a little FYI if you want people thinking you’re trying to deceive or mislead them.<br /><br />Giving a three star for now until I actually use them. Just not too thrilled about how they were advertised.\n",
      "3190->Love it but packaging is a pain | 4 | 2 | I got this as a present, but I am not new to Nubian heritage brand. I had used green tea and avocado scent before. The new blend read goat milk and I thought a goat...really? But I got to be honest, the scent is pleasant and not goaty in the sense that you would stink like goats butt. In fact, it is probably the best lotion out there because my body just inhales it. I coat the skin and it absorbs fast, it does not just sit on top and irritate my nervous system until i wash it off. Nothing like it. This is great in terms of absorbancy and moisture delivery.<br />As others pointed out, the packaging blows big time. I can deal with it, but it is annoying. Definitely would hate if they changed the formula to thin it out for the sake of working with the packaging, so I just hope they find a solution with a jar or some other package/shape.\n",
      "3191->Not for German Sheppards, atleast not our GSD's | 3 | 2 | Saw this and thought this would be great! Saw the reviews and was like YES! Got the cleaner added water, Biggest German Sheppard came in went to put his paw in the cleaner and NOPE! His paws are too big! Ok his sister (smaller) came in tried putting her smaller paw in and NOPE! Her paw didnt fit either so... black lab came in and tried his much smaller paw and .... SUCCESS. Worked like a charm! Fast and easy! Just wish it would fit the German Sheppards 🙁<br />Need to make WOLF size.<br />Great product! Just wont fit our GSD's\n",
      "3195->Super Moisturizing | 5 | 2 | Does dry weather get you down because your hands feel uncomfortable and dry? Welcome to the experience of J.R. Watkins hand creams. I've tried nearly every scent and love them all. I have a lavender one I love using at night. This one is great for daytime as it is floral scented. You really don't need a lot so it lasts a lot longer than other less rich hand creams. This one is super moisturizing with luxurious shea butter, apricot kernel oil, coconut oil, aloe leaf juice and safflower seed oil. It also has a calming flower extract. So your hands get pampered to the max. I've pretty much stopped buying other hand creams and just reach for this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "3213->Whip Your Skin Into Shape | 5 | 2 | I love this body whip! I keeps my skin super hydrated and my feet are baby smooth.<br />The usual cost is around $4.00 if you can find it at a retail location. This product is far overpriced at Amazon.\n",

      "3248->Disappointed | 1 | 2 | Brought this hair for my birthday and was so disappointed.  It had completely matted in 2 days. Although I pre washed, treated with leaving conditioner and curly hair products. While away on vacation I had to remove my clip-in and de-tangle what seemed to be dread locks... it was bad.<br /><br />I took evey step to insure this hair stayed tangle free with included finger combing day and night.<br />Disappointed to say the least.<br /><br />The image is after 2 days of wear and the results after I brush and combed it out... hours of my time when I could have been enjoying my vacation.\n",
      "3249->Impossible for me | 2 | 2 | 1. The packaging is terrible. The lashes are stacked on top of each other with no distinction between which is the top lash and which it the bottom. After getting them all separated, it took a little while to sort out which was which.<br /><br />2. There are only two magnets on each lash--one at each end. Therefore, the middle portion leaves a gap where it does not sit flush to the eye. If a heavy eyeliner line is used it will hide the gap, but I don't wear thick eyeliner.<br /><br />3. I tried for two hours to get these on correctly. The magnets do not release from the applicator well, so each time I tried to move the applicator, it pulled the lashes away from my eyelashes. I tried applying without the applicator, but that was almost impossible as well.<br /><br />They are more of a natural looking lash, so I'm very disappointed I can't use them.\n",
      "3255->Both Work Great | 5 | 2 | I saw this and really wanted to try it since it came with both shampoo and conditioner.  You always have to purchase them separately.  The price is actually pretty good for what you get.  A little goes a long way.  I haven't been using this very long, but I have already noticed a difference in my hair shedding in the shower. Both have a good scent without being too overpowering. These actually leave my hair feeling and looking healthier. My hair has started to thin out and I wanted to stop it before it got too bad. It really leaves my hair feeling clean and restored. I do wash my hair daily with this shampoo and conditioner, but the bottle has lasted a long time. I put the shampoo on my wet hair in the shower and massage into my scalp, leave on for a minute, and then wash out with the warm shower water.  I then do the same with the conditioner.  I love all of the natural ingredients and that they do not test on animals. I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />I received this product at discount for my honest testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own. While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product. Again, it is just my opinion, your own opinion might vary. I received no monetary compensation and I am not required to give a good review.\n",
      "3270->It was sort of easy to use and stayed up all day. | 3 | 2 | After taking it down I smoothed out the metal wires.  And I used it again the next day.  So far, the wires have held.  I've been using it for 3days so far and no problems.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is really just my problem, not a problem with the item.<br /><br />My arms aren't able to go back far enough to get my hair close to the ends before I roll it up.  That makes it so my hair isn't very smooth and it rolls up with ends of hair sticking out in places<br /><br />I've used the same one about a dozen times and it still has some life left.\n",
      "3273->BAD packaging | 3 | 2 | The cream itself is nice.  The package it's in however - to get the first 'dose' out of the tube I had to squeeze harder, and harder, until finally it released about 1/3 of the package in one explosive spurt.<br />what a waste!\n",

Basically I hairbrush that gets your children to brush your hair is a winner for me. As a mom you'd know what I'm talking about.<br /> But for me I also like it. I really like the big one. I don't have a ton of hair but I have very wavy not very thick hair. The wooden bristles are kind of massaging on my scalp! Lol it's pretty nice.<br /><br /> I bought other products from the same company. Like recently I got these wooded toothbrushes, and I really like those as well they produce high-quality product.<br /><br /> In the health food store the other day I saw a very similar hairbrush made out of wood.

      "3299->Missing a brush! | 2 | 2 | I'm missing a brush 😞.<br /><br />I searched all over. Then when I went back to the box and counted the plastic covers for each brush I figured out that it wasn't sent at all. Very sad. Otherwise the product seems decent, I'm just unhappy to have bought a 10 piece set and only received 9.\n",
      "3302->Works well and quickly | 4 | 2 | For more than a decade I've been using Panasonic brand nose hair trimmers, and found them all initially very functional, but soon running much more slowly than I would wish. My current one has a feature to clean it out by opening a drain hole, but doing so never seems to accomplish anything.<br /><br />This Maswater nose hair trimmer is in some ways simpler, but that's better in my opinion. To clean it out, the head can be twisted and popped off, then cleaned out with a brush included in the battery compartment. (Turns out the Panasonic's head also twists off for better cleaning access, but I never knew that until I tried it tonight.)<br /><br />Of the two, the Maswater runs more quickly than the Panasonic on the same AA battery, which is good for finishing promptly. The Maswater also includes a very dim built-in LED light, though I couldn't imagine that helping me in any way while trimming hairs from either my nose or ears.<br /><br />The real test will be how long the Maswater continues to run quickly. I'm on my third Panasonic, after the prior two slowed so much as to be useless. For now, both work, but I'll be reaching for the Maswater first, so long as it continues to work well.\n",
      "3310->OK but not great for me | 3 | 2 | I have very thick, very coarse hair growth on my face.  Shaving and I have never been friends.  I usually can only use a Mach III blade 2 times (3 times max) before I have to throw it away, else it turns my face into blood salad.<br /><br />As such, electric shavers have never done that good of a job on my face.  I always use an electric shaver first to get the big chunks of hair off so that the Mach III can go in for precision, but in no way shape or form can I use an electric shaver alone and then go out into public.  This is especially true of the neck area.<br /><br />For years, I've been using the Norelco line of shavers (most recently the 3000) as my choice.  The three-circle-blades-in-a-triangle works best for me, especially on that stubborn neck area.  It isn't necessarily the closest shave, but it does get the most hair removed overall.  And its usable in the shower.<br /><br />Enter this Wahl shaver.  Right out the gate, I'll say that on the parts it does shave properly (flat open areas like sideburns), it cuts super close.  It also charges very quickly, behaves well in the shower, and is easy to clean.  But that doesn't really set it apart, since many shavers also do this.  I like the carry bag it comes with.<br /><br />What I don't like is that it does REALLY bad work on the curved parts of the face such as the aforementioned neck area.  In fact, it's almost useless there.  I had to clean up with the Norelco after using the Wahl, and I did several test runs.  The Wahl performed a little bitter with shaving cream, but then again, so does the Norelco.<br /><br />Maybe if your face isn't gnarly and coarse like mine, this Wahl is for you. But I can't really recommend it for guys like me when there are better, cheaper options available.\n",
      "3311->It also leaves a nice clean, hydrated look and feel--though skin can be ... | 3 | 2 | Removes my tinted sun block, dirt and grime very well. It also leaves a nice clean, hydrated look and feel--though skin can be left feeling very tacky in summer due to the glycerine content. But you can just rinse your face.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product makes me break out. I am not a huge fan of lavender oil for the face given possible sun sensitivity (I have pigmentation) hormone disruption and general irritation from essential oils. I personally like the scent, but like some, I found it strong at first.<br /><br />I'm using it as an eye make up remover now, since it irritates the skin on my face within a few days of each use. NOTE, I have sensitive skin, so not everyone will have the reaction I did. With that said, not every product I use causes break-outs.<br /><br />Seems like a great Micellar water for those who like the ingredients and the scent of lavender, because it does clean the skin well.\n",
      "3316->Not as easy as hoped, and with somewhat disappointing results | 3 | 2 | This sounded like it would be fast and easy, but it really doesn't work for my hair. You still have to part your hair into fairly thin sections, just as with a curling or straightening iron, and each section takes two or three strokes before it lies straight and curves under a bit. Then even if you get it to curve under, it doesn't last. The brush doesn't leave my (colored and highlighted) hair sleek and smooth--instead it leaves it kind of fluffy and frizzy.<br />The instructions say to use it only on clean hair, not hair with any product build-up on it, and this is absolutely true! If you have any hairspray on your hair--like if you try to use the brush on a day when you haven't just washed your hair, the brush will not go through. It kind of gets glued into your hair and you have to struggle to get it out, with some tearing and popping sounds as you do so, and an even frizzier appearance afterwards. So for me, it's back to the straightening iron.\n",
      "3321->It's a party!  And SO hard to remove! | 3 | 2 | This is a nice change of pace option.  Looks good with the pink base I used. Needs a top coat or else it leaves a rough surface with the glitter. Stayed on well and didn't chip for close to two weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm editing this a month later.  Still think it's beautiful and fun, but it's so hard to get off I won't use it again unless it's a VERY special occasion. I had to SOAK my fingers in polish remover several times for several minutes to slowly get it off.  And that was a problem because that dried out my skin and nails hugely.  My fingers were very rough and scaly for a week.  Nothing permanent, but annoying and holy cow!  So, don't soak!\n",

      "3331->I've had Better | 3 | 2 | I have a pretty narrow shaped yet, not big. And the bonnet is still too tight. Tight enough to give me a headache so I can't use it. Sucks, but, maybe I just got a big head.<br />Besides that it's okay, nothing special. Breathable and definitely holds your hair in\n",
      "3340->After Three Weeks of Use | 3 | 2 | Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.<br /><br />There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.<br /><br />But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.\n",
      "3341->2 stars for what’s in the kit. | 2 | 2 | I thought I was going to like this kit. All the reviews were great but it’s so sticky! Once you have the slip solution on, you can’t add more product, it won’t stick to the old gel that’s already in The dual forms. I also didn’t like that the dual forms didn’t have lines for measurement.<br /><br />It’s too bad I can’t send this back.  Not worth the money.\n",

My skin is Cool tone, white highlighter is create too pale for me.<br />- Con: When you see this item in person, it doesn't look like same color as shown picture.

      "3364->Doesn't Match My Hair Color | 4 | 2 | I had a heck of a time trying to figure out which one matched my hair color the best, and let me say...I failed. What seemed to me like a light brown on the screen actually had a tint of red, which I definitely do not. The picture doesn't do it justice, but in real life it's easy to tell.<br />However, subjectively, I still want to give it four stars because the hair looks quite real and it was easy to just snap over a bun. And if I had found the right color, I think it would have been very cute.\n",

      "3383->great but... | 3 | 2 | The actual product is actually pretty great, they have good pigmentation, nice colors, and a reasonable amount of product, the reason that I am only giving it 3 stars is because<br /><br />1.the brushes are way too small to be useful<br />2.the mirrors are in a ridiculous and not very efficient place<br />3. One of the containers was broken (major crack in the lid)<br />4. Two of the blushes were busted (ironically, neither of them were in the broken container)<br /><br />Overall, I would probably recommend it based on the cheap price. But that doesn't mean it is amazing\n",
      "3390->Triple-threat Charger from Anker! | 4 | 2 | The Anker 42W USB Quick Charger is another great product from Anker. I use it to charge my LGV10 and LGG4 as well as a couple of tablets.  Having 3 ports on 1 device is very convenient, and the single quick charge port charges FAST!  The other two ports feature Anker's power IQ technology which automatically adjusts output to fit the device being charged.<br /><br />The device is extremely well built, something that is synonymous with Anker products.  Dimensions are slightly larger than I expected, and weight is also on the heavier than expected side. That said, build quality is very important to me, and this product screams quality, so I am happy.<br /><br />I'll be taking this charger on a month long trip to Europe next month and I am certain it will serve me well. Overall an excellent device with only perhaps small room for improvement in both size and weight.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.\n",
      "3398->Great protectant | 5 | 2 | This is a &#34;must&#34; for anyone that uses heat on their hair.  I have naturally curly/frizzy hair that I absolutely hate, so I blow-dry and straighten my hair every day.  That is a lot of heat for hair to withstand.  This blow dry spray protects my hair from all that heat.<br /><br />My process is as follows:<br />I wash and gently towel dry my hair, then spray this on my damp hair.<br />I then blow dry my hair, straightening it as I dry.<br />Then I &#34;lightly&#34; spray this on my hair prior to using my flat iron.<br />I have then protected my hair before the heat of the dryer, and then again before the heat of the flat iron.<br /><br />Argan oil is wonderful helps me prevent the frizzies that accompany curly hair.  It gives it a healthy, smooth shine that I haven't had since my teenage years.<br /><br />The pump itself is very easy to use.  Traveling quite a bit, it is nice that there is a &#34;safety&#34; switch that you change push to keep it from spraying in your suitcase.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my unbiased review.\n",
      "3400->Not as good as the original Sonicare | 2 | 2 | I purchased this as a replacement for the original Sonicare for my husband and myself. I bought the set with two units and one charger. Even though I like the new brush head and noticed its brushing action is improved with this model, I found that one of the units (the one I use) doesn't hold a charge very long.  The old one went two weeks.  I am lucky if this one goes a week. Sometimes 4 days is all it stays charged.  The unit my husband uses hold a charge for at least 2 weeks just like the older model.<br /><br />I called customer service and they had me perform some tests and put the phone up by it so she could hear the sounds when doing the tests. She said it was fine as it passed the tests.  She advised me to return it to the charger daily if necessary.  I explained that my husband's didn't need that frequent charging and she just ignored that fact.<br /><br />I was considering getting one of the newest models and seeing if they are any better, but might just switch to Oral B, as that is what my dentist uses.\n",
      "3406->Good, cute hairband for washing face | 5 | 2 | I bought this for my sister to keep her hair out of her face when she washes her face. It's a cute headband and works very well. One thing to note is that when you first see it, the unstretched circumference is quite small. No worries though, it fits on my sister's head and she has a big head. It's a good, snug fit so the headband doesn't move around and no hair gets loose.<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that it's double wrapped, so the head band is clean and free of dust. I've also been able to machine wash it to clean it so that's a plus too.\n",
      "3410->teeny weeny headbands | 1 | 2 | I bought these for stocking stuffers and out of the 4 of us it did not fit any of us.  Way too small for a headband.<br />Maybe it would work for a little girl.\n",
      "3411->Not physically possible | 1 | 2 | Asked a biologist friend of mine about this and she said it is physically impossible to make hair grow faster. Literally NOTHING will work. Softer, shinier, smoother? Yes. Grow quicker? No.<br />Your hair grows at pretty much a set pace and there isn’t a thing anyone can do about it.\n",
      "3419->Thick & Creamy | 5 | 2 | A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "3424->Works! And seller replaced the defective unit 🙂 | 5 | 2 | Definitely zapping some of those course hairs.  Mine does not seem to function the way intended. The knob seems to control nothing. Does not turn it off or change charge, seemingly. When I hold in my left hand, my finger gets zapped a bit, but not in my right hand. I am thinking it’s because I have my Apple Watch on my left, so be sure to remove all jewelry first!<br /><br />I watched a video on you tube first.  I have red hair and some of my hair is dark at the tip and light at the root plus I have freckles. This can make finding the follicle/pore challenging. However I have removed a lot of these suckers. Even removed an especially egregious one from my upper lip. No more painful than tweezing. After I finish my chin, will prolly go for the upper lip stash hairs.<br /><br />Clue that you are in the right spot is when a lot of the white stuff comes out right away. Definitely a home run 😃. One star off for the control knob issue.<br /><br />I should have returned it immediately for exchange when I realized it was not working properly. But I reached out to the seller and they will replace the defective unit. So 5 stars\n",
      "3431->YUM! | 5 | 2 | Found this lotion on a whim at a Bath and Body Outlet shop, and LOVE IT!<br />The scent remimds me when you walk into a bakery, but yummier.<br />If I had my way, this would be a scent that was made into a candle and plug in.\n",
      "3432->Loved Two Movies! | 4 | 2 | If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...\"Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?\" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "3437->Pros and cons | 3 | 2 | So the actual products are great. I love the smell. Kinda reminded me of sunscreen (in a good way). Soak disolved fast and smelled good. The whipped soap was super moisturizing. The scrub was like those silca beads not ground nuts. So soft. The body butter was great.<br />The packaging almost made me not want to try any of it though. With completely dry hands I couldn't rip the tops off any of the packs. I had to cut them with scissors. The ziplock tops were difficult to open too. I get that it is a travel set but the pack were so small that getting the product out was difficult.  Loved everything but would only get them in full size again.\n",
      "3448->A little bit goes a long way. | 5 | 2 | We love this C. Silver cream and the Healing salve.<br />We are a older couple and some places our skin needs a little help.<br />Great service also, Thank you\n",
      "3450->Not right… | 1 | 2 | They sent me one pack when it says 3 packs for 20.<br />I love these wipes and the product is great! Not complaining about the product I just kept them and didn’t return them even though I should have but just didn’t want to at the time.\n",
      "3458->Not effective for my already slightly curled lashes | 3 | 2 | I didn’t realize this item came straight from China ( although it was obviously in stock in the US). There is Chinese writing on the box and the directions were obviously with translated (pretty well) or written by someone who didn’t know Englis as well as they should.<br /><br />The product arrives nicely packaged in a nice box.  Battery is not included.<br /><br />I thought the ridges of the heating element would be longer to act as more of a comb. They are not.  You are pushing the lashes with this - not combing thru them.<br /><br />My lashes have some curl - I saw very small improvement with this tool - I’ve tried both heat settings.<br /><br />The light does not turn when it is hot - but you can definitely feel it.<br /><br />Ergonomically this tool is a good size and easy to hold.<br /><br />I didn’t realize when I ordered this that you use it AFTER mascara is applied.  Make sure you clean it every time you use it.<br /><br />Overall for me this has little value and seems like more of a gimmick.  Maybe if my lashes were straighter that would not be the case.\n",
      "3466->Great gift! Guaranteed smile :) | 5 | 2 | [[VIDEOID:a856f6500f7b03dea61554295d2d4ed7]] PROS:<br />I'm satisfied with the variety and looks, so did my gf.<br />The unicorn horn-themed handles are curly and provide a good grip<br />The tuffs are colorful with these neon colors, also fantasy themed.<br />The brushes are functional and have salon-level quality<br />Twelve bucks is a decent price<br />Tuffs come in a wide variety of shapes, thicknesses, top cut, and bristle count<br /><br />CONS: none found<br /><br />Conclusion: On cannot go wrong with this set.\n",
      "3469->Dislike quality | 1 | 2 | VERY hard!<br />Had to take hair dryer to it to melt it so I could even use it.<br />Disappointed<br />Not cheap!\n",
      "3470->Quit working after 12 days | 2 | 2 | Worked for 12 days, but on the 12th day, when it ran out of water and I pushed to button to turn it off, it would not turn off.  The Mode button also had ceased to work.  After about a minute of me pushing buttons and shaking it, if quit and indicated the battery was exhausted.  So much for going 30 days as advertised.  I recharged it for about 6 hours until it glowed green indicating a full charge, and I disconnected the cord for charging and pressed the on button but nothing and it immediately indicated it needed to be recharged.<br /><br />When it worked, I was not thrilled with it.  It has three buttons in a row at the top, the top one being the one to release the little nozzle wand for want of a better term, the second one the on/off button and the third being the mode button.  When you go  to use it, and you decide to stop while it still has water in it, you need to turn it off while keeping the nozzle wand in your mouth so you don't shoot water everywhere but you cannot see the buttons so you just start pushing and maybe you will get lucky and hit the power button, but just as often, you will hit the mode button and it just starts working at a different pressure as you grope around.  My solution was to not stop when I wanted to but keep going until it ran out, then pull it away from my face far enough to  find the buttons and turn it off.<br /><br />It is not practical to try to rotate the nozzle wand so is easier to use by just rotating the whole unit which means you lose track of where the buttons even are.\n",
      "3472->surprisingly very nice gift assortment, well packaged, definitely gift worthy | 5 | 2 | Smells SO Good!!!  I'll add in some pics as the product pictures shown here dont do this justice. The contents are in a sturdy flip top box makes it look like a gift (and was shipped in a regular box, maintaining integrity of the product box). Almost reminds me of a subscription box as the deign on the outside gives it a special look. It kinda threw me off because I nearly expected more of a generic look. I thought, ooh did someone send me something? lol. But no, I ordered this lol<br /> Once I opened the box, a colorful, glossy card stock card with the phrase, \"Happy Birthday to You\" on one side, and totally blank on the other. This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I'll use everything. Personally, I use bath bombs in my shower as I dont take baths, or I use as a foot soak.\n",
      "3481->Unimpressed by this brow pen | 3 | 2 | It's a little lighter than I thought it would be. But my main gripe is that it's far to easily smudged. It feels greesey when applied. And I've had much better quality brow pens that have cost less than half as much. Will not be buying again.<br />To be clear, I have very dark hair but soarce brows. This pen would not be ideal for something like me. Possibly it would be good for someone who is simply just adding a little to their brows.\n",
      "3489->Good, but not \"fabulous\" | 3 | 2 | I read a lot of good reviews on this hair care product and decided to try it for myself. First, I have fine hair that tangles easily after washing and detangler products are a must and I'm quite particular about what I use. I actually prefer spray over cream products, but over all the Total Vitamin Leave-in cream did distribute through my hair better then most creams I've used, but it didn't help entirely with my tangles. I cant really comment on the effectiveness of the Keratin Heat Protector since I don't cook my hair with blow driers, and curling or flat irons. As for the Argan Oil Serum...it's good, but ranks second from my favorite Marrakesh Argan Oil serum.<br /><br />Overall, these products are okay, but nothing to write home about. My biggest concern was when I was using these 3 products, my hair seemed to fall out...and I mean hair loss by the clumps. Never had this happen before. I didn't panic right away and blame it on the products, but after a week or so, I discontinued using Milania products and went back to my prior products and immediately noticed no hair falling out. So did the Milania products have something to do with my hair falling out? I can't say for certain, but I did read a review here that someone else experienced hair falling out too. I understand that everyone's hair & scalp is different and mine seem to react poorly, so use your own judgement call on whether you want to try these products.<br /><br />Aside from \"possible\" hair loss, the products smelled incredible, distributed easily in hair, and didnt leave any residue feeling in my hair. So my final judgement on Milania hair care is that it's basic stuff and, in my opinion, overrated and didn't live up to all the hype. It didn't get my tangles out with ease, didn't leave my hair silky smooth soft and frizz-free as boasted. Its okay, but not \"great\"...expecially for the price. There's other products out there that work just as good or better for less money.\n",
      "3495->Disappointed | 1 | 2 | Product was not damaged however upon looking elsewhere I found a much bigger product at much less of a cost!<br /><br />Also, if you return back your stuck paying shipping and for free shipping originally it’s a shame to have pay for return it granted $4.20 isn’t much but in reality it is when shipping to me was free!<br /><br />Not a way to get and keep costumers!\n",
      "3505->Heavy, Greasy, Doesn't Absorb - Will Retry In The Winter | 3 | 2 | I was fully prepared to fall in love with this USDA Certified Organic eye cream. I never use conventional products & am always thrilled to find new organic products. Sadly, as of right now (summer), this cream is no good to me. I am hoping that it will serve me better in the winter.<br /><br />It is very heavy, greasy, & sticky and it doesn't absorb. It just sits on my skin. My hair & pillow stick to it. I only use a teeny dab, I'm talking teeny tiny, & it is way more than enough to put around both of my sensitive middle aged eyes. This 2 oz. pot will last forever (or at least until it goes bad).<br /><br />I am a full time eco farmer who lives in a historic late 1700's log cabin. I don't have air conditioning. This means that where I live in the summer the humidity is very very high & it is very hot. This also means that in the winter, my air is very very very dry because I heat my home solely with a wood stove.<br /><br />I am telling you this because I am hoping that this eye cream will serve me well in the winter when my skin is screaming for hydration. Right now though with humidity & heat is high as it is, this stuff is total overkill. It just feels gross. I put this in the refrigerator in hopes that it will keep long enough for me to try it come winter. Normally, I'd wait to review, but I have reviewer time requirements, so here I am. I will be sure to return to update my review as/if needed.<br /><br />Note: This is packaged in plastic not glass. I find it so frustrating when organic brands do this.\n",
      "3512->It's a no from me | 2 | 2 | These are half the size of regular incense sticks. The scents are pleasant out of the box, but it really doesn't matter when the burn time is so short. The aroma comes and goes before you have time to remember you lit an incense.<br /><br />Their size reduces them to a novelty item only. In functionality, these are a wash and not worth $20.\n",
      "3513->I saw this item recommended on a skincare forum and it had good reviews ... | 3 | 2 | I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about this product. I saw this item recommended on a skincare forum and it had good reviews so I tried it out. I have oily/dehydrated skin and I just wanted something that would help keep my eye makeup put throughout the day.<br /><br />On my first use, I put some on a cotton pad all over my face and it IMMEDIATELY dried out my skin. Since that first day, I've been using a moisturizer, then a moisturizing primer, and the wiping Mehron over only my oily areas (t-zone, nose, eyelids) and it's helped me stay matte all day and keeps my eyeshadow looking fresh til the evening.<br /><br />I'll keep trying and testing this item out. But in the month I've been using it, I give it 3 stars.\n",
      "3516->A decent hydrating treatment | 3 | 2 | When I first began to use this I was slightly obsessed with it. It made my hair soft and manageable. Right around the same time I began using a daily shampoo and conditioner called Promise. I initially thought the results I was getting were from this treatment but then the seller shot the price up from $13 to $19 and I stopped using it for awhile. My hair was still soft and manageable and I've since discovered that it was the Promise shampoo and conditioner that was really doing the work although this did give it a nice boost. I went from using it several times a week to about once a week to once every two weeks. Although I still like it, and it does leave my hair hydrated, it isn't the miracle product I thought it was at first. It's still a decent treatment that is reasonably priced and I will continue to buy it as long as the seller doesn't hike the price up again (they hiked it up and then dropped it back down).<br />Overall a decent product with a reasonable price. I do recommend the Promise products more though. Promise products also contain hair loss ingredients and ingredients that have been clinically shown to slow hair loss. I had some stress hair loss a few years back and have an ongoing hair loss condition now. The Promise products seemed to slow that as well as leaving my hair awesomely shiny and soft. This treatment works well in conjunction with Promise products.\n",
      "3525->True to claims | 3 | 2 | Smooth metal surfaces, and light enough to hold in place with a patient with fine hair. Now to come up with ideas of how use it.<br /><br />One small drawback, the arrow is a bit long for the hoop but accurate to the picture.\n",
      "3526->Optiphen Plus - NOT Germall Plus | 2 | 2 | Optiphen is pretty good as a preservative and similar to Germall, but they are not the same. If I order Germall, I want Germall. Do a little research online. They are mostly interchangeable, but there are slight differences in the suggested ph range, max temp, and max usage.<br />Germall ingredients: Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate<br />Optiphen ingredients: Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n",
      "3527->Only okay - was broken and stuffed in a small bag so petals look flattened. | 3 | 2 | I ordered 2 red ones.  They both came squished in a tiny plastic bag.  I had to fluff them once I got them out and even then some petals are bent to far down and don't look right.  I needed this for a costume, so it's not a huge deal if they aren't &#34;perfect&#34;, but confused WHY they would stuff them in a tiny plastic bag?<br /><br />The flower themselves are a nice color, but they are bigger than expected.. again not a huge deal.<br /><br />What did disappoint me though is the bag of one of them was completely off and rolling around the small bag... it looked like it was just hot glued on.  Thankfully I have a hot glue and was able to fix it... but it seems like it could easily fall off.<br /><br />The positives:  I like the color and the backing when it actually sticks on.. it has a clip and a pin.\n",
      "3534->Their working for me! | 4 | 2 | These sponges are a great addition to my makeup routine. The Texture is Smooth and Blends my Foundation well. I love the size too! They are smaller than my usual ones and are Perfect to get my Under Eye Concealer blended Evenly.<br /><br />The jar is cute and looks Great on my counter. I’m Happy I gave them a try! I hope this review helps you.\n",
      "3547->Dislike it more than initially | 3 | 2 | I’m revising my review and deducting a star. I’d already mentioned how CRAZY BAD this burns if it gets in your eyes, but it bears repeating. The new info here is that 2 of my household users get an itchy scalp after use. Maybe “diamond powder” as its 9th active ingredient isn’t such a fabulous idea??<br /> * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />Ingredients: Aqua (Water/Eau), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamide MIPA, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycol Distearate, Diamond Powder, Emblica Officinalis Fruit Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Seed Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Silicone Quaternium-16, Polyquaternium-7, Undeceth-11, Butyloctanol, Polyquaternium-10, Undeceth-5, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.<br /><br />I ended up liking this shampoo more than I thought I would. I took a spin around AIIR’s website, a brand I was previously unfamiliar with. Their lane is definitely upmarket holistic+New Age-y. (And those two words shouldn’t be mutually exclusive IMO). I’m personally not a big fan of hawking diamonds and crystals and other marketing hooks that aren’t scientifically proven to actually benefit hair. It jacks up the price point and borders upon gimmicky. However, finding truly fragrance-free shampoo is not an easy task… and this indeed is. And they are also Leaping Bunny certified, which I verified because I’m persnickety like that. Some small cruelty-free labels are still owned by a large parent company that isn’t Leaping Bunny certified, but AIIR is fully good to go. So high marks there.<br /><br />The formula lathers a lot more than I expected. Here the Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate replaces the heavier sulfate that’s usually found in the first couple of ingredients; it’s a very mild surfactant, yet lathers quite well and rinses out easily. As a lot of newer generation brands are replacing now-vilified ingredients, I should note that the way we get Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate technically involves ethylene oxide— which is not without controversy. In 20 years it’ll also be replaced by something even better/safer. But for now, this is a very friendly cleanser option and my color-treated hair appreciates it.<br /><br />My mom and have radically different hair types; she’s got thin, baby fine hair that needs body and I have thick, coarse, curls that I try hard to tame and de-volumize. Both of us didn’t have remarkable results after using this, but we did note our hair felt pretty soft. While I don’t know if I believe all of AIIR’s claims here about hair growth, I am impressed that the two of us could share a shampoo… as that’s something we can usually never do. This also preforms well in hard water.<br /><br />I'm leaving it 4 stars because of how much it stung my eyes when some suds fell into them during my shower. And because of the diamond nonsense. You also don’t get a lot vs price point. But for gentle yet effective cleansing in a truly fragrance-free formula, yeah, not bad! Nice choice for a guest bathroom as this shouldn’t trigger many allergies, is gender neutral, and can work on all hair types.<br /><br />This was a Vine item for me but unless I see some ‘wow’ factor pretty soon, once this is gone I don’t plan to buy any outright.\n",
      "3553->Great scent, good hold and volume, rinses poorly | 3 | 2 | After having had a 1/4-inch buzzcut for about 15 years, about 18 months ago, I started growing out my hair, which is now quite long and sits around the bottom of my ear. As a result, I've been using different types of hair products to style it in different ways and keep it under control. Given a chance to try this pomade, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Packaging-wise, this is really simple: a glass jar with a metal lid. It has that old-timey barbershop feel, and would look nice on your counter or shelf, if you're into displaying your grooming products. Just remember it's glass, and an accidental drop on your counter or tiled floor is going to result in a disaster. The lid is a good quality and the seal seems to keep the product fresh.<br /><br />As soon as you open this jar, you'll recognize that \"barbershop scent\". It has that minty-eucalyptus odor that's refreshing and eye-opening. There are days when I use this, when I'm sitting at my desk I wonder \"what smells so good\"...and I realize it's my hair. So if you're into good scents and smelling-good for yourself or others, you'll definitely like this.<br /><br />The consistency of this product is quite interesting. It looks like vanilla pudding. However, it's definitely much thicker than vanilla pudding. It's not sticky. It feels and looks like a compound that would end up very oily in your hair, but that's not the result. Even given my hair's length, I don't have to use a lot of this, and typically on damp hair I only have to use about two fingertips' worth of this product in my hair.<br /><br />While your mileage may vary, when I put this in my hair, it has an immediate effect. It provides immediate styling strength. It also helps to add a bit of volume, so that as I comb it through, I can easily prop-up the parts of my hair to give it a little volume and height. It dries well and doesn't get too stiff, leaving my hair with some movement, where I'm not afraid to run my fingers through it or adjust it. I'd say it's really good for my more \"casual day\" styles.<br /><br />My only complaint, and for me this is really important, is that it doesn't rinse well in the shower. I only wash my hair every third day to maintain its health, and while nearly every other product I use rinses almost cleanly without leaving much of a residue, this particular product won't rinse cleanly. This becomes a problem if I use this on day two, but want to use a different product on day 3, for example. It definitely adds to residual build-up. I realize not every product rinses cleanly with just water, but this one is particularly problematic, forcing me to either wash my hair earlier or plan the days on which I use this so the build-up doesn't become an issue on consecutive days. So, if like me, you don't like washing your hair often, this may be a deal-breaker.<br /><br />Overall, though, I'm quite impressed. The small jar is actually going to last me quite some time. It has a great scent and styling power. I'd probably use it every day if it weren't for the rinsing issue.\n",
      "3562->It Works... | 3 | 2 | Arrived out of the original box and was wrapped in bubble wrap.<br />You would think something like a Water Filter would be a little more sterile.<br />Who knows who handled it.\n",
      "3563->Good value | 3 | 2 | I received 25 products, 14 of them were lipgloss and 2 lipstick. I also got 2 mascara, a highlighter, and eyebrow mascara.<br />These products would be a lot more expensive at the store.\n",
      "3565->Pretty packaging, lovely scent 🌹 The best of Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers in a sample size set | 4 | 2 | This is a really nice travel sized set of the Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers, which comes in a cute box, suitable for gifting. The products are deluxe sample sizes, which is a perfect way to try out the line and find your favorite. 🌹<br /><br />I will start off with the Priming Water and Priming Essence. Both of these products come in dropper style ampoules. Neither of mine were filled to the top. These bottles are already on the smaller side, so it was especially disappointing to see missing product. For that, I've docked a star. [see photos attached, including one with a nail polish bottle for scale of sizing.]<br /><br />Both the Essence and Water feels like a light oil in texture. They spread easily, absorb quickly, and are meant to be used as the last step in your skin care. The No Poreblem primer in a tube is your silicone based makeup primer. It has that familiar silky finish, and does do a good job of blurring the pores. This is not so much a pore \"filling\" primer; this one works more to smooth them out, and creates a nice base for your foundation.<br /><br />All of the products in this set have a light rose scent, which smells divine. I am not usually fond of most rosy florals because they are always either too strong, smell artificial, or very old lady-ish. This scent is none of those things. Touch in Sol has nailed the rose fragrance - it's lightweight, very fresh, and I really enjoy it. As someone who is skin sensitive to added fragrance, I had zero reactions to any of these products. 🌹\n",
      "3568->\"Meh\" | 3 | 2 | I've never used 'beard oil' before, so just for the helluvit decided to give some a try, and grabbed the trial pack (original scent).<br /><br />The Oil:<br />At first I thought, \"wow, this smells very 'real'\"; as in, not an artificial, obviously fake smell. It was pretty strong, and ever-present. I was like, \"hmmm, not bad, but also not sure if I want to smell like this to others\". Didn't take long at all before I pretty much hated the scent. It's very 'cedar' like, I guess you could say. Sort of like you are sticking your nose right into a bag of cedar wood chips. At least that's what it smelled like to me.<br /><br />The Balm:<br />This is pretty much just greasy. Feels and smells mostly like you're just rubbing Vaseline on your beard, though a bit lighter.<br /><br />The package:<br />The presentation is actually really nice. Nice little velvet bag with a string, the balm/oil, and even a guitar pick.<br /><br />The result:<br />Yes, my beard felt a *little* softer, and was a *little* less frazzled looking, though not much more than if I just comb it after a shower. I'm not really sure why I'm seeing so many RAVE reviews; it's not *that* great. I can take it or leave it.<br /><br />The price:<br />Here's probably the bigger issue; it's around $6 for this trial, and you really only get about 1, maybe 1.5 uses out of the teeny tiny sample of oil (see pic). I actually feel like I got a little bit ripped off on the price for the amount you get. I'd like to see the trial priced more around the 3/4 dollar mark in total (incl. shipping, et. al.). I'd like to try some different scents, but there's not a chance in Hell I'm paying that amount again for even 1 more sample for that amount of oil, and there're a whole lot of scents to try before you find one that you might like. On the other hand, I saw they offer a trial package of all scents (the same tiny sized bottles), which is cool, but it's $30+ .... no thanks. Drop it to around $10 total and I'll try it. I'd also like to see them offer that same package, minus everything but the oils (no balms, etc.), just to see which scent I like, and make it around say $5 total.<br /><br />All-in-all:<br />It's \"ok\". If I could find the scent that I like w/out dropping a fortune in the process, I'd probably buy the big bottle of it, or even bottle(S) if I found more than 1 scent I liked; possibly regularly. But currently, I think I'll just skip it.\n",
      "3571->A Good One-off Cosplay or Party Wig | 3 | 2 | This wig has a beautiful ombre--one colour blends into the next very nicely without a harsh line. There is a lot of and it's thick, though not overly so. It came packaged with a cute flower garland headband and a lace stocking cap.<br /><br />The wig cap itself is adjustable in the back, however, it doesn't have any hooks/combs in the top or sides to secure it--not a problem, since it's easy enough to use a few strategically placed bobby pins. Also, if you have a large head or a lot of hair, getting this wig to fit might be too much of a struggle. (I had to braid my hair and wrap it a certain way around my scalp to get it flat enough to fit in this wig.) Finally, it's shiny to the point of looking synthetic--dry shampoo helped a great deal toward correcting that--and the part in the center is crazy wide.<br /><br />Considering the price point, I would have awarded this wig the full five stars if those had been the only quibbles. However, it sheds like a Pomeranian and tangles like a kudzu. The shedding goes far beyond your typical wig shed--and you know it's a problem when you get up from a seat and see strands of hair clinging to the seat--and then there's the tangling which can't be undone with a quick pull-through with your fingers--I'm talking fairy knots galore.<br /><br />Now, this isn't a bad wig, which is why I didn't go lower on the stars. In fact, it would be a great one-off or once-in-a-blue-moon cosplay or party wig. But if you're looking for something more substantial, for daily wear, or a serious event, then another wig might be in order.<br /><br />Disclosure: Sample provided for review.\n",
      "3575->I like it..But | 3 | 2 | It doesn't get rid of dry scalp just like all other products it just covers it.. temporarily.. you need to WASH your hair people this is not the solution.. it just cakes up the on the hair.<br />I have been using this to create shine! it does the trick! but in the summer make sure you close your jar very tightly the glossifier melts  If you are traveling put it in a separate bag tightly sealed then put add to your luggage to avoid leakage in your suitcase.\n",
      "3582->Okay but tight | 2 | 2 | These are so cute I’m sad they’re too tight. I mean I can wear them but it’s super uncomfortable. The material is soft doesn’t look cheap.<br />But I’ll never wear them so it Sucks I missed the return date.\n",
      "3591->It's great if you want your clothes ruined. | 1 | 2 | I had to change my original review due to the fact that the oils used in this leave dark or yellow stains in the armpits of our clothes. My favorite dress shirt now appears as if I'm sweating when I just put it on after dry cleaning so cleaning it doesn't help, it's ruined! And of course I can no longer get the shirt. Arghhhhhh<br /><br />This happened to all of the white shirts my wifey has, and several of my other button downs.  I haven't checked tee shirts yet but I'm sure they're also affected. So disappointing as we loved this deodorant originally!<br /><br />*** For some reason, the picture doesn't show how dark the oil stain is.\n",
      "3601->pretty and work great! | 4 | 2 | written my wife of account holder: these are very pretty and they work great! they are supposed to all have cases and i was one case short but i don't mind because, when i quit using one of them, i will just use the case for the other. it will equal out.<br />the thing i don't like is that the colors on the files bleed on to the case but that is such a small thing.<br />these would be cute to give to friends as just a little token. i love them!<br />my MIL had bought me a glass nail file years ago at Hallmark. it lasted probably 8 years before it cracked in half. 5 of these is MORE than enough for one person!\n",
      "3612->Philips PureRadiance Multi-Speed Skin Cleansing System | 4 | 2 | Overall I do like the PureRadiance Skin Cleansing system - it's easy to use and will work well for almost all skin types, however there are more affordable options out there, this one I think is a bit on the pricey side.  The system comes with 2 cleansing heads: a 'normal' one for every day use and an 'exfoliating' one for weekly use.  There are additional heads you can purchase separately, even one for sensitive skin although I find that the normal everyday one that comes with the system is incredibly soft and gentle.  The system also comes with small plastic cover cases for the heads, a small charging base, power cord to charge the unit, and a small zippered case that holds only the unit itself.  I was a little disappointed that they only included a small zippered pouch that only has room for the unit itself, but no room for the different heads, base or power cord.  If you wanted to travel with this system you would need to put it all into a different (larger) bag.<br /><br />The system is super easy to use - the heads snap on easily and remove just as easily.  Once charged you are good to go, and the system is waterproof (but the charging base is not!), so you can even take it in the shower with you.  You can use with or without your favorite facial cleanser, that's your option.  A built-in 1 minute timer with a reminder 'pulse' every 20 seconds helps ensure that you spend equal amounts of time on all parts of your face and that you don't use the system for longer than you should. There are 2 speeds available - slow, and a little bit faster.  It is very quiet, much quieter than my electric toothbrush.  After 1 minute the system turns off, although you can easily turn it on again if you wish to clean your skin even more.<br /><br />I find the base that the unit sits in inadequately sized given the size of the wand.  The wand is a bit long and heavy, and when you set it down in the small and light plastic base it can easily tip over if not propped near something as tall as it is (for example I keep mine in the corner of my counter where 2 corner walls help keep it from tipping).  While it is nice that the base doesn't take up much room, it seems like it needs to be a little more substantial to hold the wand while charging or drying.<br /><br />I've been using this for a few weeks and it's done a wonderful job of helping remove dry, dull dead skin that is a result of the harsh winter air and is leaving my skin softer and smoother.  Using it once a day seems to work well for me, but different options may work better for others - everyone has a different skin type.  The system comes with a 45-day money-back guarantee which might help influence your purchasing decision if you're on the fence about whether you want to actually buy this, and it also comes with a 2 year limited warranty.\n",
      "3613->Ehhhh | 2 | 2 | I'm a makeup artist and I love the Mehron brand but sadly I am not a fan of this product. So far I have only used Mehron paradise paints on it thinking the water activated paints would wash of easily. Nope! There was quite a bit of staining left on the practice head. I've tried face wipes, soap and water, and various cleaning products but the stains are still there. Another thing I'm<br />Not too crazy about is the mouth on this thing. It's open which makes it very difficult to do any sort of work on the mouth area. I only gave the product two stars because I plan on using it as a wig stand now.\n",
      "3618->Time efficient!!! | 4 | 2 | This product is totally worth it!!! I have saved a bunch of time using this product. When i usually wash my brushes, it takes a very very long time to dry. This totally cuts down on my cleaning time.<br /><br />I am genuinely impressed by how simple the product is yet very effective. It is extremely user friendly as it only has 1 button. No way you can go wrong or mess it up somehow. I have uploaded a demonstration so take a gander at that as well.<br /><br />I will not say the brushes completely dried, however it definitely was more than half dry and will dry very very soon. I am still amazed at how fast i finished cleaning my brushes. Give it a go!\n",
      "3631->Very fun tho night sky details don't show up well | 4 | 2 | These unicorns are very fun. I use them to add details over my painted rocks. The night sky designs on them like nebulas did not show up as well as I hoped. I struggled to find the right color backgrounds because I felt that as a night sky they should go on dsrker backgrounds but then they didn't show up.<br /><br />So I put the others on lighter ones and they showed up great but did not really look like night skies. But my friends and neices love the rocks I made with them! So if you just plan on using them as unicorns with interesting color patterns they are great.\n",
      "3641->Horrible Fit/ uncomfortable | 1 | 2 | Was looking forward to this wide headband. Regrettably a total fail. I do admittedly have a smallish head, but have successfully worn and purchased many nice headbands here on Amazon. This one had very off proportions.<br />It was quite oversized. Not just in width ( that was what I was seeking ) but it was quite long from the top of the crown to it's bottom edges. This resulted in it pinching the top of my neck behind my ears, not properly resting on the mound directly behind the ear. Also, the top of the band was very wide so that it did not cradle my crown<br />but it stuck out. There was no way to slide it forward or back to make an adequate fit adjustment. I will also add that the appearance of this band was also a disappointment. It looks great in the photo, like it resembles leather<br />somewhat. In actuality, it looks very plastic and the design is cheap looking. I can't recommend this one at all.\n",
      "3644->Great for daily use- not really permanent | 4 | 2 | I bought this to replace my eyebrow product I was using that was running low. This works great for daily use- the brush is awesome and the color is great!<br /><br />The only reason I gave four stars is because it’s not semi permanent in my experience. It washes off every night when I wash my face. (I’m very fair and have basically invisible eyebrows without this so I can really tell how much is left lol)\n",

Light shedding but feels like real hair! Just stop wasting time and buy it.\n",

      "3676->Warm Soothing Scent | 5 | 2 | Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as \"Azure\" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "3683->Works but not gentle | 3 | 2 | This face mask didnt work like what I see in demonstrations on YouTube.  It work but much more slowly.  It burned<br />around the sides of my nose down by my mouth and after a couple of days made scabby tissue ,it was pretty raw. I guess I have sensitive skin.  I can use it but will avoid this super tender area. It worked to lighten the top of the nose blackheads. I definitely think 2 times a week is the max for using to avoid my issue.\n",
      "3684->UPDATED REVIEW - SELLER CAME THROUGH | 5 | 2 | Seems to work fine, but because the condenser was not included, I can't really tell how it will work when I dry my hair straight.<br />UPDATE: Seller promptly responded and sent me an entire new dryer.  Now that I have condenser, the dryer works great.\n",
      "3687->Great shaver, lousey cover | 4 | 2 | This is a great shaver.  Better shave than my old Norelco, fast recharge, and nearly six weeks of shaving on a charge!!  The plastic cap, however is poor compared to my old ones.  The new ones last only a couple months at best and cost about $9.00 to replace.  (The little retaining tabs break off).  The older style lasted many months and were cheaper to replace.  It looks pretty silly to be traveling with a $150 shaver and have the cap held on by a rubber band!  My fantasy is that some Norelco exec will see me shaving in an airport rest room and ask about it.<br />apstein\n",
      "3692->brown plastic bottles | 4 | 2 | 6-pack value bundle of plastic bottles<br />  Capacity 8 ounces (1 cup) each, height 8 inches, diameter 2 inches<br />  Attractive white plastic lotion pump tops with silver bands<br />  Useful for lotions, shampoos, conditioners, liquid soap, body wash, dish soap & DIY creams or bug repellant<br />  Colored bottle provides UV protection to contents; bottles are #1 BPA free PET plastic (recyclable)<br />I use these for my essentia oil carrier oils.

      "3695->Solid face cream in a tube! | 5 | 2 | First, the solid cream is solid. At first application I tried just putting it on my face directly from the tube and stopped almost immediately because I did not want to tug at my skin. Instead, I did the bar method of application by using my fingers on the top to warm it and then tapped it onto my skin. The next morning I let it sit on my cheek an extra moment and was apply to seamlessly apply with little to no tugging.<br />It's a a balm texture from the tube, but then melts into an almost oil/cream. While I find it takes a little for the oils to fully settle onto the skin once they do, I don't find it to be greasy or heavy.<br />I put this under my SPF in the morning like a serum, and it doesn't pill or bunch up or affect my sunscreen or makeup application after.<br />At night it's just the right amount of moisture to keep my skin happy and balanced. I have not had any break outs. There is no noticeable scent, neither on opening, applying or after wearing.<br />If you are new to solid face creams, serums, etc. give this a little time to find the right balance of how much, how long.<br />The price for the amount is a great value, and I really like the brands ecologically sound stance. I've been a fan of their haircare and am happy to branch out into the skin and face care.\n",

      "3702->Perfect wig for Lucy cosplay | 5 | 2 | I’m so used to ordering wigs from Arda; I was anxious getting one from Amazon. But, my fellow cosplaying peoples- this wig is amazing.<br /><br />My takeaways:<br />-the blonde color is a pretty and more natural blend of yellows. It’s a beautiful color, not crazily oversaturated like some blonde cosplay wigs turn out. It has a very natural vibe.<br />-My picture comes from AFTERa cut and styled it. I should have taken a photo from the get-go but the wig is actually pretty long. The hair fell nearly tiny abdomen and so I had to take about 5-7 inches off. With this wig, I decided to cut it whilst wearing it (rather than put it on a wig head stand) and I used my sharpest pair of scissors to shear it up to where I wanted it. This technique worked PERFECTLY. Since there is already wave in the wig, shearing helped keep the movement and avoided that choppy look you can sometimes get when you lop off length.<br />-ponytail piece is hair attached to a clip. It is incredibly easy to attach to the wig and isn’t incredibly heavy either. I had to take off quite a bit of length on the ponytail piece because it nearly touched my shoulder. I decided not to take it too too short simply because I wanted to ensure the clip kept good coverage and I wanted to make sure there was enough hair to hide the purple bow piece that I made.<br />-the bangs are a perfect length; no crazy eye pokeage and they held really easy after a spritz of hair spray<br />-the wig itself seems sometimes like, “oh no it’s statidlc and maybe tangling” but you can literally just run your fingers through it and it returns to form.<br /><br />This was a great purchase. Really really good quality for the price; highly recommended.\n",

      "3729->Deceptive, and cheap. | 1 | 2 | I am so very disappointed with this product line by Amorepacific. I love their other brands, IOPE and sulwhasoo. But I was in the search for a more affordable toner/emulsion/serum and was excited when they introduced this line and gave a discount. They really sold this beta-hyaluronic whatever that works 1.5x better and I thought it was a new patented technology. But no. Contrary to their marketing claim, there is no such thing as beta hyaluronic acid.  Yes I looked up patent registry and trademark registry and Amorepacific didn’t register anything new in the past few years related to hyaluronic acid. They just put a new spin on beta glucan, which according to some studies works 20% better, not 150% like they claim. Also beta glucan is toward the end of the ingredient list, meaning we have no idea how much of it is even in there. It’s so disappointing that Amorepacific decides to just flat out lie to customers about it. Makes me go wonder what else they are lying about.<br /><br />Now I would not have done all the research if the serum worked well in the first place. But it came with no safety seal which made me go um. The packaging felt cheap. The liquid felt cheap and diluted. My skin smelled like plastic. My skin didn’t stay hydrated like other serums and that’s when I knew something was up. I bought toner, emulsion and serum. The emulsion was sealed but the toner and serum was not. I didn’t even bother trying the emulsion. I’ll be returning these all. I will also be seeking new skincare products that are not made by Amorepacific. Goodbye.\n",

      "3741->Pros & Cons | 2 | 2 | Pros: It warms up and has easy to use settings. It waxes all the hairs you need and easier to use than those other waxers that come in a pot.<br /><br />Cons: It took a very long time for it to heat up. It took around 30-40 minutes to reach 100 degrees which wasn't the max however thats when I took note it takes a very long time for it to heat up. In order to use it, it needs to be plugged in at all times because then it doesn't stay warm.<br /><br />Update: Stopped working after one use. It takes 1 hr to heat up and even then will not fully heat.\n",
      "3746->It's just okay | 2 | 2 | I've used so many color remover products. This one does a good job at lightening a color but has never fully removed the color from my hair. If I simply want to lighten so as to reapply color this will do the trick. If I'm trying to go back to blonde this is not the brand I reach for.<br /><br />As far as the smell it's about the same as all the other color removers I've used. It's not the worst but it definitely has that sulfur scent that will stay in your hair for days (unless you are bleaching after using this product.) As of now it's the price we pay to remove color deposits quickly.<br /><br />I can't say I'd recommend this product but that's just my opinion for my hair. I keep a platinum blonde when I'm not coloring. For someone who has a darker shade this product may be all they need.\n",
      "3750->Confusing 🤔 | 3 | 2 | So - this eyebrow kit arrived and I was pretty excited because it had so much \"stuff\" in it. I wasn't sure what it was all for, so I actually went to read the instructions. The only instructions that came with the kit were on the bag containing the \"purple things\" which said something about using a brush. A brush wasn't included in the kit, or in the description of the product ( in fact, it says that \"no brush is needed\" in the product description.)<br /><br />A this point, I am thinking that perhaps you \"may\" use a brush, but that the kit is really for the eyebrow stamper (which IS included). One side note: I have the \"expensive\" version of the eyebrow stamper kit, and I like it, but none of the eyebrow shapes easily fit my eyebrows, so I was looking for more variety in shapes. Okay, that said, there are tons of eyebrow shapes in this kit. So bonus for that. But back to how to use it and how do the shapes fit in with the purple things?<br /><br />So now I am still trying to wing it, so I put the tiny cord into one of the purple things and think \"maybe\" you slide the eyebrow shapes behind the purple thing. Besides the fact that the cord was SO TIGHT I couldn't think straight, even after 5 minutes of fiddling with the shapes to get them inside the purple thing and lined up, I go to stamp it with the stamper - and no go. The purple things block the stamper rendering the shapes useless.<br /><br />At this point, I go to the internet to search for the solution, and some kind soul had posted a video using the purple things! 🙌🏼 However, she was not using any forms at all - just the purple mask things and a brush and some eyebrow powder to fill in the mask-things.<br /><br />So, I am finally getting that the purple things are something totally unrelated to the eyebrow stamp that I bought the kit for and I go ahead and use the shapes and the stamp just like the more expensive brand. The eyebrow shapes are much, much flimsier than the \"expensive\" brand, which actually might be better. Not better for cleaning, but better for trying to hold in place while you work your other arm around with the stamper.<br /><br />In the end, I thought that the stamper worked just fine, and I liked the variety of shapes which actually enabled me to find a shape closer to my own eyebrows. I'm not a creamy/stick eyeshadow gal, but they were nice colors for those that are. I haven't tried the eyebrow \"soap\" yet either, but I probably will. Heck, I may even try the purple things eventually just to see if it's easier than the stamp. I would definitely have to get a longer cord though 🤕.\n",
      "3752->Amazing product but it could be better | 3 | 2 | The whitening is simply amazing. For me, ever since the first treatment it was very noticeable how much it had whitened.<br /><br />The bad side though, the product itself feels cheaply made. The actual mouth piece is good but the control feels cheaply made, the case as well. Feels like it’s meant to break so that people will buy more.<br /><br />TLDR: amazing whitening but the product itself looks cheaply made excluding the mouth piece\n",

I originally purchased the purple case, and this was my comment at the time:<br /><br />\"I was really happy with the color and quality of the case, but every time I slide my new HP Elitepad into the case, it turns off.  If I pull the tablet out an inch, it turns back on.  But, it will not stay on if it is fully in the case.  Disappointing.\"<br /><br />Someone from the selling company contacted me after posting this, and replaced it with a duplicate black case that does not have this same issue and works great.  I was really impressed that they went out of their way to resolve the issue.  I just figured I was out of my money and the case would go into the trash.  I'm upgrading the review from 1 star to 4 stars just because their customer service surprised me (pleasantly) so much!\n",

      "3795->Does it work well? Kind of!  Will it burn your nipples off? YES! | 3 | 2 | On a hairiness level for my chest, I am a 9 out of 10. My back is a 3 or so. Lathered this on my chest all over the place, moderately thick and had my roommate put it on my back with the popsicle stick applicator (yes, it was weird, but I didn't have a choice).<br /><br />Chest and stomach came out ok after I had already shaved everything down with the Norelco Bodygroomer. The problem is that is may have removed 75% of the stubble, but there was still 25% left and I wasn't going to go through the process again. I have thick, dense hair....e.g. Tom Selleck. My back is like tufts of hair and almost all of this was removed easily. The problem is, unless you have someone hop in the shower with you, how the hell can you reach your back without pulling an arm out of the socket? Regardless, 95% of my back that I could reach, wiped off. We are talking small patches of hair though.<br /><br />The thing that will stop me from using this again on my chest is the fact that it burned my nipples so badly that they were hurting for 2 days. Not particularly fun when you're going on vacation.<br /><br />3 out of 5\n",
      "3799->My wife likes it, but pricey | 3 | 2 | A very light weight oil used as a skin moisturizer (that's what my research on Squalane oil turns up, there's lots of other stuff, but this is the main reliably cited benefit offered). My wife tried this product out, using the entire 1 ounce over a period of about 2 months. She is very positive in her impression, saying that of all the products she has tried, this one seems to have a reliable effect in reduction of micro wrinkles and skin moisturizing. It goes on light and leaves no oily residue.<br /><br />The big issue is that the product is easily 8 times the price of other squalane oils. Given that the single ingredient listed is the oil you have to wonder if the oil is cold pressed by seraphim from plants tended by nymphs. I ordered an alternative product and my wife says that she is satisfied that the new product is good as well. I'll take that as meaning the alternative at a fraction of the cost is effective and a better value for the money.\n",

      "3808->the mask is quite nice, tingley | 4 | 2 | I bought this product because it seems gentle and is cruelty free/vegan. I was shocked to see silk protein in the ingredients list when I got the product, but the company assures me although they are called &#34;silk proteins&#34; on the label, the ingredient is not animal-derived and is comprised of &#34;amino acids developed from plant proteins and carbohydrates&#34; (which I don't think should be called silk then) so I decided to try the mask. One star off for confusing and untrustworthy labeling.<br />That said, the mask is quite nice, tingley, and I had pleasantly soft skin afterward. The mask is gel-like and about the consistency of toothpaste, but goes on clear. I applied toward the end of a bath and left it to dry before rinsing, it dries to a slightly tacky but not tight finish and is relatively easy to rinse off. All and all, I would give it five stars if I didn't wonder slightly about the labeling issue.\n",
      "3813->Easy to Use | 5 | 2 | These vacuum spray bottles are very easy to use. They're especially useful for cosmetic products that contain ingredients that start to degrade when exposed to air. They're ideal for toners, hydrating mists and even essences. They pack well and are leak-resistant. This is a great buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

      "3818->If you want something that's super abrasive, add to cart | 4 | 2 | I love loofahs, washcloths, etc that are super abrasive and exfoliating, but I feel like the ones that I previously used weren't abrasive enough lol. Using this made me feel like a block of parmesan being grated on someone's pasta lol. After using this I felt SO CLEAN and my skin was SO SOFT. I probably buffed away so many layers of dead skin with it so I can't wait for the glow I'm about to get with continued use.<br /><br />The only con I have about it is that it's too damn long. Maybe it's in the description and I glossed over it, but I feel like it was probably 4 feet long lol. I cut it in half, but I didn't realize till I got in the shower after cutting it that it loosened all the little threads (and they got everywhere lol). It was an easy fix- just melt the ends with a lighter after cutting so that the threads don't shed off (or just don't cut it if you like the length of it). With it cut in half, I was still able to hold both sides of it and scrub my back.<br /><br />I'll probably update this regarding how long the abrasiveness holds up (although I may have compromised the integrity by cutting it- oh well)<br /><br />Anyway, happy scrubbing!\n",

      "3828->These hair clips underestimated my power. | 3 | 2 | So, the reviews said this works for thick hair. And it definitely works for what people normally describe as thick hair.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />I have INSANELY thick, wavy, hair with a mind of it's own. I CAN make these work right after I wash and brush my hair, but the process looks nothing like the \"17-second hairstyle!\" videos one may find online.<br /><br />However, it's not the manufacturers' fault that I look like Rapunzel's cousin (whose hair possesses volume instead of length) had a baby with Cousin It. So, for normal people, preferably with straight or wavy hair, this is a great product.\n",
      "3833->Works great for me. | 5 | 2 | There's something about this conditioner that just works for me.  Before this, I've never, ever found a conditioner I like.  Most of them leave my hair heavy;  many of them leave my hair feeling a bit stiff or crunchy.  Often they make my scalp itch as well.  Funny, my hair/scalp isn't as sensitive to shampoos as it is to conditioners.  This shampoo, however, leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother but not weighed down at all.  Actually, when you're rinsing it out, you can still feel that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling; not that greasy feeling you get with other conditioners.  But, it does soften/moisturize the hair.  It's soothing to the scalp as well.  Scent is pleasant but quite subtle.<br /><br />age:  upper 50's<br />hair:  short;  50% gray; natural<br />climate:  dry & hot<br />use of hair product:  minimal<br />use of (heat) styling tools:  no\n",

When using it the 3/4\" long nylon bristles gently touch the scalp while the 1/2\" boar bristles run through my hair and help to smooth it and eliminate static .<br /><br />The brush is about 3 1/4\" by 9 1/2\" with a large brush head of about 3\" by 4 1/2\" that makes quick work of brushing my hair.  The latex base flexes somewhat in use and makes it very comfortable with no scalp irritation.<br /><br />It has a flat lavender colored  handle with a matte finish that helps maintain grip.\n",
      "3848->Lightweight, non greasy moisture | 5 | 2 | The best thing about this serum is that it's completely non greasy. It feels like putting thickened water on your face, but instead of evaporating, it stays on your face and continues to moisturize. I have been using it as a lightweight moisturizer after i wash my face with either an AHA or BHA facewash, so that it really sinks in. That said, it is not enough to use it as a standalone moisturizer, probably exactly because it's non greasy and doesn't create a barrier on your face to keep the moisture in. It says on the bottle to follow up with a moisturizer, and I will but I wanted to test it out alone first.<br />I really like the dropper packaging - you can be very exact about how much serum you're using. I have tried it with different amounts. Today I used only 1/3 of a dropper, and I still feel like it was too much product so next time I will try it will 1/4 dropper. It comes shipped with a screw on cap that you can save and use for travel.<br />I have to say that this really does work. My face feels plump and moisturized with no tight feeling on the surface. It's light enough to put even under my eyes and I don't fear that it will cause millia or clogged pores. I don't have a lot of fine lines yet (36), but my skin is prone to flaking and this takes care of that, all day.<br />It has a very light smell - kind of herbal, but light and inoffensive.<br />I should mention that I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review, and that I have tested and reviewed to the best of my ability.\n",
      "3850->A bit big | 4 | 2 | I have a number of pink ombre wigs. This one is Ok but not my favourite. The top section is mostly dark but it looks more chocolate brown than black (I like black). I like the length of this. The pink sections are very nice and I like the chade of pink. Not salmon but not dusty pink either. The hair has a nice wave to it--nothing too extreme. It's soft but doesn't have that static thing that some wigs have that causes the hair to stick to your arms. '<br />The mocha coloured lace cap is nice and stretchy but it is a tad big for my head. It does have adjustable straps inside. The biggest issue I had with this is the shape of the head section. It's rather dome shaped. I think the cap is overly wide.\n",

      "3863->The clear winner for my hair | 3 | 2 | I have very greasy roots, but I (way) overprocessed my ends.

I have chin length, thick, mostly straight, overprocessed hair.<br /><br />I tried multiple cowashes, and this was finally my ahhh yes! Moment. I love the way this makes my hair feel.

      "3895->Warm Soothing Scent | 5 | 2 | Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as \"Azure\" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included.<br /><br />I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too. These salts seem to inspire sharing and recently inspired a poem:<br /><br />Bubble Bath<br /><br />Turquoise mystery<br /><br />Opalescent bubbles<br /><br />Scent lingers in the air<br /><br />Water splashing over painted toes<br /><br />Sinking into the soothing warm<br /><br />Soul comfort misplaces cares<br /><br />Troubles dissolved<br /><br />Sinking down the drain<br /><br />The wisdom of silence<br /><br />Bliss of Escape<br /><br />Liquid remedy<br /><br />Immersion in solitude<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "3896->Youth Serum | 5 | 2 | One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",

If you have disposable rubber gloves I would use that because it will stain under your nails and have a select toothbrush because it will stain your toothbrush; it will also temporarily stay in your tongue. it doesn't have a strong vanilla or mint flavor, it doesn't taste bad it just doesn't really have a taste to it. from what I read you don't want to use it more than 5 days because it is abrasive to the teeth. So I will definitely be periodically using this.\n",

This set should have included 8pks, consisting of 400 sheets total.

They’re mildly scented, compact, handy and they work to ensure “YOUCLEAN!”\n",
      "3917->Not a \"miracle\" | 2 | 2 | I bought this to treat some winter eczema problems I was having. It was a last-ditch effort before hitting the doctor up for steroid creme. Previously I had tried: coconut oil, vit. E oil, over the counter hydrocortisone cream, and just about anything else I read might help. A friend suggested this. I tried it for one week and it did nothing for my eczema. I also got a bad scratch from my pet during this time, so I tried it on that as well. Nope... still scarred.<br /><br />Honestly, I think Vit. E oil worked better. Save your money and try that instead. This product is worthless and pricy!\n",
      "3924->Color not as bright as photo - but still great! | 4 | 2 | I ordered Kings Blue for a bright summer blue. It's not as bright blue as this photo shows. It took 3 coats to cover the nail & make the polish even looking. It lasted almost a full two weeks with a stamp over it.<br />I would like to try other colors from this brand because I do like the brand.\n",
      "3927->It works, butits oily the smell is... | 2 | 2 | It arrived quickly, slightly leaky.<br />Works as nail polish remover but the stench...<br />It's like a bad, cheap floral-ish smell wrapped in a really caustic chemical smell.<br />It also leaves my hands and everything I touch slightly oily.<br />I can barely stand it, won't return it because it a removes polish, but will never buy or recommend again.<br />EDIT: I've only used about 2/3 of the bottle and I'm trashing it, I just cant with this stuff.\n",
      "3946->Broken at first use | 2 | 2 | Broke on first use .....<br />I put 2 stars because it scrubs pretty well.<br />I would have put 5 if it didn't break right away.\n",
      "3950->Im going back to using Coconut Oil!! | 3 | 2 | I read all the reviews and it sounded like a Miracle Hair Mask. I need a miracle hair mask for my ends. They are really dry due to having a perm and color treated hair.  I have used all but 1/4 of the entire jar. And am not seeing that much of an improvement.<br />I put it on before bed and sleep with it in my hair all night and wash it out in the a.m. I put in on 1 hr before I wash my hair. I have tried it all.<br />I am going back to using my coconut oil!!\n",
      "3957->Smells great!  If it only lasted beyond a few hours.... | 3 | 2 | I consider myself to be a cologne snob.  I like good cologne and I am not afraid to spend good money for it.<br /><br />So, when I see something like Intense Energy available for about a quarter less in price than what most good colognes cost, I become a bit suspicious as to its shortcomings.<br /><br />This fragrance is inspired by Polo Red Cologne.  I am familiar with Polo (I used to wear it in the 80s), and the aroma does have hints of that brand's scent.  It smells pretty good.  It's not overpowering.<br /><br />The problem is, it just doesn't last.  I put on a hefty dose of 4 sprays across my neck and clothing.  The scent had faded within an hour or two.  By the end of an 8 hour workday, I couldn't even smell the scent on my clothing, or when I rubbed my finger across my neck.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a cologne geared more towards affordability than lasting scent.  If you don't mind carrying it with you all day and re-applying it when needed, it won't be a bad purchase decision.\n",
      "3959->No mo stank | 5 | 2 | What can I say? No mo sting either for my intensely pruritic post menopausal lichen sclerosis lady parts. Trying to avoid colorful language here. But maintaining proper pH for the cooter goes a long way toward preventing UTIs. And the wipes are good for post coital freshening up. You’re supposed to pee after sex to avoid retrograde bladder infections, ya know. Just don’t throw wipe down the toilet.<br /><br />But here’s more food for thought. We paid $600 to have soap scum removed from grout, tile and glass shower doors. The person said no more bar soap, leaves a residue, body wash only. So I moved to guest bathroom and use this stuff and liquid soaps only. No more supporting local goat’s  milk alkali soap artisans. My shower stall is pristine, husband’s shower is returning to its previous condition.\n",
      "3970->Great Choice for Carrier Oil | 5 | 2 | As always...this is a fave carrier oil for me as far as pain goes.  I've  incorporated it into several of my products I make (mostly pain cremes/salves).<br />I would not hesitate to purchase again.\n",
      "3977->Will do the job | 5 | 2 | First off, the wig is definitely not like the picture advertised. Its not full and definitely not a full 16 inches.  But it doesn't shed and the hair is soft and light weight. Other than that I have no real complaints about it. As someone who is recovering from chemo, this wig makes me feel a little more confident for the time being.<br /><br />****<br />I have to give an update to this order. After my honest review of the product,  the seller was actually kind enough to reach out to me and offer me secondary choices in order to better accommodate my dissatisfaction of my wig. I am beyond pleased with the professionalism and great customer service of this particular company. Im changing my review to 5 stars simply based off the fact that they are so eager to please their customers.<br />Thank you\n",
      "3981->NO Fragrance and NO reply from Customer Service | 1 | 2 | So, I ordered this because I love the fragrance of lilac.<br />I started using it, and the box smelled lovely, but the was NO fragrance to the soap.<br />So, I decided to look at the ingredients and there is not ONE ingredient that says lilac oil, or anything lilac or violet.<br />The only thing even close just said \"fragrance\" without describing it.<br />Well, I wanted to give this company a chance to explain, because perhaps there is an ingredient there that actually has lilac in it, so I wrote to them.<br />No response after 2 weeks. Then I tried again. It's been 10 days and no response.<br />Naturally I will never buy anything from this company again because:<br />1. They are misleading the customer with their false labeling and:<br />2. They did not have the courtesy, nor did they care to respond to a customer concern.\n",
      "3983->no go | 1 | 2 | I tried two pair of fresh batteries, from different packages.<br /><br />No go.<br /><br />Contrast this with my similar model from Oil of Olay. It didn't come with extra brushes or a plastic case and two boxes bound for the landfill.  Yet, it has run for years. Despite dropping it in the shower a couple of times.  And it was half the price of this $60 version.<br /><br />If it starts off this bad, I would not want to risk what it would do a month or two down the road.\n",
      "3993->Good Enough | 3 | 2 | It keeps light out as it's supposed to do, but the strap really cuts into the top of the ear and it's a little awkward to sleep with the strap above/pressed up against your ears. The velcro is really sharp, so when I loosen the velcro strap, the &#34;barbs&#34; of the velcro tear at my pillow, damaging the fabric. So I have to sleep with these with the mask on really tight to prevent the velcro-barbs from damaging the pillows. I've tried putting tape over it but it falls off because I toss-and-turn a lot.<br />Aside from all that discomfort stuff, it works and it's good enough for now.\n",
      "4001->Doesn't seem to quite match MAC NC35 | 2 | 2 | My wife ordered this. Here is her review:<br />I have dry sensitive skin and usually wear MAC shade NC35. I was so hoping this would match, since most Korean cushions are too light for me. It seemed to match when applied in a thin layer on my chin, but once I applied it all over my face, it was clearly too yellow (I've also tried the Missha cushion and that was too orange). It is full coverage so I would recommend applying a very thin layer first and then building from there. I wore it without primer because I wanted to see what the coverage and finish was like. It breaks up after several hours and will start to emphasize dry spots. Disappointed because I really wanted it to work, but giving it two stars because it's definitely full coverage, the packaging is very attractive and it arrived quickly.\n",
      "4006->Decent Shaver.. | 3 | 2 | Had the shaver for a couple of weeks now.<br /><br />It is cheap and it shaves. Not the greatest, but gets me by work.<br /><br />It irritated my skin but has gotten a little better. I'm just going to keep it instead of wasting my time sending it back. Luckily, I'm using 2 shavers, different locations for convenience purposes, and will use this as a secondary shaver.<br /><br />I'd recommend getting the model slightly higher than this at $49.99, 7140 I think with the \"Patented Reflex Action Shaving System: automatically adjusts to every curve on your face for flexible, smoother shaving\". This is for people with sensitive skin.\n",
      "4007->First use - Not please | 2 | 2 | This is the first electric razor I have used in almost 30 years.  So my comments below may be slanted<br /><br />1.  Right out of the box the razor was fully charged<br /><br />2.  I had about 2-3 days worth of growth (I do not have a heavy growth beard)<br /><br />3.  My first impression was the razor pulled more than it cut.  I cant imagine its going to get better<br /><br />So with that I am very disappointed\n",
      "4010->Very helpful for plucking eyebrows and seeking imperfections in your skin! | 4 | 2 | I ordered this Hampstead Home Vanity Mirror because when I'm getting ready for 'date night' with the hubby, I like to take my time putting on my face (applying my makeup).  That usually means I'm sitting down and listening to the TV while trying to make sure my makeup is as flawless as possible.  It helps tremendously to have a lighted mirror that has magnification so that I can make sure that my eyebrows are properly groomed and that I've managed to hide / blend any and all imperfections in my skin tone.  On the flip side, you ONLY get the magnification with this mirror so if you want the overall effect, you better stand WAY back or go to another mirror.<br /><br />In order to utilize the lighted feature of this mirror, you need to install 3 AA batteries (not included).  The lighting is pretty awesome though and much better than the lighting I've experienced with another type of mirror.  The suction cup is a nice feature, although not one that I personally need to use.  This isn't a mirror that I will leave on my countertop and it's a very stable mirror so I don't see the need to suction it down.  I think the price of this mirror is very reasonable and I've paid more than this for similar products.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Whether I get a product for free, at a discount or pay full retail price, I am 100% committed to my reviews reflecting my genuine thoughts. I appreciate you taking the time to read my review and hope that it was helpful with determining if this is the right product for you!\n",
      "4015->Another winner from Majestic Pure | 5 | 2 | I have many Majestic Pure products (from skin care products, to hair care, to essential oils), and have always been very satisfied. I am also pleased with the retinol cream. Having very sensitive skin, I tend to use products containing retinol quite sparingly (aka, every few days, vs. daily) as they tend to cause my skin to become quite irritated or scaly after a few days of daily use. I’ve been using this around just my eyes every evening (about 1 hour after applying a hyaluronic acid serum), as my skin is so sensitive that using anything with retinol on my entire face seems to really cause a lot of scaliness. And, this is where the fine lines are really beginning to show.<br /><br />The results – after using a cream with retinol in combination with hyaluronic acid serum for 3 weeks, I’ve been noticing a definite reduction in the fine lines. They are still there but they were becoming really noticeable.<br /><br />The cream has ingredients that are highly moisturizing (again, which I like to follow up on a serum with). The consistency is pretty thin (not thick and creamy like a lotion), and there is no noticeable fragrance. It seems to absorb quickly and is not oily.<br /><br />Some note on the ingredients:<br /><br />Retinol 2.5% - Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant (helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals, apparent in wrinkles and aging), encourages the production of collagen, and elastin.<br />Jojoba Oil - closely resembles sebum (a waxy substance produced by our skin glands), packed with vitamins and minerals - Vitamin E, B, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine and chromium.<br />Green Tea - Tea is high in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, whether ingested or applied topically. Green tea contains tannins which can reduce puffiness and inflammation of the skin. It also contains polyphenols, which can combat free radicals (which contribute to aging). The catechins in tea can combat the bacteria that contribute to acne.<br />Propolis - Propolis, “bee glue or bee penicillin” is the resinous material gathered by honeybees from flowers and leaf buds of various plants. It contains dozens of anti-oxidants,<br />Shea Butter - The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to those produced by the skin’s sebaceous glands, making it one of the best choices for super-dry or cracked skin. Shea butter also contains anti-inflammatory compounds – great for applying to inflamed or irritated skin (think eczema, chapped skin, bug bites)<br />Vitamin B5 - A humectant (a water-binding substance that attracts and retains water). Particularly good for the skin as it stabilizes the skin barrier, increasing hydration and improving softness and elasticity.<br />Vitamin E - A powerful antioxidant, that neutralizes the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles<br /><br />*I received the retinol cream for evaluation and review\n",
      "4017->One or the other, not both! | 3 | 2 | I ordered this shampoo and conditioner bundle because I love this brand. When I received my package today, the only thing I received was the conditioner. The shampoo wasn't even there. I called customer service to let them know, but since it was supposed to be a bundle, there isn't much that can be done about it besides getting a refund. 🙄<br /><br />I'm only giving 3 stars because I was expecting both to be in the package, not one or the other.<br /><br />The lady I spoke to said that there's a possibility the shampoo could come at a different day, but not sure why since, again, it was supposed to be a bundle.  She said that I can wait until Monday at 8am to see if I get it or not, if not is to reorder again.<br /><br />This is the one and only time I've ever had any issues like this. I just hope that when I reorder, that I ACTUALLY get both this time!\n",
      "4019->Great | 5 | 2 | I have a cosmetology license but I am also frugal. Purchased this to apply my own eyelash extensions and it worked great. I will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I do not recommend applying it to yourself though. It is difficult and you can damage your eyelashes if done incorrectly. The glue also burns your eyeballs.\n",
      "4024->Not what I expected | 2 | 2 | I read an article about this product being used with a tint & over primer as an exceptional solution for textured skin. Did not work for me. Other reviews stated it was shiny & it is. In a way that makes me look like a grease ball. Texture was not in the least covered.<br />This might work better for other skin types.\n",
      "4029->Smell like the man you can smell faaaaaar away | 3 | 2 | I cave, suckered, bought in to the commercial because I expected to find myself on a horse smelling like the man a man wants to something something.  It smells fine, a bit too strong, and I learned I'm more a fan of the clear sticks rather than white powdery chalky stuff.<br /><br />Now I just smell like the man you can smell a block away.\n",
      "4030->Looks great - even on short nails! | 5 | 2 | These nail polish appliques look great - even on short nails! I don't know if the pictures actually do them justice, but they're very sparkly and look like 'real' nail polish.<br /><br />They're extremely easy to apply but are very stretchy and can tear easily, if you don't take your time. Just be careful when you apply them. Once in place, I smoothed the polish strip down with my thumb and then gently slid a soft tipped orange stick over it to make sure that all the air bubbles were out and that the polish strip was securely in place. The package also includes a mini nail file so that you can file off the excess and get into the corners of your nails, which may be hard to do with a larger nail file. The instructions on how to apply them were clear and it took me about 10-15 minutes to put them on.<br /><br />It's been about a week and they still look great!\n",
      "4046->Cheap price,  heap quality | 2 | 2 | BUY The numbers from Elenco instead. THEY are soldered and used better wire.<br /><br />These are the standard, crappy crimped cheap clip cables you can find in the junk bin in any electronics store. If that's what you want, you will be happy.  These also feature a slippery silicon like  clip insulator that is hard to grip and slides back to expose the clips, and let them short out against each other.  Pay no attention to the glowing review above about decent sized conductors no soldered connections. That add was either for some other product or written by the sellers mother.\n",
      "4053->snake oil | 1 | 2 | Historically used as a cure-all or panacea, however there are no proven pharmacological effects of Willard Water. In the past, it has been used as an industrial cleanser. The FDA does not recognize Willard Water as safe or effective.<br /><br />From [...]\n",
      "4059->Great soap | 5 | 2 | Great soap from a great company. Note that these bars are about half the size of what the company usually makes... which is why you get twice the bars for the same price.<br /><br />Some people complained the smell isn’t very strong but half the reason I buy more natural soap is to get away from fragrances so I like that.\n",
      "4060->Not the best quality | 1 | 2 | Super disappointed that the stud of the earring kept turning and wouldn’t stay securely in. Needless to say after two days wearing earring it fell out and got lost.<br />Too much of a hassle to return. Wont recommend.\n",
      "4062->Decent for it's price point. | 5 | 2 | [[VIDEOID:5e37579b01c9e26d7c0d83a26f8153a7]] *as a licensed cosmetologist, I'm reviewing this item from a personal as well as professional standpoint*<br /><br />I am almost 30 years old, and still suffer from breakouts. I have seen dermatologist and tried a lot of things but they often dry out my skin too much, causing my skin to produce MORE sebum (oil) combining with the  medicines side effect of dry dead skin sells. This is a fast way to disaster skin-wise and often causes my skin to worsen. Because of this, I have tried many different facial cleansing devices, and here are the points that I like about this one.<br /><br />1) Rechargable! Nothing is worse than needing to use a facial scrubber only to find that the batteries are dead. I cannot tell you how many times that the batteries have died (in other models) and then to make it worse, I often discover a mess of rust when I open up the compartment to change the batteries. The fact that this unit can be easily charged through a micro USB is not only convenient but also costs less and is safer.<br /><br />2) Variety- all the different attachments that come with this unit is a nice little bonus. I can't genuinely say that I would use all of them (remember, trained in skin Haha) but as a consumer I still appreciate the additional options.<br /><br />3) Quality- at this price point, it's surprisingly well made. I was a little concerned with the rubber cap that protects the USB port, but other than that, it's sturdy. The plastic does not flex at all, and it feels solid.<br /><br />4) Sound- I never thought that something like sound would bother me, but I definitely noticed how quiet this unit is compared to other models I've owned. I have two small children, so I'd often have to go to a bathroom further away from their bedrooms to cleanse my face at night, but with the noise level of this cleaner, i'm just genuinely not concerned with waking them.<br /><br />The only 'con' that I've found personally is the speed of rotation vs the softness of the bristles. I feel like it would be more productive to either have the head rotate faster or have harder bristles. Having said that, skin is very thin, especially when it's sensitive like mine. I DO prefer the softer bristles, because they are much kinder to my skin and I don't have to worry about causing more damage to inflamed areas. However, the brush's rotation was just too slow for me, (please see my review video for a short view of the rotation)  and I felt impatient at how long it took to get a thorough round of cleansing and sloughing to my face. Because of this, I cannot rate at 5 stars because it's just simply not as good as it could be. But, all things considered it's still a good sturdy competitor at its price point in today's market.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review. I strive to provide fellow consumers with the most detailed, unbiased and (hopefully) helpful reviews that I can, believing that allowing a discount to influence a review is a disservice to other shoppers. Therefore, anything contained in this review can be considered my own independent and unbiased thoughts and opinions, that have not been influenced in any way.\n",
      "4076->Flower very nice, but birdcage veil difficult to handle | 4 | 2 | I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a \"fascinator\" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.\n",
      "4080->Two Powerful Ingredients | 5 | 2 | If you're over 35, this serum is a must. It contains two powerful skin-saving ingredients. Vitamin C keeps skin bright and radiant. It protects skin from UV damage. It boosts collagen production and helps fade dark spots quickly. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin draw moisture from the environment. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's hard to find a high quality organic serum like this. I highly recommend this serum and the brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "4089->Outdoors? More like damp office supplies. | 2 | 2 | I have bought almost every other oil from 'The 2 Bits Man' and this is by far the worst one. I read reviews on this one like 'It smells like burnt wood' or 'The Canoeist beard oil smells like birch and cedar'. Either you guys are paying people to write reviews, or I received a bad bottle of oil. I guess it could be that my wife and I have a different sense of smell than everyone else? We both agree that it literally smells like damp cardboard. If you take the box it came in, soak it in water, tear it, then smell where you tore it, that's what it smells like.<br /><br />Being from the south, I know what &#34;burnt wood&#34; and or &#34;cedar&#34; smell like... it isn't even close. I guess I could smell the birch... but it smells like wet, old birch firewood that has been sitting outside for a good while.<br /><br />The ONLY reason why I gave it two stars is because its better than the unscented jojoba oils you can buy. Also, the outside of the bottle was completely soaked with oil when I got it. I assume this was from being on a plane with the pressure changes that caused some of the oil to seep out and get all over it. The cap was kind of crooked under the seal so maybe that was why?\n",
      "4097->Different yes, I use it daily :) | 5 | 2 | With cosmetics online it's difficult if you haven't seen the product first hand,choosing colors.<br /><br />I swore I ordered a different color set than I received on this order. I haven't seen this Trio in store before.<br />The colors that I received, are a buff ivory (semi sheer) a taupe center (that I love) than is the bronzer which has orange undertones.<br /><br />At first I cringed at the orange of the bronzer. Yet once applied they all blend well. It's a Fall / Winter combo for me.<br />I am enjoying the buff and taupe, very different from any blush, contour, this is new tones/colors compared to what I've used in the past.<br />A very natural effect. I have always been a fan of Physicans Formula. I am using it daily.\n",

      "4107->I'm not seeing it | 2 | 2 | These are essentially giant temporary tattoos very similar to the ones you sometimes get as novelty gifts and promotional material.<br />Like those, you simply peel off the protective cover, press the design where you want it, then wet the back of the paper holding the tattoo, until it transfers to your skin.<br />Rubbing alcohol helps wipe the tattoo off, if wear and tear and sweat don't take it out first.<br /><br />The reasons I personally did not care for these:<br />- A lot less vivid on my skin, than in photos or against the paper<br />- There is no precut opening for your mouth; FYI, you get the best result cutting (carefully) an opening after you put the tattoo on, not before<br />- Very difficult to line up with your own mouth<br />- If you wear these over your mouth, the activity of talking, drinking, eating, etc... rapidly degrades the tattoo, causing wrinkles, gaps, tears, etc...<br /><br />In my opinion, the best use of these temporary tattoos would be to create the illusion of a fake mouth somewhere else on you body, like your tummy, neck, back, hand, etc...<br />Honestly, I was just really disappointed with these all around.\n",
      "4109->Itching, pain increased from air pollution. Cant  use. | 3 | 2 | The information on the pamphlet that came with the eye drops was interesting; it stated one ingredient keeps the eye moist, it is naturally found in the eye, body. Another ingredient is a vitamin that doctors use to help the cornea... heal.<br />So I figured these might be good for pollen, mold exposure allergy increased by airplane fumes (low flying jets that go to the airport over my apartment.) and 2 other chemicals in our air; neighbors e-cigarette and drug pipe vaping fumes and laundry mat constant white cloud blowing out into the air, into our apartments; bleach, chemical soaps...<br /><br />Many of my neighbors have the same uncomfortable feeling. Increased in spring, late fall by certain pollens. We live next to a marsh.<br /><br />I been taught by natural eye doctors to avoid eye drops. But; for the first time in my life I thought I might try these until my eyes, nose get used to the air here (if that is possible), or I am able to move.<br /><br />The drops felt nice the first night; but next day I had extreme dry eyes, dizzyish, crawly kind of feeling in head, sinus. Then much itching! I was walking to the store and on the way sniffled. The itching seemed to spread from the eyes tear drainage system into the nose and up into the sinus by the nose/eyes and forehead. Awful strange, strong itching.<br />Next day (I never took the drops again, have thrown them away); the eyes are very soar and sinus has extreme pressure, crawling feeling and pain. I think the eye drops caused the pollen, mold, chemicals to flow through from the eye-tear drainage tube into the nose, then up the sinus when I was sniffling in the rain yesterday. Today pain still bad but itching less. Following day two; no drops for 3rd day; pain, itching less. Pain gone after days no eye drops. Went  back to using humidifier.<br /><br />Maybe the drops are good for other conditions a doctor might apply for. I do not know. I definitely have decided to go back to my usual use of a steam humidifier, natural food, natural methods, natural medical and eye, nutrition doctors advice. And to keep looking a for a better place to live. After 2 moves in last 3 years; I think this time I know how to avoid a bad real estate deal.<br /><br />Eye doctor, driving test recently says eyes, eyesight is very good. But got allergy to whatever is in the air. And the air’s chemicals can cause dry eyes.<br /><br />These eye drops definitely do not work in certain situations, and can make a eye, sinus pollen, mold.., allergy... worse.\n",
      "4113->Decent for the price | 4 | 2 | I read the date on this incorrectly and thought it was expired originally (I’m in USA and blonde, if that tells you anything lol) & realized it’s international date format... with the year first! Lol<br />I used this today, it’s okay but doesn’t look extremely natural on my skin tone, unfortunately. It seems to stay on if your face gets a little wet, but can be removed with makeup remover.\n",
      "4115->I can finally say kiss my a** and be prepared if the opportunity presents itself | 4 | 2 | Staring with the basics.....the packaging was just as pictured above. Very colorful as well as sturdy. The material was made out of thicker plastic. With almost a matte finish to the touch. I know some of you guys are like &#34;really girl? Is it that serious?&#34; Hey, I'm just leaving details I would want to know.<br />  The product itself delivered on its promise. Left me feeling smooth and silky as ever. Also it organic. That's pretty fantastic, at least for the folks who worry about that stuff. Oh, and I forgot, it's not tested on animals. Another goodie.<br />  Back to the product, it's a thicker consistency than I was expecting. Which turned out to be a good thing. The scrub didn't disapate as quickly as other scrubs I've tried in the past. Which meant even more lather time to really scrub away the troubles of working in freaking customer service all day.<br />  The only con I have is that they could have had more in the packaging. Just like your favorite bag of chips, contained air at the top. But all in all it's still a good investment.\n",
      "4116->Heavy Sweaters may need both Deodorant and Antiperspirant | 4 | 2 | Product was easy to use but read directions.<br />The Antiperspirant was Great in Roll On, the Breast Application was Ok because I need one for my Face and Head, otherwise, the Sweat kept pouring. This is not a cure all, especially after a heavy workout out or a hard walk in the Sun. I am giving it a Month to perhaps see the best effects and even if it helps to lessen the Severity, I'll take it!!\n",
      "4128->mostly satisfied - has common design flaws | 3 | 2 | this is not the 'model' I received.  I received the version with 1 large compartment on the front (as opposed to the pictured 2 compartments).  I was packing for a job, and wanted to use right away so I did not contact seller to see about an exchange.<br /><br />as usual, whoever makes stylist's bags does not seem to test the spaces with actual tools inside, fully loaded - as most stylist would use it.  the right side has a heat resistant pocket for hot tools.  it fits my flat iron & a standard length curling iron (mine must be long as it sticks out the top).  difficult to use with tools still hot as the cords really have no space other than inside this pocket.  there are envelope slots in the 'door' of this compartment.  I have tried to fit a brush ... but it quickly becomes too bulky and difficult to zipper shut.<br /><br />I use zucca cases inside the main compartment which work fine.  I specifically ordered this because it was soft-sided ... but that means when fully loaded, it collapses easily and I really watch how I set it up.  also, as I am using it with zucca bags (as opposed to the boxes shown) - getting into just one bag at a time is difficult since they rely on being stacked just so.  my zucca bags do not protrude out of the compartment, but fit snuggly in which, again, becomes a problem when using the pockets & accompanying bags that are in this front 'door'.  I usually have to lay the bag back to get it zipped close (like the 80's - laying on the bed to zipper your pants!! C-:  )<br /><br />it seems sturdy enough; the proportions of the backpack aspect are good and I really like the heavy duty top handle.  time will tell ... my zucca case started coming apart at the seams after just 1 year.  hoping this one is better reinforced\n",
      "4134->It's a keeper | 3 | 2 | This little unit has the power all right-it felt like needles hitting my gums.  I used the soft setting and it was painful.  Also, the water tank ran out in less than 15 seconds so I had to refill three times for the first use.  I will try it again and hopefully, it won't hurt.  Otherwise, it may be returned to the company.  Oh, and it arrived in an envelope, not a box.  The  inner box was a bit squished.  No other apparent problems, though.<br />After using this little unit for a couple of weeks, I have decided I like it after all. You do have to refill it a couple of times if you are like me and take your time. It has kept its initial charge from the second day I had it for at least 2 weeks now, without recharging! Very powerful-almost too strong for me at first, but I adjusted to it.<br />It is made in China-which I would prefer an American made product but this is what I could afford.  It seems sturdy enough and definitely powerful enough to do a good job.\n",
      "4139->Goopy texture, difficult to wash off, minimally hydrating | 2 | 2 | Goopy texture, difficult to wash off, minimally hydrating<br /><br />This product look whitish out of the tube, but goes on clear, and dries clear and a bit shiny on the face.<br /><br />It feels tingly when you put it on and then when it's dry, it feels a little tight.<br /><br />When you try to wash it off, it takes many, many washes over and over to get it off of your face.<br /><br />The result is a little bit of hydration for alot of work getting it off.  Also, I don't love the smell.<br /><br />Smell - thumbs down<br />texture - big thumbs down<br />time effort - thumbs down<br />hydration - minimal\n",
      "4142->Great for adult acne issues | 5 | 2 | When I first tried this product, I had also changed several other aspects of my skin care regiment. All of that amounted to a huge improvement in my skin. Like an idiot, when I ran out of the niacin mist, I opted not to reorder because I could not say for certain it made a difference. Within a week I regretted it. I struggle with adult acne and I absolutely feel like this product helps to balance my skin and reduce breakouts. I apply once a day (usually in the morning) right before I apply my moisturizer. I make sure to not let it dry before moisturizing so everything gets spread around evenly. I don't know where I picked that method up from but it seems to do the trick so I go with it.<br /><br />Also, the bottle lasts quite awhile and compared to how much my other skin treatments cost, it is a steal. I highly recommend giving it a go.\n",
      "4148->I’ll get used to it eventually 💁🏻‍♀️💡 | 4 | 2 | It’s really nice to try new (and sometimes improved) products and see good results quickly. Did have some issues at first, but 3+ sticky situations lol, I’m almost near amazing improvement.<br />At first being that we are dealing with hot wax, be very careful. Where it lands, it stays! With that said, I was not confident on temperature. Still working on that, but I like this thing!!!😍<br />I really don’t think I’ll try anything else for a while. Great product!\n",
      "4155->It does work, but I bought it for a specific dryer/attachment at it couldn’t hold the weight. | 3 | 2 | I really wanted to love this. I have a Dyson dryer, which I live, but I had an orchid diffuser in the past that was AMAZING. However, there’s only one dryer an orchid diffuser fits on and i went through 2 of them in a year (the first one just died and the second one started SPARKING IN MY HAIR!). I saw videos on how the SnozzlePro could connect an orchid to a dyson and I was all in. It works. It does connect the two, but it is so heavy that the magnetic connection between the attachment you put the SnozzlePro on with the orchid diffuser cannot stay connected to the dryer. I spent the whole time trying to hold the attachment to the dryer, and when I couldn’t it was pop off and blow fast hair into my damp curls which creates a ton of frizz.<br /><br />I think I can still dig it to work, and it does what it says: creates a connection point for attachments, but it isn’t perfect and I don’t know if a tube of silicone is worth the price.\n",
      "4156->Very soft very comfortable but sheds a bit | 3 | 2 | Rare miss from haircube. I've bought wigs from this seller and there's usually a standard amount of expected wig shedding but this one was a little too much.<br />Otherwise wig is soft and well styled and looks cute.\n",
      "4160->Awesome | 5 | 2 | I purchased these to use in my traveler's notebook. I make ink backgrounds, and these work marvelously.  These arrived quickly, were well packaged and also came inside a really thick drawstring bag. They also give you a little surprise...and who doesn't love surprises?!? 🙃<br />The same style of blenders touted to crafters are three or more times the cost...save your money and grab these instead. The ink rinses right out plus I am using less ink than I did with the traditional foam blenders.\n",
      "4163->works well | 4 | 2 | It didn't seem to work too well the first time. I applied it for ten minutes and only about 15% of my hair came off. However, I have very thick, somewhat matted pubis. Then an hour later I tried again but put a little water in the area and used a lot more balm(probably half a bottle), and waited fifteen minutes instead of ten (including on testicles). I also put some around my anus.<br /><br />This time 98% of my remaining hair was removed. I was also able to pluck some out with almost no pain.<br /><br />My anus burned pretty badly even after putting on the soothing lotion. However, an hour later my anus is healed and I never had any burning at all on my private area. I'm going to try again in a little while to remove the remaining hair!\n",
      "4164->Disappointingly causes acne | 2 | 2 | Not a fan. A Korean YTer I follow has gorgeous skin but a really basic skincare routine. For makeup, she used this BB. She looks amazing so I thought I’d try it too and maybe cut down my own routine.<br />I used this over the glow primer(which broke me out horribly)and I think this also contributed to my breaking out. It has an odd texture too. It’s very thick but you can melt it into your skin—yet somehow it doesn’t entirely blend in...hope that makes sense. No matter how you use it, it’s still visible on your skin and u can see it gets patchy. A heavy layer simply doesn’t blend and looks and feels like obvious pudding on your face. Light layers blend but cling randomly and don’t blend out. It’s so odd bc it feels smooth and creamy out of the tube.<br />This is also heavily fragranced. This and the glowy primer are both very heavy, greasy and fragranced. My skin broke out in millia, comedomes and cysts. Plus it’s been super irritated to the point I stopped using makeup totally and just did basic repairing skincare. It’s been about 3 weeks getting my skin to calm down. As much as I would love to say it’s a great product (great shade and convenient packaging for ease of use) it’s terribly skin unfriendly.<br />Def won’t be using this or the cc glowy primer again.\n",
      "4169->Super cute! | 4 | 2 | The water decals are very fine/delicate. I was as genital as I know how to be. Still lost some so order two sets.<br />Although if you are looking for something like this design it is hard to fine.<br />Did the best I could.<br />I would order again if needed.\n",
      "4178->Expired? | 1 | 2 | Item just arrived today, date of manufacture is said to be Dec 2017 (more than 3 years ago), with a general shelf life of 36 months, so in other words, I basically got an expired item(?)<br /><br />Haven't tried it yet, cause I decided to come and write this review.\n",
      "4186->Natural looking wig | 4 | 2 | I have a few wigs and this one is my favorite so far.  The wig is actually a little darker than I thought it would be but the color is not too bad.  After I received the wig and combed it, I loved how natural it looked!  The part in the wig looks real and there is just enough shine that looks natural but doesn’t overdo or look “fake”.<br />I’m very pleased with how expensive and real this wig looks.\n",
      "4187->Luxury Obsidian Facial Roller | 1 | 2 | Don't waste your money on this!!! Buy a plain obsidian crystal for 1/3 the price & it will look and feel much better.<br />It does NOT roll like a roller!!! It doesn't even look like something I would display on my counter!<br />It was poorly wrapped also! the paper box it came in was all crushed up.\n",
      "4193->Could be better, but its doable | 3 | 2 | cons<br />-No natural hairline, hairline is quite harsh<br />-hair is quite brassy in color<br />-wish the color would fade into blonde a little bit better<br /><br />pros<br />-thick hair<br />- feels soft<br />-no shedding so far\n",
      "4194->Formaldehyde?! Not safe. 2 Stars ⭐ | 2 | 2 | After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I \"might\" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!\n",
      "4224->BEAUTIFUL! | 5 | 2 | WOWWW!! Why didn't I buy this months ago?! This is by far the prettiest, and now my favourite, out of my 4 wigs! I think I'll be buying several more of these so I'll never be without one! It's not shiny at all, very real looking. Is soft enough to feel like real hair. Will probably get matted at least slightly-moderately while wearing since ALL synthetic wigs do, so keep a pick in your purse and keep the unit conditioned with an appropriate wig spray or maybe a little silicone-based leave-in hair gloss, like Biosilk. Wig experts or YouTube videos can advise you on this best.<br /><br />Running my fingers through it right out of the package, to detangle and fluff it, I noticed there was absolutely no shedding. When combing it, there was no shedding. I was quite shocked. My other blonde wig from Kryssma sheds LIKE CRAZY and already has huge bald spots in it after brushing it only 5 or 6 times since purchase.<br /><br />I hope this wig won't be the same!!! To try to ensure against it, and because this wig is so much curlier, I'll try to only finger comb it.\n",
      "4232->This is my very long hair's best friend! I have no explanation | 5 | 2 | This is my very long hair's best friend! I have no explanation, nor will I attempt to explain how the design and dynamics of this nifty tool works. One thing I can say is that it detangles my waist length hair like nothing else! Using ordinary combs can be extremely challenging for women with long hair like myself. I experienced a lot less instances of hair fall, because this detangling brush separates the knots and tangled bits of my hair more efficiently. A &#34;must have tool&#34; for women, regardless of how long or short their hair is!<br /><br />As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes.

      "4234->Wish bottle was larger. Effective but serious chemical gel polish remover | 4 | 2 | High quality tools with this remover. I really only needed the removed though. Would have preferred a larger bottle instead of the tools. This stuff is super effective at removing gel nails however the bottle only has enough to remove 2 full sets of nails. By the third time I used it I was only able to apply thin coats which was far less effective and more time consuming and still had to pull off nails which I hate to do. I don't know if there is another method or product for removing gel nails. As crazy as this stuff is I can't imagine an alternative. Getting even a tiny bit any where on your skin or clothes and your going to feel it! I treated it like wet nail polish the first and was just careful. Now I'm sure to use the rest room first make sure I'm not gonna be changing the channel on the TV or moving at all! I threw on my coat n took the dog for a walk. Bad decsion. My clothes were fine and so was I really. Once i washed it off I was totally fine but that stinging sensation is extremely unpleasant. The remover reminds me of putting hydrogen peroxide on an open wound. The way you see the white fizzies. Only if it was a giant glob consuming your gel nail. Leaving on a thick layer for 15 or 20 min I was able to completely wipe away my gel nail. When i was less patient I'd wipe and apply more every 3 to 5 min and had to clean up my nails a little after. Instructions do say to use a file to rough up nail surface first which I did not do this time but does make it faster<br />First pic of my nail (gel polish over clear tips using solid nail tips gel and uv light to attach them instead of nail glue) is before remover<br />Second pic is one coat of remover about 5 seconds after application<br />Third pic is second extremly thick coat probably third and fourth coat also. Applied right over first one a few seconds after application<br />Forth is about a minute or two later with no additional application. It looks so gross but it is stuff just consuming my false nail<br />If I didn't have the tips and it was just straight gel polish I'm sure I could use less and it would take less time. But I wouldn't use this for that I do not think. Haven't yet. I should add I have had no damage to my natural using this stuff or pain on my natural nail. On my skin doesn't feel so hot but it does wash away and there's no redness or discomfort once washed off.  I can't even believe I'm leaving a review like this, this stuff can't be good for humans but then again I am no stranger to chemicals in beauty products.\n",
      "4242->Very comfortable for sleeping | 5 | 2 | I use this to prevent frizz on my curly hair while I sleep. It is comfortable, sufficiently cool so that it won't make my scalp sweat and stays put all night long, even though I move around a lot while I sleep.<br /><br />My wife loves how it looks, so that's a bonus.\n",
      "4252->very fine water | 3 | 2 | it produce a of very fine water when spray. bottle is aethetic. build quality is decent<br />Update: clogged after 50 spray or so, returned (5-&#62;3star)\n",
      "4272->Beautiful Colors, Good Quality! | 5 | 2 | Wow! This blush set is amazing! I haven't worn blush in years. I've just been using a multi-colored bronzer. Choosing the right blush color can be a challenge and this set is more than perfect. I wasn't expecting much at this price, so I was really impressed. I have olive skin and all the colors are beautiful. I've even used some colors as eye shadow. They are excellent as a base or transition color. Highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way. 1-3/8 square inch of each color. I tap my brush into multiple colors for a more natural look. Also works as a bronzer.<br />Arrived within a week in excellent condition. Product packaging is very plain and and cheap looking, so you will not be taking this with you for touch ups...and the included brush is useless. Who cares! Price and colors alone earn five stars! If I could make an improvement, it would be to re-design the packaging.\n",
      "4296->Multi-use oil | 5 | 2 | I first tried a tiny sample and then went looking for the product to buy. This stuff is great and smells good too.<br />It soaks into the skin very quickly and your skin looks great in the morning. I usually use it at night and another SPF 30 for the daytime.  If you notice the recent trends for face care is the Facial oils-  this product has been around for awhile- which is probably the groundbreaker for the Cosmetic industry finally getting on track with natural products.  LOVE IT.\n",
      "4302->A nice standard wipe for just about anything you'll put in your mouth | 4 | 2 | I don't have a retainer, but I do have a nightguard and I figured that since it's made out of the same stuff you'd see for some of the mouthguards and the like out there, why not give it a try? I'm always a little leery of brushing since I don't want to ruin my brushes or potentially harm my nightguard. Soaking it in some mouthwash is helpful, but then that isn't the same as a thorough clean.<br /><br />The taste of this is fairly nice. I like that it's not extremely overwhelming. You can wipe your guard down and it won't be insanely strong. There will be a hint of flavor, but overall it's not going to be anything that will knock your socks off. This might be disappointing for some, but it's still a better thing to taste than the alternative. If you have a guard of any type, you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />This will get into most of the crevices and areas of the average guard. You'll have to cram it into the more small areas, but it will fit everywhere. It seems to do a fairly good job of cleaning as well. I'd read that it could help get rid of stains and other discolorations, which is the biggest thing that appealed to me. So far I've done a few cloths and it seems to be helping a little. It's not a miracle worker, but then I wasn't expecting it to be and to be honest, I'd be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately. After all, what would it do to your mouth afterwards?<br /><br />This is a pretty good option and I'm curious to try the soaks to see what they would do as well.\n",
      "4309->Hair is noticeably shinier | 4 | 2 | I usually don't spend much on shampoo and my hair is generally very healthy. But I bought this because I noticed it starting to get drier.<br /><br />I've been using this for about two weeks. The first week I didn't really notice a difference in my hair. The second week, while my hair doesn't feel very different, I do notice it is a lot shinier.\n",
      "4311->Do not buy this for the summer!!! | 3 | 2 | It's not silk... It's not satin... It's imposter polyester!!!<br />Pros: I love that you receive 5 bonnets for a pretty decent price and they are reversible, they are big head/big hair friendly, and the colors look exactly as pictured.<br />Cons: Not summer/warm weather friendly (If you sweat in your hair a little more then the average person, you will be sweating buckets!), the material is not breathable at all (You can be sitting directly in front of a fan and not feel any air come through it).<br />I made the mistake of putting one in the washing machine and it stretched out the elastic band, so please learn from my mistake and by no means even try to put it in the washer HAND WASH ONLY!!\n",
      "4312->After Bath Skin Treat | 5 | 2 | Body butter is the perfect after-bath treat for your skin. Zia body butter is a combination of shea butter and mango butter blended into a smooth moisturizer that could become a hand cream essential. (The small sample container in the Spa To Go kits fits nicely in your purse.)<br /><br />This cream is super luxurious to use in the winter. This is one of the few products with myrrh essential oil.<br /><br />Ingredients: Infusion of organic aloe vera extract, organic ginko biloba extract, organic elder extract, organic chamomile extract, caprylic/capric triglyceride, stearic acid, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, safflower oil, shea butter, mango butter, polysorbate 60, stearyl alcohol, sweet almond oil, tocopherol, beta carotene, rosehip seed oil, cucumber extract, green tea extract, algae extract, sodium carbomer, lavender essential oil, myrrh essential oil, neroli essential oil, vetiver essential oil, benzoin gum, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben.<br /><br />Zia body butter is a rich moisturizing cream that absorbs fast and leaves your skin looking smooth and deeply moisturized. Using this product after the brown sugar body buff and Lavender Clary Sage Body Wash takes smooth skin to entirely new levels. If you use these three products and take a salt bath, then you may reach spa nirvana.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

It's so weak that I have to keep jamming the stickers onto my bath bombs every single day (in order to keep the wrapping around them).<br /><br />I also had to throw away a couple of them since they had been covered/ruined by the sales tag holding the roll together.

They are very large in diameter compared to others, but when tied they more gentle on my scalp.

Hope they can fix this issue would love to give it another try.\n",
      "4367->Use as an Ingredient in Body Butter | 5 | 2 | I recently made myself a body butter and used this oil in place of the almond oil the recipe called for. It worked really well. I will say however that this one bottle seems to be 125 ml as it filled up a half a cup. Using this in the body butter made the butter very luxurious. I now use it nightly on my hands and feet. You could also use this as a massage oil. I'm finding this really does make my skin look younger. After about a week you may notice a difference too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.\n",
      "4374->A headband that finally fits ! | 4 | 2 | I have purchased so many store headbands that have all !!! been to tight. These are not tight so they are comfortable. I'm not super crazy about the prints & wish they were a bit narrower. But, overall I'm okay with those things to be able to wear headbands.<br />I'd say give them a try for sure if you've found all the store headbands are to tight. They do look cute. I did have to wash them as the fabric had a strong chemical odor. Washing them removed the odor.\n",

      "4376->It's good to be different. | 4 | 2 | First, I got into ethique for the environmental benefits.  I looked at my cosmetics and face care collection and it just hit my how much waste I am producing in the name of vanity.  I also don't really have the time to sit down and make my own home brewed recipes either.  Stumbled across the Ethique brand and it was like aaaaaaaaahhhh.  One single use plastic down.  This is on par with what I pay for my other serums, if not actually a little cheaper.  I was able to try it in the sample pack - DO IT THERE FIRST!!  This sadly will not be a serum for everyone.  I have really, really, really dry skin.  Just genetics.  I also work outside and play outside year round so my skin is abused.  I need very heavy moisturizers.  If you have oily skin, or even mixed, this may not work for you, or it would be best used as a once a week quench.  It takes some tinkering to find out the right amount to put on.  I screwed it up the first two nights and over did it.  Plus, since I was used it with the lotion, my face was slippery it was like teflon.  As someone else said, a little goes a long, long way.  Be patient.  I pinch of the tiniest amounts and as soon as it hits my face it melts and is able to be spread around.  Pinch and repeat.<br /><br />I think this is the bees knees personally and will be using this.  I love how it travels.  I love I don't have to feel like a froufrou girl when I go into the backcountry with a serum.  Someone could certainly ask why I have so much soap... but whatever.  I hope they take another stab at this and make a lighter version for the girls that don't need to soak their faces.  Again, try the sample pack.  You get this, three facial soaps, and the lotion at a very fair price to try before you commit to the full size.  So if you hate it, you are still bound to find something you love.  And if you hate it and chuck, at least it's not another plastic bottle.\n",
      "4379->Intense Hydration | 5 | 2 | With winter approaching, it's time to start thinking about cold-weather skincare. This moisturizer is a good choice because it's a blend of several skin-loving oils like argan, coconut and macadamia. It's fairly lightweight but it protects and hydrates like a heavier cream. It can be used both day and night. The packaging is pretty enough for display. It can be used by all skin types. I highly recommend this product and the entire line from this brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

      "4387->NOT A HAPPY CAMPER! | 2 | 2 | This is my 3rd attempt to find a curl cream for my fine hair/classic curls.  I've been using this now for about 3 weeks and so far it's worked great for me.  Took me a few tries to get the correct balance, but now that I have that figured out, I'm a &#34;happy camper&#34;!  Leaves my hair shiny and feeling natural, not crunchy.  And because it doesn't leave my hair feeling dirty,  I can wash my hair every few days rather than everyday. Thanks Miss Jessie!!<br /><br />Well, this is my second review of this product.  I've changed my opinion because after using this for a couple of weeks, I found that it left my hair feeling dirty and dingy.  I can only say that I think because my hair is fine it created a &#34;buildup&#34; of product, so I am moving onto my next choice.\n",
      "4391->Forget mixing up a powder, this is so much better than that | 5 | 2 | No one tells you when you are young that your face will break out even as an adult. Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

      "4396->The product works amazing!! | 3 | 2 | First I want to say the three stars is for the product itself, which works great. Taking two stars off is for packaging, shipment, and customer service. So I ran out of nail polish remover not that long ago and have been looking for a better way to remove the nail polish with out all the chemicals. To my surprise I found this and was excited to try a all natural nail polish remover.  Made with all plant based ingredients which is a huge plus for me. I hate the way traditional nail polish remover smells and I hate using that stuff for my daughters nails. Now I feel comfortable using this with my daughter so she does not have to breath in those harsh fumes. I did not have any nail polish on at first so I put some on and let it dry. Once it was dry I put one to two drops on each nail then waited about 2 to 3 minutes. It wiped right off on all the nails except one small spot that came off with one more drop.<br /><br />When this bottle arrived it was leaking all over the box. The seal was broken and the plastic wrapped around the lid was torn. So I had very little left in the bottle. I contacted the seller to let them know and to see about getting a replacement bottle. I took some time to get a response but they did respond. After the second email they sent a code for a replacement. That code did not work so I reached out to them again. They said it is on amazon and that the code has worked for others. I tried multiple times and the code did not work. So even if it is on amazon to supply correct codes, the seller needs to do their part in making the experience pleseant with the customer and this was not that.<br /><br />Still pleased with the product itself though.<br /><br />I received this free or reduced price for product testing and review. Thank you and I hope you find this review helpful. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

      "4399->Pulled My Hair! | 2 | 2 | I purchased this brush to use on my very long and thick curly hair. The brush is perfect for using in the shower because of the way its shaped and made.<br />However, after just one use, I noticed that my hair would get stuck in the bottom of the bristles and it would pull my hair really awfully and frequently. I now use the brush very rarely.<br />Shipping took a long time, as well.<br />So depending on your necessity for the product and whether you have a tender or sensitive scalp, this brush may work for you; it was definitely a bargain!!\n",
      "4406->Works great | 4 | 2 | \"Jeff's Wife\" - I've used the white name brand for years and some store brands but not the charcoal ones. These work just as good as the others, although I'm not sure if the charcoal really makes a difference.<br /><br />The description photos show slits in the strip but I haven't seen them in mine, not a big deal but they do serve a purpose. There is quite a bit of black residue left over (there's also residue left over when using the white ones, the black is just more visible) but it rinses away easily with warm water.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these.\n",
      "4408->TRASH DO NOT BUY- WONT LAST 1 WEEK | 1 | 2 | This is the worst hair I have ever had. Upon first inspection the hair seems to been standard with thin ends, not surprising. However upon further inspection I discovered the following:<br /><br />1. this hair tangles severely once wet<br />2. its brittle and breaks easily<br />3. it sheds more then the standard amount per day<br /><br />This hair is so bad I had to CUT IT OUT MY HEAD WHILE ON VACATION, this is no exaggeration. The only reason why I'm so pissed is because I did extensive research and spend a lot of time before I choose this hair. I expected low quality but surly it could last for 12 damn days!!! NO!!!<br /><br />The hair cuticles are damaged beyond repair and likely mixed with synthetic hair which is why it tangles and does not bleach well. I want my money bad I feel scammed and what they advertise is FALSE!!!!!!!<br /><br />I would give them -5 stars if I could that's how bad this hair is. DO NOT BUY<br /><br />I know how to take care of hair and nothing I did would keep it from tangling. It was installed by a professional.<br /><br />Once water hits its it’s a wrap!\n",
      "4418->Ehhhhh | 1 | 2 | This came broken open and the box saturated.<br />Then, It really stinks like smelly.<br />It burns a little.<br />not really a fan.<br />The company wanted me to return the defective item which it fine but not worth the work.\n",
      "4421->Horrible smell | 1 | 2 | Edit- I ended up throwing these (and the hand sanitizer inside) in the garbage. The smell never dissipated like I hoped they would and starting making other items in my cabinet stink. I don’t have a sensitive nose and normally smells don’t bother me but this was too much<br /><br />These bottles look nice and are well made. Unfortunately anything you put in them ends up with a horrible smell. I put lotion in one and hand sanitizer in another and both came out smelling disgusting. I had to wash my hands immediately after using the products because my hands smelled so bad.\n",
      "4430->This stuff actually works! | 4 | 2 | I had a pretty ugly blackhead on my nose. For weeks I tried everything to get rid of it. I even asked my girlfriend for some beauty tips. Nothing worked. After awhile I noticed it getting bigger so I became desperate. I did something most guys would ever do... I visited a beauty salon that specializes in skin care. Fortunately for me, the lady I spoke to didn't want to take my money and told me to just pick up a bottle of Vi-Tae Blackhead remover. She told me all this mombo jumbo about why and how it works and I pretended like I understood but it all flew over my head. I went home later that night and found it on Amazon. Honestly, I didn't want to spend $30+ dollars on a health and beauty product because, well, I'm a guy. But I took the lady's advice and went with it. Like Prime normally does, I got it in two days. I followed the directions - apply every morning to damp skin, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse. I have to be honest... I didn't see any difference after the first day. The blackhead was still there. I did it again the second day. Nothing. Third day. Zilch. Fourth day. Nada. I was becoming impatient and felt ripped off. However, after I applied it on the fifth day, the blackhead was gone after I rinsed it! I was like WHOA! This girly stuff really works. Before I start to rave about this stuff, I have to say that it didn't get it all out. If I look close enough, I can still see a tiny spec left in my pore. But I'll just continue using this stuff and see what happens. In all honesty, no one else can see it anymore. But my girlfriend said to continue keeping it clean so it doesn't come back.<br /><br />FYI, I'm a 31 year old Asian male with pretty oily skin.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Actually works but it can take up to a week to remove a large blackhead<br />- Smells good and refreshing<br />- Directions are easy to follow<br /><br />CONS:<br />- This stuff will sting the first few times you use it. It's not unbearable but it's pretty annoying<br />- It's a tad difficult to rinse off after you let it sit for a few minutes\n",
      "4431->I love these bibs | 5 | 2 | I love these bibs!  My son really needs these, he is one and a bit messy. He has lots of teeth coming in and lots of sisters who enjoy feeding him lots things. They go on easily with a small snap on the back and stay put. They come off easily and the material is great. It's beathable and I can throw them right in the washing machine. They come witha nice cloth bag that has a draw string so I can keep them together. Nice and easy just like it should be. My son looks adorable and I am very happy.<br />I purchased this product at a reduced price for an honest and unbiased review\n",
      "4439->My dentist told me I needed a crown, so I got one! | 4 | 2 | This tiara is beautiful. The design is actually much nicer in person.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Shiny<br />-3 extra crystals included (in case you lose one)<br />-Rose Gold Shade Beautiful<br />-Good Weight<br />-Tiara Teeth quality strong<br />-Metal band flexible<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Damaged Box (mine had holes, was open, and indented- tiara in great condition)<br />-A crystal fell off as i was trying it on (Luckily you cant even tell, so im not going to replace it)<br />-Uneven Tiara Teeth ( be careful bending it back into place as crystals can fall off)<br /><br />Overall: I would recommend. Its really pretty, well worth the price. I've purchased a couple other tiaras that were double or triple the price of this, that weren't even as nice as this one. Quality is great.\n",

      "4441->WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU GET ........... | 2 | 2 | As promised, I received 5 products in my \"mystery\" package. However, they weren't the products shown. I still would have been fine with that had I felt I was still getting a good value. Personally, I've never heard of LORAC COSMETICS (one item was CARGO BRAND which I also don't recognize) and maybe they're great brands, but to be told I was getting $130 dollars worth of product is simply a case of false advertising (to put it nicely).<br />The concept of these beauty boxes, is to try new products, so all is not lost. I'm always excited, ready and willing to discover my next great find! But as far as beauty boxes go, I would skip this one.\n",
      "4451->This really works. | 5 | 2 | This is THE BEST dry shampoo I've used, and I've tried many.  It leaves no residue, emits no offensive odor, and does not dampen your hair when applied.  The most important thing is that it somehow manages to visibly increase the volume of my superfine, thin hair.  It doesn't leave a ton of product in my hair and the results last all day.  It is a miracle product for me and I hope it will be for<br /> you, too.\n",
      "4461->Extremely Disappointed | 2 | 2 | These were super cute for the first five seconds and then they peeled off.  Bought these to wear to LAN and was super disappointed.  The first night they went on easily but by the time I actually got to the festa they’d mostly come off.  The second night I didn’t even make it out the door before they peeled off my friend and I.<br /><br />Will not be buying again.  Waste of money.  I’ll just be buying UV paint.\n",
      "4464->Simple Scent Free Skin Care Absorbs Easily Does It Do What It Says? | 4 | 2 | I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.\n",
      "4468->Four Stars | 1 | 2 | Advertised for the mature women. This mature women wishes it wasn't so shinny.<br />After using it for a week,I found it to be a very inferior product. Would not recommend.\n",
      "4478->Doesn't Work, Plain & Simple | 1 | 2 | I was hoping this would work for me...I've been going through so many brands of natural deodorants that it's getting ridiculous. Either they simply don't work in preventing odor, or they give me a rash - sometimes both.<br /><br />This hasn't given me a rash (though sometimes my rashes don't develop until I'm mostly done with a product) and it's unlikely to because I can't see how I'll continue to use this. It does not prevent odor (it's one and only job), and has the added awfulness of mixing with body odor to create an even funkier smell. On top of that, the pump has basically stopped working and the bottle is more than half full, so now I have to unscrew the cap or risk the pump spraying EVERYWHERE. Add on the hefty price tag and this just isn't worth it. One star because it's a lotion and not a paste or gel (I guess).\n",
      "4491->New Favorite!! | 5 | 2 | Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies, this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof, so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "4499->Ridiculous | 2 | 2 | I've worn hats that look like construction helmets with built in beer holders and THIS is the dumbest thing I've ever put on my head.<br /><br />I ordered silver gray but I got bright white.\n",
      "4502->Update: Broken | 3 | 2 | Update: Broke very easily (setting something down in it). Very disappointed.<br /><br />Prior review: Great for counter organization. I use it for my hair styling stuff, face care creams/etc, and makeup brushes! It’s the right size for what I wanted it for and looks much better than my prior set up. Highly recommend\n",
      "4503->It is what it said it would be | 4 | 2 | It is a telescoping mirror, it does have a light.  My husband could only use it to inspect the sole of his foot.  Since it does not angle in all directions it is hard to inspect the top of the foot or the lower leg.<br /><br />For the bottom of the foot, good device\n",
      "4512->Disappointed. | 1 | 2 | With 4 bathrooms with faucets  in this house I thought it would fit on at least one!<br /> It' didn't!\n",
      "4513->Works Well on Dry, Cracked Heels | 5 | 2 | I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven’t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It’s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven’t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don’t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress – my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they’re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It’s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.\n",
      "4514->Wanted it to work for me... | 2 | 2 | I've been using this curler for the last few weeks & as much as I wanted to love it, I don't.  The curler itself is very well made, it is durable, the spring works great, & the finger grips make it easy to grip without fear of it slipping.  The only design flaw that I've found is that the rubber pad that curls my lashes already has a slit in it from where the metal & rubber meet.  The other issue which is why it doesn't work for me is the curve of the actual curler.  It is very wide which, but the curve of the curler is too strait for my eyes.  I have almond shaped eyes & I guess a slightly smaller eye socket.  In order to get all of my lashes in the curler I have to press the curler into my eyelid & then adjust the angle to get them in a few times to get the curler close enough to the base of my lashes.  If I only had to press the curler lightly on my eyelid that would be one thing, but I have to really press & almost flatten out my eyelid for it to work.  Even after that I get maybe a creased &#34;curl&#34;.  My lashes are quite long & bone strait & even pumping the curler a few times up my lashes doesn't give much of a curl.  By the time I put on mascara they are almost strait again.  I've been using curlers for 20 some odd years now & honestly the drug store ones work better for me personally.<br /><br />If you have short lashes & more oval eyes this may be a great curler for you & I do recommend it for the quality.  Good luck!\n",
      "4520->We Tried EVERYTHING To Get This To Work | 2 | 2 | When it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.\n",
      "4542->Recommend to people with receding gums | 4 | 2 | Brushes are very soft. I have receding gums and normal, even soft, toothbrush is just too much for my teeth.. I use my ultrasound one in the evening normally and this super soft one in the morning. Had no gum bleeds and no painful moments while brushing. Well impressed!<br />The only issue I found - it’s handle in too sleek and plastic.. it becomes slippery if it’s getting whet. Some friction could be added..\n",
      "4543->Great shampoo, crappy bottles and pumps... | 4 | 2 | I can't speak to whether or not the product sold from Amazon is fake or not, as I don't order it from here.  I usually buy it from the salons or from trusted sellers on Ebay for a much more reasonable price.  Having said that, I really like this shampoo.  It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.  While I don't think this shampoo has caused new hair growth, I do feel as if it's strengthened each individual strand to give my hair a slightly fuller look.  Don't get me wrong...it's not an Earth-shattering change, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars is because every single shampoo bottle I have ever purchased has been faulty.  They leak, the pump either breaks or doesn't work from the start, and the plastic is flimsy.  If it's been mailed to me, it inevitably leaks all over the package and I lose a substantial amount of product, which is pretty frustrating.<br /><br />Overall though, a great product!\n",
      "4545->Take Your Pick | 5 | 2 | This mask set allows you to choose exactly what your skin needs on any given day. There are five types. There's one for hydration, firming, brightening, healthy aging, and pore detoxing. For best results, leave the masks on for at least 15 minutes. Use the excess serum on your neck. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "4546->really wished it worked | 1 | 2 | I bought this hoping it would help with my acne/pigmentation. However, after using this product for two months- I saw no changes. Sighhh. I hope it works for you though!<br /><br />The product itself, is light and absorbed easily for me.\n",
      "4547->Strong, Lingering Scent | 4 | 2 | I bought this product because I have one cat that gets dandruff/dry skin on his lower back. I only used the product once and it didn't irritate his skin or harm him in any way. It seemed to work after one use, but don't quote me on that. Every animal is different and it may not do the same for yours.<br /><br />However, the scent of this shampoo was so strong that it rubbed off onto my other cat. I smelled it for weeks all over my house. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was strange and mildly annoying to my nose. Just to note: I rinsed my cat extremely thoroughly! He doesn't fight me in the bath, so I can run the water and everything.\n",
      "4556->DREADFUL. MINUS FIVE STARS. | 1 | 2 | Should've been marketed as single use hairclips!<br /><br />The worst thing about these is the completely shoddy way they've been 'engineered' or made to fit together. As in, they don't. At all.<br /><br />They really only LOOK like hair clips. The plastic parts lever against each other in odd ways and put pressure on the ridiculously thin wire that connects the two plastic parts and in no time what you have three pieces of trash in your hand and no clip for your hair.<br /><br />I only need one to hold everything on top of my head, that's how thin my hair is, yet this fragile little joke-clip couldn't handle holding even that. I used a similar product from Amazon, sold 24 to a card and bought simultaneously, and it was an interesting comparison: In a week I threw away 8 of these clips I'm currently reviewing, most of which simply self-destructed on regular, gentle use, sometimes on the FIRST use. The other clip? I'm still using it and that was more than a month ago.<br /><br />So in the week I kept track I threw out 8 of these because they fell to pieces. This means they were self-destructing at the rate of more-than-one a day, so yeah, complete waste of my money.<br /><br />Well, perhaps not *complete*. I do still have a container I can put something else in. Like another purchase of those 24 on a card ones, for instance.\n",
      "4567->Looks realistic! | 4 | 2 | LOVE THESE! Large size and easy to apply.<br /><br />I got these for a beach vacation with friends, we thought it'd be fun to have them at the pool/beach. They stay on very well (heads up too, you will tan/burn with the shadow of it on you!).<br /><br />When they do start coming off though it gets a little sticky and I even had it get on my sheets. It's hard to get it off your skin at that point and due to the stickiness and that I knocked off a star. I will buy again though!\n",
      "4571->Just okay | 2 | 2 | I have a love hate relationship with these scrunchies. They're very thin which is nice sometimes when you don't need a big bulky scrunchie like on the end of a braid. However, they don't feel very soft. They also stretch out very easily.<br />Better for those with thin hair.\n",
      "4589->Roomy organizer set | 5 | 2 | I have been looking for a way to organize not only my make up, but some small art stuff on my bed side table. This acrylic set is exactly what I have been looking for. The first part of the set is a large organizer with drawers. Each drawer slides out nicely and even has a little black liner inside to help keep the bottom clean and keep things from rolling around. This is especially helpful with make up items, which can leave a mess.<br /><br />The next two pieces both can fit perfectly on top of the organizer. It has an indent on the top that keeps the other organizers from sliding around.<br />One has a curved area and the other has small box like shapes. These work well for make up sponges.<br /><br />It gives plenty of space for keeping everything within reach and organized. I dislike having a bunch of things falling off the table, so this organizer has made things a lot easier.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT  (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I HAVE TRIED THIS AND EVALUATED IT ACCORDINGLY\n",

      "4603->Lack quality control but are okay | 3 | 2 | I had a similarly priced product before this that I loved, had 100 less than this so I figured I'd be thrifty and get these.<br /><br />Packaging seemed okay on these at first. Its an outer bag with four sleeve bags inside. When I opened the main bag, I saw that it looked like someone just kind of shoved these things in the sleeves. Not a guge deal, just a sloppy presentation.<br /><br />Inside the packaging is interesting too, as the attached photo shows, I had 2 sleeves that had clipped sides of various degrees. Some like the picture, ranging up to almost a fourth of the round being clipped off. The other 2 sleeves were perfectly fine. Just shows a lack of quality contol for sure.<br /><br />They are thinner than I'd like, but they are soft. They are absorbant enough for my toner and astringent that I use. I hadn't run into any linting issues like others have shown. They do the job.<br /><br />In all honesty, I'll go back to my other brand after i run out of these. These work fine and they do what they are supposed to. Just the lack of that little something that makes you want to come back, like the packaging and QC.\n",
      "4605->Great formula. Very dense pigments. Would buy again...and have. | 5 | 2 | I really like these stamping polishes.<br />The pigmentation is amazing, they apply well, and dry fast. They don't smudge if you wait for them to dry and then use a decent top coat.<br />The only thing I dislike, is the flakiness of the stamping polish around the nail bed, when it dries. It can be messy. Which is why a latex protector may help with clean up. But that's no big deal. Once all is said and done, a quick acetone cleanup or even a hand washing can remove the excess...and once I'm more experienced at application, it may get easier to avoid too. I admit I'm fairly new with stamping. And I would absolutely not remove a star for that anyway!<br />It does what is says. It applies great and looks amazing. It picks up beautiful with every stamper I have...about 10 different heads and 7 different styles of stamper. So, I'd say it's a good product.<br />I'd but them again and recommend them to anyone who's into stamping!<br /><br />Update:<br />Using it a few more times has shown that I just needed practice...it's amazing. Stamps beautifully. I'll add pics. The mess that isn't caught my latex skin protection, can easily be washed away after nails are top coated and completely dry, or with acetone and a brush.  I love these stamping polishes from BMC. I've bought 3 sets of them now. The pics I'm uploading include black stamping polish from this set, and purple (amethyst) stamping polish from another set.\n",
      "4614->Beautiful fragrance, not so great price | 4 | 2 | Be wary when purchasing fragrances here. The Abercrombie homepage site has much better pricing on the 1 oz ($29.50), 1.7 oz ($49.50), and 3.4 oz ($59.50) of this spray. This was the pricing as of Nov 10 2006. (And *always* do a search for coupons available before buying anything online!)<br /><br />This particular scent is what is wafting out of every A&F store in the mall right now. It's difficult to describe. It's lemony, woodsy, spicy, modern, cool, and hot at the same time! It's a scent that seems to work for just about everyone who tries it. Men like it very much. My husband thought it was a cologne for the guys, and indeed, it smells delicious on him- in a completely different way- than it does on me. It's very unisex without losing the sexiness!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this as a stocking stuffer purchase, starting with the 1 oz size to see if the recipient likes it.<br /><br />I gave it four out of five stars because it does need reapplication a bit more often, since it is a spray and not a thicker base perfume.\n",
      "4618->Very good performance and an excellent scent | 5 | 2 | I'm very pleased with all aspects of this face wash. It's a medium consistency that dispenses easily. The pump mechanism works well to output just a small amount at a time which is a plus since not much is needed per use. It lathers readily and does an excellent job of cleaning. My face feels tight after using it but in a good way -- a clean tightness rather than a dried out tightness.<br /><br />The scent is excellent. It's a woodsy type of scent that is different and very enjoyable. The scent does not linger after use (which is a shame since it is such a nice smell).<br /><br />It's pricey per ounce, but considering how little is needed for good results, the cost per use is not bad at all. Plus the scent is so unique that, for me, it's worth the extra amount. Five stars!\n",
      "4620->Quit working after 12 days | 2 | 2 | Worked for 12 days, but on the 12th day, when it ran out of water and I pushed to button to turn it off, it would not turn off.  The Mode button also had ceased to work.  After about a minute of me pushing buttons and shaking it, if quit and indicated the battery was exhausted.  So much for going 30 days as advertised.  I recharged it for about 6 hours until it glowed green indicating a full charge, and I disconnected the cord for charging and pressed the on button but nothing and it immediately indicated it needed to be recharged.<br /><br />When it worked, I was not thrilled with it.  It has three buttons in a row at the top, the top one being the one to release the little nozzle wand for want of a better term, the second one the on/off button and the third being the mode button.  When you go  to use it, and you decide to stop while it still has water in it, you need to turn it off while keeping the nozzle wand in your mouth so you don't shoot water everywhere but you cannot see the buttons so you just start pushing and maybe you will get lucky and hit the power button, but just as often, you will hit the mode button and it just starts working at a different pressure as you grope around.  My solution was to not stop when I wanted to but keep going until it ran out, then pull it away from my face far enough to  find the buttons and turn it off.<br /><br />It is not practical to try to rotate the nozzle wand so is easier to use by just rotating the whole unit which means you lose track of where the buttons even are.\n",
      "4625->Can’t return…color not very nice.  😕 | 1 | 2 | “For safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can’t be returned to Amazon. For more information or help, please contact us.”  This is a ridiculous no-return policy…they shipped it to me with these ingredients, why can’t I return it…it has the same ingredients!<br />The color is chalky and not very pretty and for the price$$$, it should be better.  Very disappointed. 🌹🙁\n",
      "4635->The soaps are all individually wrapped and I really like the packaging | 3 | 2 | The soaps are all individually wrapped and I really like the packaging.  I haven't used the soaps, since they're being given as gifts, but I like the soap size and presentation.  These were pretty close to exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />The one thing I'm not so fond of is the \"Order More\" stickers on the back of each individual soap.  It feels tacky for a gift to have that on there, and I don't feel like I can remove them without tearing and marring the soap wrapping.  If they'd put one sticker on the back of the larger plastic encasement (each encasement holds four soaps) it would be easier to remove without damaging the packaging, and/or it wouldn't look as tacky as it does being placed on every single bar of soap.\n",
      "4637->You're going to love how this feels on your face! | 5 | 2 | I love to feel this on my face, neck and eye area. It is very soothing to me and I feel it's helping with the puffiness around my eyes in particular. I've only had it less than a month so I don't know if it's truly an anti-wrinkle treatment, but I don't care. I love how it makes me feel. I'm pondering on keeping it in the freezer in the summer. I live in Las Vegas and it gets quite hot here and I doubt if it would be as cold as it is now on my face.<br /><br />It is made out of Rose quartz, which has the healing properties of peace, healing and comfort. It also stands for unconditional love.\n",
      "4641->Really Nice Product | 4 | 2 | Savanaah's Organic Argan Oil is a good product.  It goes on smoothly without leaving the skin feeling &#34;clammy&#34;.<br />The dispenser provides just the right amount of oil. Since my hands dry out easily from washing them a &#34;guzillion&#34; times daily,<br />I apply this product after each handwashing.  My hands feel  moisturized without being overwhelmed  by the oil.  Some other oils have a tendency to not provide a lasting effect. I like this one just fine.\n",

      "4647->Depends on how you use it | 4 | 2 | If you are wanting this to basically curl your ends under or to style your bangs and give them some volume...it's perfect for that.<br /><br />If you are wanting this to style your hair from wet to dry or to actually curl longer hair, no this isn't what you want at all.<br /><br />I had originally purchased this for myself, I have long hair and it was a disaster basically.. my daughter on the other hand has a short hairstyle and this works great to flip her ends under and add volume to it.<br /><br />The low setting is very low, if you have very fine hair if might work for you otherwise stick with high.<br /><br />Item was received at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review - that in no way affected my opinion\n",

Do not over dry<br />And four do NOT scrub off. I started to but then read the instructions about slowly heating it off with wet washcloth.<br />Worked wonders! My skin is smooth and silky and feels like I went to a spa.<br />I don't want to overuse bc of sensitive skin but I highly recommend!!<br />+for all age women and men for spa like experience and relaxation\n",

      "4667->What hapoened to the product? | 2 | 2 | Bought this is 2015 when I lived in so cal.  My hair did not like it but I kept it anyways as a back up.  Now I'm in Colorado and my hair loves it so I reordered.<br />Now the product link is different, but figured they just changed the label...I received the same bottle as I had, totally different than the photo shown here, and it is completely watered down.  It used to be conditioner like texture now it's just runny and doesn't work.  I dont know what happened but it's going back.\n",
      "4672->Do NOT buy! | 1 | 2 | These are TERRIBLE! I didn’t have high hopes so I didn’t think they could really let me down, but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />They are so cheaply made and thin. The tips are uneven and it looks like a 3 year old painted the line.<br /><br />There is no “glue” so the instructions are invalid. The glue strips have a perforated plastic liner so when you try to separate the perforations break and you have little plastic liner squares stuck in the glue.<br /><br />Do not buy this brand.\n",
      "4673->Mediocre | 2 | 2 | Upon first opening the jar, there’s a thumb size print/scoop in the middle of it as if it was used? Not sure but it doesn’t look good. Also, a bit expensive for the amount you get.<br />Tip: It’s a really heavy product so less is definitely more...\n",
      "4676->Stank after 4 hours | 2 | 2 | Didn’t work long for my pits, lasted 4 hours on a hot day without too much effort. Gave two stars because seemed to work well for other areas but I have never felt the need to deodorize them anyways. Also arrived without a lid.<br />Scent note (not a complaint) the lime smells like lime juice, like from a bottle, not the sweeter lime zest a lot of flavorings do, to each their own just FYI\n",
      "4681->Well Constructed and Looks Pretty | 5 | 2 | After seeing reviews on YouTube as well as reading them here, I decided to go for it.<br /><br />It is only a little bit smaller than I expected, however, it is larger than one I purchased earlier of similar design but from a different company. I love that you get an extra piece nestled inside the bottom drawer. I'm using the extra piece for my base and top coats as well as small bottles of polish remover and my hand creams. That piece alone holds as much as the Glossybox box I was using but takes up less room and makes it easier to see and get my hands on the things I use most ofter. If I could buy the drawers separately, I would so that I could organize the rest of my manicure stuff.<br /><br />I also love that the bottom drawer is nearly twice as deep as the middle drawer. I don't have to worry about thicker compacts or powder boxes tripping up the drawer.<br /><br />This organizer is made of very durable and substantial material. It feels substantial as well and it holds a lot more than the other organizer. Now I can have a drawer for each type of makeup. The only things I can't fit in it are the W7 eyeshadow palettes and the NYX makeup palette I have.<br /><br />Really happy I took the plunge and got this. I would recommend you get this before the sale price disappears but it is well worth it even at the full price.\n",
      "4682->Bought this because it was cheaper compared to those live videos | 3 | 2 | I'm sure you all have seen the expensive wands and straighteners being used in facebook lives, I have tried to win one of them for months but with no luck. I'm afraid to spend a lot of money on one and it not work. I picked this one because of its 1 inch size and that it is ceramic coated titanium. My hair is hard to curl and doesn't hold so we shall see.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for now because it seems like it takes longer than my other tools to heat up, it also says it goes to 400 degrees but again compared to my straightner at 400 degrees it doesn't seem as hot. It is a pretty color and comes in a nice packaging so that's a plus. It also has a glove with it and that's a bonus for someone using a wand for the first time. I use my straightener to curl at the moment and it will stay until I wash it  but not so much luck finding an affordable wand that can do that. I'm going to practice this a few times and Ill update my review.\n",
      "4687->I like the gel rests the best because they are the ... | 4 | 2 | This rest solves the gel rest problem. I like the gel rests the best because they are the most comfortable and durable. I can sanitize them better than any other rests I've used. The problems I've had with most of the gel neck rests, is they are only good until they get wet, then they slip off. I've tried the gel rests with the built in suction cups before. They are better than the ones without, but they eventually give way when wet as well. The major pro with this item is the suction cups are made of material that are not gel. They adhere terrifically. They are built around the gel and attached that way. I'm assuming one would want to keep that area dry in between uses so it doesn't eventually break down there.<br />The only problem I have is the single cup does not reach to the outside under the sink. Not sure if my sink has too thick of a rest? Either way, it is not made for universal use. Nevertheless, it still stays on, the single one just stays un attached. It does get caught on the chair sometimes if I am not careful when I bring the client up from the bowl. If this company would make this rest a little longer in the single cup area, it would fit most sinks, and I would sing their praises and look for a way to rate it with 10 stars!\n",
      "4688->Don't waste your money!!! | 1 | 2 | Lousy! Stuff<br />Really disappointing\n",
      "4692->OK, but outperformed by a $10 foil electric | 3 | 2 | I got this shaver in early January of 2007.  For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).<br /><br />Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).<br /><br />I kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.<br /><br />In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.\n",
      "4694->They could be BIGGER | 4 | 2 | I bought another brand, and they came in too small.<br />So I bought these, and they ARE bigger, but I need a little bit BIGGER.<br />I have MAN TEETH.<br />These are like... BIG WOMAN teeth. 😐\n",
      "4697->Comfortable | 4 | 2 | Suction cups not secured well enough to compete with the suction cups.<br />Otherwise, very comfortable. Easy to clean and drys relatively fast!\n",

      "4716->Disappointing | 1 | 2 | Looks cheap to me. I thought the dangling chains were already attached but they come separately with 2 lobster clasps. There’s only 1 loop to connect a clasp to. The top one is no where to be found so my best guess is that you just connect it to the stem of the thing. The tips of the leaves are really sharp.<br /><br />Overall it’s just a bit of molded metal, chain, and cheap beads. Not worth the money\n",
      "4724->Amazing product but  be careful! | 4 | 2 | Last about 3-4 days for me since I have oily skin and use oils in my daily skincare regimen. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend using this at the end of the day or when your face has produced some oil to protect it from getting a reaction (similar to when you bleach your hair). Mistakenly, I used this after washing my face and my skin reacted so badly from the dye that it ended up burning and scabbing the area. One capsule is like 3 separate dye process for me so I just pour enough for one process and put the rest back in a mini baggie. Next, my dye process in 3 different application. 1-2 minute just to get a light overall shape, the 2nd application for 3-4 minutes follows the shape guidelines, 2-3 minutes for details/touch ups. If the front of the brows ends up coming out too blocky, just use a qtip with some makeup remover to fade out the front to make it look more natural. Since it fades so fast on my skin, I usually just let the first day brows go dark bc it lightens significantly because of skincare/face washing.<br /><br />Update:<br />I had stop using it so frequently (every week) bc if felt like my skin was getting more and more sensitive from it. I noticed that the more frequently I used it the more of an allergic reaction I got from it. I had to stop using it for a couple of months and have tried it again. I probably won’t be using this as an everyday routine but only for special occasions.\n",
      "4738->Pump broke and product has chemical odor | 2 | 2 | The product itself seems ok though it has a chemical smell to it.<br /><br />The packing is very fancy and after two weeks, I could no longer dispense it as designed I had to remove the lid and dispense from the bottle to my hand.  Hard to control amount dispensed this way and used more than I needed.<br /><br />I wish I'd listened to a previous review.\n",
      "4742->Ball applicator interesting, but ineffective - leaked a lot in shipping | 3 | 2 | This is one of those things where I can't really tell if it's working for a long time, so I'm not even going to comment on the benefits of the serum itself since I didn't notice any de-puffing, or improved skin tone.<br /><br />When I received this, the little storage pouch was damp, which I thought was odd. I opened it, and there was a little moisture around the cap which was also sealed in plastic. Now, I live in Denver, so I'm not really sure if the leakage was caused by the the item being moved to higher elevation - we're used to that kind of thing here - but I don't really know how much of the product I lost due to leakage. I can say for sure though, that at just 10 ml for the whole bottle, I lost at least 10% of the product, and I think it's a safe guess to put it between 20-30% or more.<br /><br />As for the ball roller, I found it uncomfortable to use on my eyes, so I actually just rub it on my finger tips and apply it from there. I do feel like that prevents over-usage as I've had with other Hyaluronic Acid creams which tend to go a LONG way, and can be hard to use as sparingly as is appropriate.<br /><br />Bottom line - the roller ball applicator is a novelty, but I wouldn't order this one again.\n",
      "4751->More neon in person. | 5 | 2 | Definitely more neon in person, and even more neon outside in the sun, but it's hard to capture in a picture. Some lights it looks more orange and some lights it looks more pink, but it's definitely a bright and vibrant summer color. If you are outside in the sun - you could be an air traffic controller with your nails!<br /><br />The polish itself went on nicely and only needed two coats to have full coverage without looking blotchy. I also love the rounded tip to the brush - makes the polish easy to put on without getting your cuticles.\n",
      "4754->Very Sparkly | 5 | 2 | I pretty much chose this product based on the shout-out to Arrested Development. This is a loose pigment with a super-fine texture. I opened it when a ceiling fan was on and it went flying. You'll want to use this with a mixing medium to make it stick. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.\n",
      "4777->Very small | 1 | 2 | Way too small. Not worth buying that.<br />Can only use it three times then it's finished.<br />Waste of money\n",
      "4787->Can't see your polish colors | 2 | 1 | This stand is beautful and it goes together so easily. The legs have magnets on them which just stick to the little magnets on the body of the display. Unfortunately, when I put my nail polishes on it, I coul only see the colors of the bottles on the first (lowest) row. The bottles lined up so that they covered up each other and I couldn't see the colors. I had to pick up each bottle on the upper rows to see what color it was.<br /><br />So, if you want this to contain your polish bottles and keep them together neatly, this would totally work for you and be great. However, if you're looking for something that will display your polishes, and let you see rows of colors, this is not it.\n",
      "4797->Great for Travel | 3 | 1 | As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.\n",
      "4801->Great for Acne, Fresh And Clean Feel. | 4 | 1 | I received NOTS brand 28 Day Remedy on June 12th as a promotional item from the company. This product is available with Amazon Prime Delivery so it came in about 3 days. This is nice because I don't like being without my skincare for more than a few days.<br /><br />I have been using 28 Day Remedy twice a day for 10 days now. I have had serious acne problems in the past and usually I would have to use multiple acne care products to keep my skin clear. For me this serum by itself was enough to keep my acne problems away. I did however incorporate this into my normal skincare routine, meaning I used this after my normal toner and followed it with my normal moisturizer.<br /><br />I really like this serum, it absorbs very well into the skin, which for me is the biggest factor. It does not leave a tacky or sticky film on the skin. Also, a little goes a long way. Before, I have used other Korean brand skincare and serums like Skin&Lab Dr. Color Effect Red Serum and also Zymogen Ferment Houttuniya Cordata Extract Serum. I would choose 28 Day Remedy above both Skin&Lab and Zymogen. 28 Day Remedy is more effective for my skin regeneration and healing than Red Serum without the stickiness. Also it absorbs better and quicker than Zymogen and is more effective against acne on its own.<br /><br />This product did smooth my skin texture and any breakouts I had starting were gone by the next morning. Overall this is a very good product especially if you have had problems with acne in the past. I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the price point is a little high for most people. But this product does do what it promises on the packaging and is a quality product.<br /><br />-Sonya H.\n",
      "4805->Fun color but not practical | 4 | 1 | This color is a lot of fun. It's a beautiful shade of blue and very sparkly!<br />But<br />The gloss is kind of goopy and thick, it gets on everything your lips touch, and doesn't look good with most skin tones (took it to the bar and a bunch of us tried it).  It also makes teeth look yellowish.<br />But<br />It's so fun!!!!!  I work from home and when I'm feeling bored, silly, or just want something different I'll put this on and it just plain makes me happy.  And dangit, if a $6 tube of lip gloss can make you happy then it's worth it right??<br />So, 4 stars because it's fun and happiness in a tube!<br />Pic of me with a thick coat of it on, and my friend with a thinner coat.\n",
      "4825->I've been using this for about a week and honestly I haven't seen an improvement in my complexion or anything fancy but this is | 4 | 1 | This had me at Rose Quartz! I'm a rock collector and I am all about beauty so this definitely peaked my interest!<br /><br />I've been using this for about a week and honestly I haven't seen an improvement in my complexion or anything fancy but this is awesome to use before applying makeup. It seems to grab the makeup and hold it on longer. Weird I know it isn't the intended use but it works! I also use it after I've done my make up to set it. If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery. Definitely has a scent of Rose with a bit of a witch hazel after scent.<br /><br />The spray itself is medium mist and covers the entire face with one burst. It's very light and absorbs quickly.<br /><br />This is a nice hydrating mist that has a multitude of uses and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on personal use, quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way.\n",
      "4835->Real sable hair, nice point | 4 | 1 | This is a great deal on a kolinsky brush.. I'm an artist and have numerous other sable brushes, I was skeptical that this one would be real kolinsky hair at this price point but was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The quality of the hair and shaping of the brush head are both very nice.  The pointed filbert or cats tongue shape is versatile for creating thin lines or broader strokes.<br /><br />My only qualm with the brush is that the handle is a bit too short and I find it somewhat uncomfortable to use but this may or may not be an issue for you depending on how you like to  hold the brush\n",
      "4839->Just ok -- it actually bit me! | 3 | 1 | I was a bit taken in by the 5-star reviews for this shaver.  It didn’t work too good for me though.  I have a really thick beard and it grows fast.  Electrics just can’t get it all.  I typically shave with an electric, but follow up with an Atra dry shave to clean up missed spots.  I’ve tried all the major vendors and none knock it out of the park.  The blade on this one cuts just ok and it’s not comfortable…and it actually bit me once..lol.  Never had that problem out of the major vendors.  I used this for two days.  On the second day it wasn’t getting everything and wasn’t comfortable.  In the middle of the shave I decided to switch to my standby Braun and it was night and day more comfortable…and it cut better.  Of course, the Braun costs 6-7 times as much so that’s a factor.<br /><br />This isn’t a 5-star product even at a low price point.  I’ll give it 2.5 stars and round up 3.  If you’re on a budget it’s serviceable, but you get what you pay for.\n",
      "4848->Feels and washes lovely - smells like MEN'S COLOGNE, though :( | 3 | 1 | This wash is luxurious.  Just a couple of pumps was all I needed for my shower.  The directions say to use your hand and rub in but I used a pouf and it worked well.  The foam really is luxurious and goes a long way.<br /><br />My problem is the very strong scent.  In no way does it smell like mint or rosemary (two scents that I LOVE!).  To me, it smells like a men's cologne.  In fact it smells just like this hand wash that a male friend keeps in his bathroom.  I think guys would probably like this very much - me, not really.  The scent is also VERY strong while using - like VERY.  The good news is that it leaves just the lightest scent on your cleansed skin - thank goodness.  Just very light.<br /><br />It left my skin clean and soft.  Too bad I really do not like the scent as I will likely not be using it again. : (  Sad too as I truly appreciate how it is clearly marked Vegan as that is important to me.

      "4849->Too Risky | 1 | 1 | Packaging was great, zero leaking. Smells quite manly, like men's deodorant. However, this is made in China, and though the conditioner looks pretty legit, the shampoo has 4 ingredients thought to be cancer causing.<br /><br />I got a promo deal so it was a great buy, though I'll have to throw away the shampoo, not worth the risk!<br /><br />Shampoo Ingredients<br />acrylates copolymer<br />Argania Spinosa (argan oil)<br />Betaine<br />carboxylate<br />cocamidopropyl<br />CocoGlucoside<br />Cocoyl taurate<br />Fragrance<br />Glyceryl Oleate<br />isethionate<br />lauryl glucoside<br />Phytokeratin<br />Polysorbate 20<br />Prunus Dulcis (almond oil)<br />Prunus Persica (peach kernel oil)<br />Pseudocollagen<br />sodium cocoyl<br />sodium cocoyl glutamate<br />Sodium lauroamphoacetate<br />Sodium Lauryl glucoside<br />Sodium Methyl<br />Jojoba oil, Camellia Seed Oil, Avocado Oil<br />Fragrance\n",
      "4850->Not practical - stains clothing | 2 | 1 | I love the fact that this is natural sunscreen, but it’s just not practical for regular use.  My biggest frustration was that the tint stains any fabric is comes in contact with & so you really can’t use it anywhere but your face.  It stained my bathing suit, baby’s bathing suit many other clothing items that brushed against my arm or leg.<br />I guess I should have known this would be an issue since zinc oxide doesn’t absorb in<br />Major bummer.  I still use it on my face though it’s really greasy feeling<br />Won’t buy more\n",
      "4859->Good starter kit. | 4 | 1 | Good starter kit. Definitely need some practice<br />to get them right but they look great once they are on. Unfortunately after a few uses lash started seperating from magnets. This more likely was my doing during the learning process.\n",
      "4868->Not Thick | 1 | 1 | It's just like a regular top coat except it peels off in 2-3 days.<br />Can't recommend this product\n",
      "4891->Ok for costuming, teens etc | 3 | 1 | My head measures about 22 1/2 around. On me the wig seemed to be on the small side. The hair is obviously fake as it is meant to be so so problem there, and it's a nice quality nylon or nylon type material. I love the colours.<br />It comes with a hair net,  2 wig caps, a pearl-type clip and a pair of druzy post earrings. The latter were a surprise and a pleasant one.<br />I had a hard time getting the wig to cover the very front section of my hair. I think anyone who has masses of hair, or really long hair may find this wig doesn't cover easily.<br />The hair hangs awkwardly. It falls forward into the face. I trimmed it a bit.<br />IMO this is a great wig for costuming and/or teens, but those with masses of long hair may find it problematic.\n",
      "4892->Doesn't do a thing for me | 1 | 1 | This is a very thin, clear oil.  It isn’t as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water.  I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.  Some people might be able to get away with it, but even though I have dry skin, my skin will break out if I put oil on it, so I have skipped that test.  I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.<br /><br />What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.<br /><br />I’ll stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.\n",
      "4896->ALMOST perfect! | 4 | 1 | I'm a lip gloss connoisseur and my favorite was this tube that looked like this one at a retailer that doesn't sell it anymore (MAN!) - it was sheer, tasted/smelled great and most importantly - was NOT sticky!  This is the closest I've found to it.<br /><br />PRO: The lip gloss smells and tastes great and it definitely helps with moisture and keeping lips soft. I like to put a little dab over lipstick so it has a tad bit of color.<br /><br />CON: It's a little sticky - just a tad. Also - the colors are meaningless because it doesn't add any color that I can tell.<br /><br />Verdict: Recommend - a very nice lip gloss<br /><br />I pride myself on honest, accurate, helpful reviews.\n",
      "4913->Big Bottle of Acetone-Based Nail Polish Remover | 5 | 1 | Like other nail polish removers, this MOUNTAIN FALLS REGULAR NAIL POLISH REMOVER (for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce) is mostly acetone.  It smells like all the other nail polish removers that I’ve tried, and works like them, too.<br /><br />I use nail polish remover to take gummy stuff off my hands and other things.  If you use it this way, it’s important to remember that it can damage synthetic fabrics, wood finishes, and plastic.  Also, when using or storing it, remember that it’s highly flammable, and should NOT be used or stored near fire, flames, or heat.  (See my photo of the bottle label, with all the warnings.)<br /><br />The big 16-oz. bottle is equivalent to two of the regular-size bottles (e.g., [[ASIN:B004X8IFEI Sally Hansen Nail Polish Remover]]) that you find at local grocery and drug stores.\n",
      "4919->Stylish short grey brown hair. | 4 | 1 | I really like the color blend of grey and brown. I believe it can be worn as is.<br />I made tighter curls on top and the bangs by using a small curling wand set on heat level #7. I also slightly trimmed around the ears and top for less grey to fit my face.\n",
      "4924->Loofah Pad. | 5 | 1 | These work great. Rough enough to get a deep clean, But soft enough not to scratch. The handy strap to fit your hand Makes it<br />very easy to use. Without it falling out of your hand. Plus a Little loop sewn on to hang it with.\n",
      "4929->I INSTANTLY felt like my whole face was so tight that I thought ... | 2 | 1 | So this product I left on my face for maybe 10 minutes and washed it off. I INSTANTLY felt like my whole face was so tight that I thought maybe I was just too stoned but no.... my face was straight up tight as hell......but then....the next day I noticed that my check was actually burned a bit. my whole face ruff the next day with dead skin which I thought to put a hydro sheet face mask the next day ( dr. Jart).<br />you skin is going to need alot of moisture and repair products for after but overall. I can see why they call it a peel<br />that shit peeled a layer off my face lol and my acne scars are kind of lighter. I might be careful with this next time I apply but over all....yeah sure it works.....it peels lol\n",
      "4941->Year ‘round great moisturizer! | 5 | 1 | Received this as Christmas gift and from the first use I loved it. The fragrance is a nice light natural scent. I love to smell it.<br />It is very creamy yet light to the touch and on the skin. It is all day and into the next day moisture. It absorbs easily into the<br />skin with no residue. When the bottle was near empty I found it here and have been stocking up ever since. I use it daily.\n",
      "4943->Not durable | 3 | 1 | Used once<br />Most of them cut\n",
      "4947->Not pure rice powder, HAS TALC | 1 | 1 | This is not pure rice powder. The main ingredient in this is talc. There is also a strong fragrance that smells similar to floral perfumes that were popular in the 1940's and 1950's. This is also not a fully translucent powder, if you are very pale this will look like your makeup has oxidized. Overall, I'm very unhappy with the ingredients in this and I think there could have been more transparency about the formula from the vendor.<br />I will say if you are looking for an old school setting powder this might work for you.  However, I would not recommend this for anyone who has sensitive skin or who is prone to acne.<br /><br />The full list of ingredients for this is: Talc, Calcium Carbonate. Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, and  May Contain Iron Oxides (C177491, C177492, C177499)\n",
      "4953->Not Sure if This is a Joke | 1 | 1 | I honestly don’t even know WHERE to begin with this review 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I have, in my lifetime – and, wearing “fake” nails for OVER 25 YEARS – NEVER seen this type of … idea 🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I’ll be as short as possible with this …<br /><br />Most anyone who hasn’t had an amputation, usually has 8 fingers and 2 thumbs – total of 10 “DIGITS” ✋🏻🤚🏻 And, in MOST cases – the nails are usually shaped the same.<br /><br />Thus, in a set of nails you’d need:<br /><br />💅🏻 2 – Thumb nails<br />💅🏻 2 – Index fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Middle fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Ring fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Pinkie fingernails<br /><br />I know – sounds almost silly or stupid to mention, but that’s math. Total “NAILS” needed: 10 … (“Luxury 12pcs press on nails kit comes with 10 different sizes which is pre-numbered 0-9 in a box” … “choose the most suitable size that fits you every finger”). Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we’re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I’ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you’ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails – 10 different sizes! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />Unlike the model hands – I don’t wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with – and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being “fake”, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular “nails” I’ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N’ Wild from the late 1980’s/early 1990’.<br /><br />What’s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I’ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep – they’re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I’d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price – I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn’t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.\n",
      "4977->Hinge is a bit touchy | 3 | 1 | These are tiny which is my fault for not paying attention to size. But besides that the quality is meh. They'll work for tiny bows for babies and toddlers. But the hinge on some of them broke and they fell apart easily.<br /><br />Size comparison with a big Clip in photos too\n",
      "4978->A Dozen bottles of Six shades NOT 72 assorted shades | 3 | 1 | Its says 72 assorted shades. What you get is 6 shades, a dozen of them each.<br />This needs to be clarified and changed. I dont need a dozen of each of the six shades they sent.<br />I was hoping for a lot of variety because of the pandemic and lack of funds i wont be visiting the nail salon anytime soon.<br />Only one bottle was damaged and the shipment came very promptly, earlier than the delivery date by almost a week.<br />Now to the colors and quality. I got a frosted salmon pink, a frosted champagne beige, a frosted dusty neutral rose. Three frosts. The cremes are a blue based red, classic, a traditional coral, classic, great for summer and when wearing grey or black or hunter green and a yellow that i havent tried yet.<br />So far Ive tried the pearl salmon pink, the coral and the pearl dusty rose.<br />You must use a base and top coat or these will wind up being very difficult to apply.<br />Once on they look really nice on short nails like mine and the polish actually does last and doesnt take too long to dry.<br />Ive been doing a mani pedi on my self once a week to try all the colors and they are growing on me. The colors are more on the traditional shades of polish you used to see in the 70s when there wasnt a whole lot to choose from like now.<br />These are Artmatic which used to produce a whole makeup line back in the day, inexpensive and good quality. It was that nostalgia that prompted me to order these and now i can say i am glad i did.\n",
      "4979->Just so so | 3 | 1 | I've been using this iron for a couple months now and it's okay as a flat iron but not very good as a curling iron. I wanted to use it as a curling iron, so it's not a good value for me. It leaves creases in my hair. I think if it had slightly rounded edges, it might be better... My regular flat iron curls better, I don't know if it's just because I have better control with my flat iron because I can hold the outside of it and twist it and use both hands of my hands, then adjust pressure and all that.<br />This iron you have to wear the heat protectant glove because it's hot all the way around and it makes it difficult to hold the iron with less tension, if that makes sense. So I find myself holding it a little tighter and then I have the creases. I really hoped it would work. I'll have to keep trying or buy a different iron.\n",
      "4985->it works | 4 | 1 | Works on dip powder.  I love dip powder, but removing it take so long and I don't like the acetone smell. I brought this item  to try after seeing it on both instagram & FB.  It works, but take some time.  I have to make sure to file down the top layer, take several applications and wait about 5 minutes each.  Polish come off.  This is much easier than the wrap finger nails in acetone soak cotton ball & foil.<br />Couple of pointers:<br />1. Make sure when applying, avoid the skin<br />2. File off the top coat layer will make the product work better<br />3. Wait at lease 5 minutes or longer\n",
      "4986->Smells terrible | 2 | 1 | function - same as any clay mask<br />Smell - DISGUSTING ! and the smell stays with you all night .<br />Even if your face looks good no one will want to get near you !<br /><br />The clear skin is likely a result of scrubbing to get this smell and dirt off your face !\n",
      "4987->First one had to be returned, 2d one perfect | 4 | 1 | The first clip just broke after a few uses and never felt solid.<br /><br />Overstock Outlet were great (though they needed a little nudging) and simply replaced the defective one.  The new one seems to work perfect. And sure holds a lot of hair.\n",
      "4995->Love the glitter! | 4 | 1 | This was my first experience with Incoco so I picked a color that would be less noticeable if I made mistakes. I'm glad I did.  The purple glitter was awesome - I couldn't stop looking at my nails!  I messed up a few nails at first and was able to stick some of the leftover polish strips on and you couldn't tell. I don't think I can do that with other patterns though, so I need to get good at this.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the polish at the tips of the nails wore off quickly (see attached photo).  The top edges of the nail wore off by day two but it wasn't too noticeable so I left it on as long as I could, which turned out to be about 1 1/2 weeks before the polish chipped.<br /><br />Will definitely buy again.\n",
      "4997->Pretty scent, silky feel. | 5 | 1 | I've tried many brands of purple shampoos/conditioners in the never-ending battle against brassy tones.<br />This is one of the better brands.<br /><br />First of all, I love the scent. It is vaguely floral, definitely a feminine scent. It smells wonderful in the shower, but I like the fact that it fades quickly once you rinse it away. It doesn't linger all day, meaning it won't compete with any other fragrance you are wearing.<br /><br />Second, I like the fact that this set is gentle, and non-drying. (Some other brands have left me with straw-like hair after a few uses.) This combo cleans gently, and leaves the hair feeling silky.<br /><br />Third, the toning is effective. There is a visible difference after just a couple of uses. I saw the yellow/orange tones had faded after the first use, and after the second, my hair was shiny and showed highlights, but there was a marked difference in the amount of brassiness.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the fact that the shampoo is natural (made with botanicals) and is sulfate and paraben free. It is also cruelty free, another big plus. The pump bottles are also great, making the shampoo and conditioner easy to use in the shower. They are plastic, so no breakage issues.<br /><br />Finally, the price is right. The shampoo and conditioner bottles each contain 16.9 fl. oz of product. A good buy.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid 5 star set. Recommended!\n",
      "4998->Overpowering and not environmentally friendly | 2 | 1 | I really wanted to love these. Especially in my clothing shop I thought I could include them in my packages as a sample.<br /><br />Until I opened one...<br />The packaging is eerily similar to an intimate product and looks really suspicious if you happen to pull one out of your bag in front of others.<br /><br />The scent is a very powerful vanilla citrus that doesn’t seem to dry down much. My boyfriend complained that the scent was overwhelming and smelled like “old lady” perfumes and asked me not to wear it.<br /><br />I also found the packaging to be wasteful, you can’t recycle any of it except for the box so if you do end up liking this sort of scent I would just buy the bottle instead.\n",
      "5001->Vivid Comics Color Will Have You Seeing Stars! | 3 | 1 | (BUDGET MANICURE TIP: Love Amazon though I do, at the moment regular brick-and-mortar stores have started pricing this special-edition line for clearance, making way for the impending influx of holiday merchandise. So, I picked up this set in a store elsewhere for $2.99 today. Now to the actual review...)<br />Although this polish duo is bright and up to Orly's usual high standards, this is still a basic, high-color product. That factored with the cost earned my 3 stars. Yet there was another polish in this special edition line that I would rate 4 stars in part because adorable yellow stars are included, along with blue polka dots,suspended in a red glitter polish. It's applied regularly, no special effort needed to get the special effects. I normally paint my nails with color only, as this duo provides, with no fancy decorations and bedazzling, and this set is fine for that. Yet I did prefer the red star polish, which Amazon unfortunately seems to have already sold out.It left my nails looking comic-book cool, as if I'd just delivered a Wonder Woman POW! to some evil villain! As a kid watching the series on Saturday-afternoon TV, I wanted to be Wonder Woman when I grew up. Since I'm lucky to carry off the Diana Prince look, these polishes help me channel my inner super heroine and tap some of that energy in a fun way!\n",
      "5006->Good value, except some of the pins aren't worth it. | 3 | 1 | These pins are a mixed bag. The double-tined pins are the best. Those pins are long and strong, with a touch of flexibility. One of these keeps my hair up and out of the way without snagging or pulling.<br /><br />The single pins, are also strong and flexible...just not very long. If you've got lots of thick curly hair as I do, it will take several strategically placed pins to keep things together.<br /><br />Finally some of the single pins have a raised design that runs the full length of the too-short pin. The problem is that the raised design catches at my hair and pulls.  You might get the pin in, and enough of them to hold your hair up, but it may come loose, carrying part of your hair with it, making it harder to reinsert. Intentionally pulling these pins out is just as bad.<br /><br />So if you are fine paying the total price for the double-tined pins in the collection, it's all good. If not, and your hair is fine with the shorter smooth pins, it's still good.<br /><br />I do not recommend using the pins with the full length design. Ouch.\n",
      "5013->What shimmer? | 2 | 1 | I was looking for an eye shadow with &#34;shimmer&#34; which is how this product was advertised<br />but it actually matte.  No shimmer at all.  The color is OK nothing special.  A lot of $ for<br />an eye shadow that does not do what it is advertised to do.\n",
      "5027->Not The Right Mud Mask For Me | 2 | 1 | The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays. My review will be updated if she has better results than I.<br /><br />--photo #1-taken right after I put some mask on my hand<br />--photo#2-taken after mask sat on my hand for 15 minutes (doesn't dry entirely)\n",
      "5043->It's the perks you are paying for ! | 3 | 1 | This Norelco shaving system is just that, a system!  That's what one pays for because the closeness of the razor is not near what the hand held manual razor can do.  We have used this, face for hubby, legs for me, and bottom line is the shave is not as close.<br /><br />There are great perks here!  The multi-purpose display is excellent, indicates how much time you have left before recharging and the time is plenty!  The storage case and charging stand are neat features.  But for the quick shave, you need to use it too long, going over and over!  It sure looks good though!  ...Rizzo\n",
      "5046->Eh, meh, nah. | 2 | 1 | I got these a month ago when I saw these featured on a YouTube hair video from a YouTuber I follow and generally, her advice on products is solid but these French pins?<br /><br />The IDEA/CONCEPT is simple and tried and true. So no way to really mess it up, right? Well...<br /><br />What I do like is the color and the paint or coding hasn't faded or chipped off. The slight curve allows for the in to rest against the curve of your head. The length is nice, and allows more versatility.<br /><br />What I don't like is the material. For $10 at Target, I wasn't expecting something industrial but the material is very, very flimsy and not remotely sturdy. Not only that, maybe it's the coating on the pins, these things don't stay in for long, or at all sometimes. I have fine, long hair and these pins won't stay put if I don't use product. I usually use a leave-in conditioner so that helps to create texture and the pins seem to stay in longer. These might work better with coarse, thicker hair. It's too bad the material isn't sturdier--so don't think you can do anything while wearing them. The minute you start anything other than sitting and look pretty for however long you wear them, they will fall out without even trying.  I had my hair half pined up with a barrette and then pulled the rest up in a twist and made sure the prongs were under the barrette so that it was more secure but it didn't even last half a day and I sit in a cubicle for 8 hours staring at a computer. Just getting up to get a cup of coffee or a printout from the copy machine or other basic tasks would easily loosen the pin.<br /><br />These are merely okay if you're doing absolutely nothing but sticking a pencil to keep your bun in place work just as well. It's too bad since they are pretty but these are not that functional.\n",
      "5064->Amazing and Hydrating | 5 | 1 | This is the first time using this product and I was pleasantly surprised. When I received the box the first thing I liked was the packaging. Adorable box with cute cartoons on it and the individual mask package is really nice as well.<br /><br />How I used it. First washed my face and dried it. Then gently took the lace mask out of the package and peeled the backing off. The mask is loaded with product on it and I didn't waste a bit and put excess from the bag on my hands and arms as well. I padded the mask down on my face and attached the part for you ears to secure it on your face. Then went to relax for the next 15-20min and enjoyed the feeling. When you take the mask off do not wash off the serum instead run it into your face.<br /><br />I've never used this brand before but I'm officially hooked! I've just turned 30 so I'm taking my skin care more seriously these days and very happy I found these masks. It's been a week since I've used it and my face is still feeling and looking great. I've started to purchase their other masks to see what I like best. I have nothing bad to say about this product it worked very well for me and I did notice a difference in my face. It also really liked the strap that goes under your chin. When I took it off it felt like it lifted and tightened my skin with still being extremely hydrated.<br />Try it, it's great.\n",

      "5076->As described! - NOPE NOT THE 2nd time around | 1 | 1 | *****Updates*****<br />I DID love my first bottle very much as you can see in the original review below. I bought the second bottle as soon as the first one ran low. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I dont know if this is a fake or the ingredients changed?! But:<br />1- The pump doesn’t go as smooth as the first one, feels clutchy and so some of the oil just squirts out and lands on the floor.<br />2- Oil feels much thicker on my face compared to the first bottle. I had no break in between the 2 bottles and I use this everyday morning and night so I can tell. The first bottle felt light and easy to rinse off, the oil from second bottle just sticks around on my face forever...<br />3- Im breaking out right now after first week of 2nd bottle, that didnt happen with 1st bottle, im guessing because i just couldn’t rinse all the oil off that’s why... Im looking for another brand now, can’t keep using this.<br />******************************<br /><br />I have never used cleansing oil before but my skin has been showing signs of aging lately so I watched a bunch of skin care youtube video to see what the ladies do these days, they all recommended cleansing oil before foam cleanser so I thought I would give this a shot. It did the job nicely! My skin doesn't feel tight or stretch or itchy after use at all, makeups are cleaned up well, and it actually felt very nice rubbing this oil on the face, I could open my eyes while using this, no burning at all! Using this and a water base gel cleanser definitely gives the \"baby face\" effect afterward ;)\n",
      "5077->So far so good! | 5 | 1 | I’m at day 4 and I do believe it’s working!<br />I have sensitive skin but this doesn’t irritate or make my skin dry at all.<br /><br />I have redness around cheeks and between my eyebrows and this certainly helps to reduce the redness.<br />I like it’s not sticky or oily and absorb into skin well.<br />I have to see how long my skin keeps less redness after 7 days.<br />I will update the review!\n",

      "5087->Product doesn’t say it is Vegan : ( | 4 | 1 | The listing says the product is Vegan but nowhere on the box or product does it state that.  I am not a scientist so am unsure if it truly is.  My experience – especially with most beauty products – is that if they are Vegan they definitely like to tout it on the product.  I am going to assume it is – but it should still say it clearly on it...<br /><br />It is black – so it is definitely “a look” for most people.  If you are goth or something – you will probably love it.  I got it mostly for Halloween.  Especially as it is matte – I can use it on my face as a whole to help with my costume– and not just on my lips.  It is easy to apply and actually applied VERY precisely.  If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.  Not terrible at all though.  It has a slightly vanilla like scent to it.  It is pretty nice.  It sort of stayed put but was also easy enough to wipe off with a paper towel and some pressure.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )\n",
      "5094->Great for an electric, but still doesn't compare to fusion razor | 3 | 1 | I gave this to my husband, hoping he would get hooked by even the novelty of it and use it everyday, I like a freshly clean shaven look on him and he had been slacking lately using his fusion disposables.<br /><br />He's tried a few electric razors in the past but was never happy with them so has stuck to using the upper end disposables.<br /><br />His take: very comfortable to hold, the heads conform to his face well and it's a comfortable shave... as long as it's very lubricated. He found he got the best feeling and closest share only when he used a lot of shaving creme/gel & had his face very well, making for quite a mess on the sink top. He liked the idea of the dispensing lotion but found he preferred his normal shaving gel and also didn't think the dispenser held enough or that it was cost effective. On the upside this is water proof so I'll get him to try it in the shower next. He also agrees with the other reviewers who said it's just not a close enough shave, and that it takes far to long. The whole idea of a electric is to speed up the process but between loading it with the conditioner, using it, adding more water, cleaning up the mess etc it was taking him 2x as long to shave at least, and with less steller results.<br /><br />My take: I think his face looks better, the shave may not be as close however there are no knicks or aggrivation and his skin looks better all around. Of course I see his point on the time consuming aspect.<br /><br />The booklet recommends giving it 3 weeks, I'm not sure I'll be able to talk him into that... wonder how this thing would work on my legs? ;)\n",
      "5110->Difficult to accurately give stars, varying quality and color accuracy. | 2 | 1 | The green shimmer is A+, gorgeous color, not too thick or thin, great opacity (2 thin coats).<br /><br />The spring green is brighter than represented, almost a lime. It's also thin, very low opacity, and turned yellow at the ends of my nails after roughly 3 weeks. It also chipped a bit in three weeks, on toenails.<br /><br />The smokey lavender is actually just a slightly lavender-toned medium gray. The dark blue is actually just a blue-toned medium gray. The blue-gray is just neutral gray. The colors in the swatches are NOT accurate for those three shades. The formula is good, the colors are just off. This isn't due to the difference between displays, either.<br /><br />I haven't tried the olive yet. It is, at least, fairly color accurate.<br /><br />I love the green shimmer, and do like the grays. I can use the lime green, and the olive will probably be serviceable. But part of the point of this purchase was to have a smokey lavender and a dark blue, and I don't. So I'll have to spend more to get them. Disappointed.\n",
      "5138->No more plastic bottles! | 3 | 1 | The number one thing I like about this product is that it does not come in a plastic bottle. It’s packaged in a recyclable cardboard box.<br /><br />Upon first opening the box the scent was a little overpowering for me, very natural woody smell. I was concerned it would leave my hair smelling too strongly. But to my surprise I really liked the scent while in the shower and it did not leave a strong scent in my hair once dried. I like that you can use the bar only where extra conditioning is needed, like on the ends of the hair, and skip the scalp. It didn’t seem to be as moisturizing as some traditional liquid conditioners I’ve used, but it gets the job done and doesn’t leave a grimy feel on the hair.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this product is that the first two ingredients are alcohol. Alcohol is drying. So it just seems a little counterproductive to use alcohol as the first two ingredients in a moisturizing conditioner.<br /><br />Overall I do enjoy this product and I would recommend for daily use!\n",
      "5139->Ok | 3 | 1 | Smaller than I thpught they would be. Came earlier than it said. Exactly like picture.<br /><br />WARNING when i first got them i thpught there were a lot less gold than the picture suggests and that they were mixed with some silver, but when i dumpped the gold compartments out to separate them it turns out the bottoms are all silver.  So don't do what i did.<br /><br />No  messes. All good.  The reason for the three stars is that some of them are bent and you cannot apply them vwry easily on your nail. Plus not having some type of glue made it harder. I think it would be better if they included some application glue. Maybe a little too pricey with out glue.\n",

      "5144->Buy it just if you like the Parfum bottle! | 1 | 1 | I just want to give one star for the bottle! It is gorgeous!<br />But unfortunately, I do not have the same words and enough stars for the Eau de Parfum scent.<br />I almost threw up when I sprayed it up in the air.  My quick fix:  I simply tossed everything away! Better this way.\n",
      "5193->Hmmm... | 3 | 1 | These were cute. But like all falsies I get that have designs on them, I added a top coat to preserve the design. If not, the design will rub off easily. Be careful though. The top coat affected the paint layer on top and made it wrinkle.<br />These were stronger than the previous set I got. Would I order them again? Sure.\n",
      "5199->Great purchase | 5 | 1 | Great purchase! Arrived quickly and safely! Would recommend to anyone!<br />I use daily and love it. I have very dry spots but also very oily areas and this helps a lot with dry areas and does not make me any Oiler\n",
      "5202->Comparable to Tweezerman, nice colors | 5 | 1 | With 4 women in the house we're losing track of tweezers ALL THE FRICKING TIME!  The kids leave them on their beds or messy desks where they end up under their clothes or books, next thing you know they are off to the parent's room to take ours.<br /><br />We've purchased at least 3 or 4 pairs of Tweezerman tweezers and am glad to say that these are comparable in quality, but not as expensive.  The color is nice so you can find them more easily.<br /><br />We've taken to putting flourescent yellow duct tape on ours so the kids won't take them and so we can find them immediately.  Stupid, but it works.\n",

      "5217->doubled in cost from May until Sept 1 | 1 | 1 | Who is price gouging here? The manufacturer or the distributor?<br /><br />This is a great product, but I can't see buying it anymore if it doubles in price between orders of just a few months!<br /><br />Amazon really needs to stop this profiteering, or I'll have to buy locally.\n",
      "5220->Probably not for me. | 3 | 1 | I probably made a mistake by ordering this product--but that isn't the fault of the product.  I was looking for glycerin to add to some shaving soap that isn't quite lubricating enough for my taste.  As I use mostly unscented products, I thought the rosewater might be a nice addition.  Clearly I was taking a risk.<br /><br />Well the scent isn't my cup-o-tea, but mostly I found this isn't really a glycerin you would add to a lather.  It really is a post-shave product.  So with that in mind, it is probably OK--maybe better.  But it isn't for me.\n",
      "5229->Many compliments | 5 | 1 | I cannot tell you how many compliments I have gotten from wearing this fragrance.  Everybody loves it.  Please note it is a strong, noticeable fragrance - nothing subtle about this.  So only get it if you don't mind waking up any room when you walk in.<br />Love it!!\n",
      "5234->Hair bands | 4 | 1 | Arrived quickly. Seemed to be well made, although a bit on the snug side even on my daughter who has a very small head size. The colors were much more muted, not bright or vibrant like I had expected and hoped for.<br />Will still probably keep them and use as long as she can tolerate the snugness. Edit to add, after trying on myself, they are snug enough to give me a headache. Probably better for a child size. But all in all, they are nice and good price for six of them.\n",

      "5255->Good deal to try Olaplex but …… | 3 | 1 | This kit is a perfect way to try the OlaPlex line, which may work for you, but I wasn’t impressed with it after using for awhile. The products worked well when I first stared and had just colored my hair but it got very dry,  like too much protein after a while and very weighted down- a lot of them contain silicone so read the labels.<br />I have fine bleached curly hair.  I much prefer K18 it just is so much better for my type of hair.\n",

      "5279->A Surreal Dreamy Experience – Say Goodbye to Anxiety and Hello to Confidence! | 5 | 1 | Today I tried out Liquid Trust for the first time. I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "5288->This set of loofah scrubbers is the best I have ever gotten | 5 | 1 | This set of loofah scrubbers is the best I have ever gotten. I didn't expect them to be so big and nice but I am really pleased with how nice they are. They are good quality and full not flimsy so they don't fall apart. They are well made and very nice and strong. They are long enough to really get my back easily while I am in the shower. This is a huge set of five sponges they will last a. Ice long time. The colors are nice and bright and the handles are attached well so I can hang them to dry with no worries. This is a great set I am glad I was able to get them.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "5293->Fancy Flair | 4 | 1 | This is a very comfortable headband, it does not have any under grip however and does slip a little. But, it's worth the minor adjustments when wearing.<br />Very sparkly, this gives off everyday princess vibes. Plenty of color to match just about anything, and arrived without any missing crystals or pokey spots,<br />Well made and pretty!!\n",

It wraps into your natural hair and it pulls. For those of us with thin hair, this is a horrible experience.<br /><br />The comb on the inside actually pulls hard on the ponytail, and the extension clips would serve better to hold without causing a pulling of natural hair.<br /><br />I will have to figure a way to remove the velcro and the comb to put in place a better way to Velcro attach and use two extension clips instead of the 4 prong comb.\n",

      "5345->Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid | 4 | 1 | I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\n",

      "5383->DIY Clay Mask Skincare Kit | 4 | 1 | This is a DIY clay mask kit that could use better branded packaging. It comes in a generic box with everything tossed into it, which makes it feel like a random assortment of products rather than a unified kit. It includes two different but reputable brands (Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and an Indian Clay Mask) as well as an assortment of mixing supplies (pink bowl, measuring spoons, spatula, brush). The pink plastic supplies are dollar quality and feel very cheap while the ACV and clay mask are full size products that can be used together as indicated on the DIY recipe or on their own. The mask jar doesn't specify that ACV must be used so I assume you can use it on your own or have it diluted with water. The ACV can be used for many other applications including drinking for general health.<br /><br />Overall I like the quality of the two products - the other supplies felt unnecessary and extraneous, but I guess you can charge more by including them. But I'd rather just use my own bowls. Overall it's a good quality kit and it gives you a nice at-home facial. I tried it once and my skin does look brighter than usual. However, they warn you not to leave it on for more than 5-10 minutes as it can irritate your skin.\n",
      "5391->Overall, the gold “unicorn horn” design is very, ... | 2 | 1 | Overall, the gold “unicorn horn” design is very, very cute and the pink bristles are soft to the touch. However, the hairs seem sparse and do not keep their shape well and the plastic of the handles are flimsy and feel as though they may break if handled too roughly. There is a wide range of different brushes offered in this pack but several of them seem to be just duplicates of each other (perhaps this was just a packaging mistake?).<br />You get what you pay for when it comes to makeup brushes and this is definitely the case here.<br />Given all of this information I still don’t regret getting them as I expected all of this upon purchasing.\n",
      "5395->Not bad | 4 | 1 | Usually I am not happy with foam soap. But this one is pretty good. I think I would buy it again if it weren't for the high cost. I know that I can make my own foam soap just by using this container. So I will probably end up doing that as opposed to paying another five dollars for the small bottle.<br /><br />The smell is fine. It is not overbearing at all. Which makes me happy. And it's a good smell.<br /><br />One thing that I will note. When you're reusing a bottle to make your own foam soap once in a while you're going to have to take it a part and actually wash it out because it will stick. So instead of buying a new one just take the parts apart and keep it going.\n",

Creme was all over the inside of the package and so of course I got it all over when I opened the package. Didn't even think about taking a photo of the jar because, without thinking, I washed my hands and wiped the jar down.<br /><br />Will come back and annotate my review when I use the product on my curly hair.\n",
      "5465->FINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses | 5 | 1 | I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.\n",

      "5486->I was charged more than the price offered by Amazon | 1 | 1 | I recently bought this lipliner,it's really good but........ the price they charged me was the full price instead of the discount  offered by Amazon.I sent them (the seller)a letter and the answer was that I was wrong , they charged me the correct price and that I was mistaken.<br />Well, they lost a client, there is no responsability either from Amazon,I wrote to them and they never answered back.<br />The price listed is $9.11 and I was charged $11, I would like to know how can that happen and if Amazon can solve this matter.Very disappointed.\n",
      "5491->Broke out my face but fixed my ezcema! | 4 | 1 | I use retanoids, AHAs and vitamin c serum so ceramides go nicely in my routine and my skin really appreciates them. Im on the look out for a new ceramide based cream so I hoped this would fit the bill.<br />It is a thick white cream with no odour, spreads easily and feels nourishing on the skin without being too greasy.<br />On my face it sadly broke me out. But on my hands where I have eczema, It was a miracle cute! No steroid cream has helped nearly as much. I'm really happy I found my new favorite hand Cream shame it didn't work for my face!!\n",
      "5532->Really enjoy it, but expensive | 4 | 1 | Pros:<br />- Great Smelling<br />- Really does &#34;smooth&#34; when applied to the private area<br />- a little amount will go a long way<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Expensive<br />- Small container<br />- no amazon prime shipping<br /><br />Overall:<br />I really enjoy this product, I use it mainly on my private regions for when I want to clean up smoothly down there.  I would definitely buy it again if it was priced slightly lower and didnt cost another 33% for shipping costs.<br />I think they were being a little too marketing aggresive with the ingrown hair solution as that seems to be the reason for the lower star reviews.  But if you are looking for a refreshing / after shave lotion, this is it.\n",
      "5562->Heavy scent for sensitive noses -  Shake Your Coconuts | 2 | 1 | I am NOT rating on the performance of the product as I cannot use it. From the reviews and description I di dnot think the scent would be overpowering; I was wrong.<br />The minute I opened the Amazon package my eyes started tearing up and when I took it out, it was even worse.<br />Since it is not worth it to return, I will give it a friend of mine but wanted to write a review for those like me who have bionic noses....\n",
      "5575->This is neither moisturizing not the color shown in two places. | 1 | 1 | I use Burt's Bees lip balm on my lips during the day, even after putting on lipstick which has never stayed on my very dry lips.  Since using that product, chapped lips are a thing of the past.  But this was a great disappointment.  I can't remember where I read about it and it said it was extremely moisturizing. This was actually drying and to add insult to injury, it wasn't even near the color it shows on the website.<br />My hope was to find something as good as the lip balm that would actually have a bit of color but this isn't the way to do it.  I'll just toss it because it isn't even as moisturizing as my regular lipstick!\n",
      "5576->Cute and Handy | 4 | 1 | Definitely a time-saver...<br /><br />I just wish these lasted longer for the price.<br /><br />They’re pretty great - good color, smudge-proof, and make brows look way more natural.\n",

      "5618->Product packaging concerns | 3 | 1 | The name “Honey Bee Smooth Bath & Body Scrub + Moisturizer” just evokes good thoughts, doesn’t it? If you love honey, it just sounds amazing. I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br /><br />There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I’m not going to dispute that and it’s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me – quality control especially.<br /><br />The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I’d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don’t know and that doesn’t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I’m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn’t mean that it can’t be contaminated by anything else -1) it’s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who’s to say that someone couldn’t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label – the one I mentioned with their website URL – if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br /><br />“This webpage is not available<br /><br />ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED”<br /><br />I don’t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br /><br />ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product…<br /><br />When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary — the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it’s honey, it’s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br /><br />It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn’t expect that it wouldn’t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good – I used it on my leg.<br /><br />It’s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you’re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br /><br />I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4. This product was given to me complimentary in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "5619->12 supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes with cleaner/holder | 5 | 1 | There are 12  supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set with a silicone brush head cleanerbrush that doubles as a mini-brush holder. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />This is an attractive brush set in matte black. Unfortunately, the color of the silicone cleaner cannot be chosen. I thought I was going to get purple to match with my purple bathroom and I received a pink one.  <br /><br />The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel fantastic against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. The only thing to note is that because the bristles are super soft, these brushes are more suited for powder applications than cream or liquid.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this quality set as it comes to $1.67 per brush or $1.54 per item if counting the silicone cleaner.\n",
      "5624->Polyester, not Satin! | 4 | 1 | I bought this for my Husband as he has lost the du rag that he had. He was happy! So the material is not of a satin feel. Its more of a polyester. It is lightweight though. It is not see through either.<br /><br />Aa for the tail at the back. It is not long like it has shown in the picture on the package. Thats a good thing for me and him as I do not like the long tail. The tail came just past the back of his neck. Not even past his shoulders.<br /><br />It seems good enough so far for the price of the product.\n",
      "5627->Nice kit for men | 4 | 1 | My husband put this kit to good use so I asked him if he'd mind letting me know what he thought about it. He didn't mind at all and this is what he had to say:<br /><br />\"Very comprehensive, quality kit for men. If you're like me you will find there are items in here that you likely won't really need. I personally don't use hair pomade or those light shave creams. I prefer foam and my hair just sort of keeps my head warm.<br />Aside from the items I can't use there are some great items in here for everyone. The body scrub soap like and feel a good bit more fresh after using it. But my preference, and where I really came to appreciate this, was with the facial moisturizer and lip balm. I don't usually buy those items and let the winter have its way with my face. I ride a bike everyday. But using the items in this kit really helped me keep my skin from drying, and my lips. The lip balm tastes and smells great, too.\"<br /><br />That's what he had to say about it. He did genuinely seem to enjoy using this kit.\n",
      "5637->This is not the original Spa's Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask | 1 | 1 | This has the same ingredients as Spa's Premium but they are watering it down.  The first ingredient is water!!!  When adding water, it will dry out your skin!  Spa's Premium ingredients list:  Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum.<br /><br />Plus these new masks are telling you to add a thick layer so you will use more of the product faster.  Spa's premium tells you to put a thin layer.  My daughter has horribly dry acne/rosacea skin and the Spa's Premium never dried out her skin.  I would rather them not have water but instead use Apple cider vinegar but Spa's premium is the only one that has a small amount of water.\n",
      "5640->Not for use on a normal adult size head. | 2 | 1 | I have a standard size head.  You would have to be 12 years old to get this over your hair and to fit comfortably. I do have thick hair down to my shoulders. The opening is TOO SMALL. The ties are fashionable but useless because you can’t get them to stay on your head as pictured.<br />I’m glad they didn’t cost much because I am putting them in the trash.\n",
      "5646->Amazing Product | 5 | 1 | Shaving snobs look elsewhere.  For the rest of us, this is one fine product.  I use it when I travel, without a brush.  I rub it over my wet beard after shower and work it in with my fingers.  There is more than enough lubrcating power for 2-3 passes.  I was orginally looking for something to replace my now discontinued Irisch Moos.  I tried several and concluded that this one may even be better.<br /><br />I understand some complain about the smell. Are you kidding me?  Nice light citrus scent.  My only complaint is the cheap wrapper.  The Irisch Moos had a substantial plastic case.  This is wrapped in thin tin foil.<br /><br />For $4, Arko should be in every wet shavers rotation.  Amazing product.\n",
      "5653->It contains alcohol. Does not moisturize | 2 | 1 | Drying. I wish I would have looked closer at the list of ingredients. It touts itself as being a natural shampoo, free of most of the bad ingredients I try hard to avoid. I just assumed that meant alcohol too.<br />But you know what they say. When you assume something it makes an a.. out of u and me.\n",
      "5662->Not moisturizing enough for me | 4 | 1 | I live in a very dry area and my hair needs lots of moisturizing. Although I like the idea of conditioner without the plastic bottle, this does not work for my hair. I need more moisturizing than this conditioner provides. I also did not much like the smell, but it did not make me sneeze like many other conditioners with a strong scent.<br /><br />Mixing it up takes a bit of patience. You start stirring around these chunks in water and wonder if this is going to work. Keep stirring, it does work, you do get a creamy conditioner. It makes me wonder how much fuel we could save if we shipped all conditioners, shampoo, etc. without the water.\n",
      "5669->Super scratchy bristles. | 2 | 1 | It’s described as having a COOL setting, NO it’s actually a Warm setting, at high Force<br />Medium setting is Low force and Hot<br />High setting is High force and Hot<br /><br />The thin 1.5 “ brush has terribly scratchy rough bristles! Not good for hair or scalp<br />The Big brush has tipped bristles and is oval shaped, looks like it would straighten hair.<br /><br />The entire item is lightweight& easy to grasp. 1000 watts of dryer power.\n",
      "5687->too scented | 3 | 1 | I have very sensitive facial skin and cannot tolerate perfumed face products. This cream has a scent to it and made my face itch. I will use it as general moisturizer--just not on my face.<br />It is fairly thin cream and spreads easily. At first I thought it was leaving a greasy trail but this disappeared as the cream was absorbed. A bit pricey for the amount you get.\n",
      "5693->quick shipment, just as I expected, works great | 5 | 1 | I purchased as a gift for my son who just went off to college, so I dont have personal experience with it, but he says it works great.<br />Wife uses the rechargeable model, and wanted me to get that for him, but she has worn a couple out over the years (battery stops charging), so I opted for the less expensive model that uses AA batteries.  I had an extra AA wall charger and lots of rechargeable AA batteries so I threw that in his &#34;care package&#34; and he says it works fine.<br />I also use a Braun toothbrush that takes AA's and I use rechargeable AA's in it and it is great.  Never have to throw it away because of a bad battery.\n",
      "5694->Kit is good Minus the polygel | 3 | 1 | Everything this comes with is perfect UNLESS we are going to talk about the polygel. It won’t stick to my nail. It won’t harden. I’ve cooked it for 5 minutes and it’s still soft in some areas. Then there’s trying to use the right monomer. I even used alcohol and it helps move it around but then won’t stick. I less monomer and it sticks to the brush. I won’t say I’m a professional but I can do my nails and have them come out decent.<br />Oh and I only got 2 tubes of polygel when it’s suppose to come with 3.\n",
      "5697->Nice cream, gimmicky packaging | 4 | 1 | When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.\n",
      "5698->skip this mirror | 1 | 1 | I bought this mirror for my mother, it worked great until I had to change the batteries.<br />When I put brand new batteries in the base, the mirror will not come on.<br />It will work when you use the adapter, but the only reason I bought this expensive mirror is that it was battery operated.\n",
      "5702->Argan Oil shampoo/conditioner set | 2 | 1 | EDIT:<br />Come to find out the softness came from my heat protection product, not this set. I used on my daughter's hair and it strips it so much it matted overnight. I didn't have that problem, but I put oils in after the shower. Would return if I could... Going with OGX since it's the same price :/<br />****<br /><br />The &#34;freshness&#34; seal on the shampoo was loose and has the thick consistency of gelatin rather than a cream or lotion. I also expected the conditioner to have a nicer smell, though it doesn't smell BAD, per se.<br /><br />That being said, my highlight treated, heat styled hair is softer after only a couple uses. I do still have to use a heat protection product, but that is typical in my experience.\n",
      "5703->Holds lots of make up and doesn't take up much space | 4 | 1 | I got this to help organize make up on top of our dressers and it does a fine job of that.<br /><br />Quality: The organizer is made of plastic with rubber on top and the mirror comes apart from the set and then is used to clover the middle sections. The mirror is not on a hinge and only just slides into a slot when you want to use it, I would have liked for it to attach more securely or to be on a hinge instead.<br /><br />How does it work? It allows you to push lipsticks and other cosmetics into rubber X shaped holes that hold the make up in place standing up. On the other side you can lay make up across divided rubber slots and in the middle there are bigger sections to hold a compact or other make up. It works well, the mirror comes off the organizer and slides into a slot to stand up and be used.<br /><br />Overall, this is a compact and nice organizer for the top of any dresser or table. The only con is the mirror could have been built in a better way to attach it to the organizer more securely.\n",
      "5713->Great product. | 1 | 1 | I hope this review gets printed. I've noticed they've refused to publish constructive criticisms.<br /><br />This hair is crappy and advertising is fake.<br />1. It is very short, shorter than the listed measurements.<br />2. I am from the Caribbean and have seen dry coconuts in its raw form. The hair feels like the husk of coconuts.<br />3. The quantity is also false, they took one pack and divided it Into two.<br /><br />In a nutshell, save your $$<br />PS. I chose that Deceptive caption in hopes my review gets published.\n",
      "5715->Spray quit sprayin | 1 | 1 | About 1/2 way through my 2nd bottle it would not spray. Absolutely nothing. I ran hit wster cleaned everything. NOTHING<br />I wrote company.

I have not heard from the company again and I received nothing\n",
      "5717->Ghost makeup | 4 | 1 | This is very White. I am pale and this makes me look like a clown.  Also there isn't much product in the compact.  It does go on sheer but you can see the dryness in my skin and it's not a good look. On the plus side it has a light smell that dissipates quickly.<br /><br />Edit:  I figured out that I can add drops of dinair C117 airbrushing fluid to this to correct the color.  Not sure if that's kosher but the color looks much better on me now.\n",
      "5718->I'm a dude and these are pretty good | 4 | 1 | I don't know anything about the other reviews that talk about the original Salux from Japan versus impostors from China.  I've never owned a product like this before.  I am male and have sensitive skin that's prone to irritation that results in random pores getting clogged on my arms or chest or legs.  I bought these on a recommendation to test out and see if they helped.  I've only had them for a few days, and can't really say yet if they've done anything for my pores or not, but they do seem to be doing a really good job at exfoliating my skin.<br /><br />The individual towels are roughly 12 inches wide by 24 or 30 inches long.  They're made of some sort of woven nylon or plastic material that is kind of wavy and extremely abrasive when rubbed across the skin.  You use the towel by putting a dollop of liquid soap onto it and then rubbing it onto your body to create a lather.  The towel is long enough that you can easily scrub your back by holding the ends of the towel and pulling back and forth.  The towels are abrasive enough that it really feels like you're scraping a layer of skin off.  Probably not appropriate for use anywhere sensitive.<br /><br />I'm loving these so far.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "5739->Good for beginners | 2 | 1 | This product is just okay.  For me to contour I had to keep building up the color because when I would blend the color would disappear.  My dark circles are not that bad but I felt like I could not get the product to conceal completely.  I do not feel like the pigments of this palette held up.  It needs to be set with powder.  An expert makeup artist would not use this palette but, is good if you are just starting out.<br />*Sample provided\n",
      "5750->Don't purchase! | 1 | 1 | This stuff was awful.  I thought it would be an easier way to do my nails, but it never set under the UV light. The gel was too thick to spread with the \"slider\" stuff.  The gel didn't adhere to my nails using the molds, leaving a huge gap between my nail and the poly coating.  I wound up just peeling the stuff off, even after 5 rounds of 90 second UV for each round of the process.<br /><br />I do not recommend.\n",
      "5767->This foundation produces nice matte finish | 4 | 1 | This foundation produces nice matte finish. Moisturizes skin, not greasy and does not emphasize winkles.<br />Also it is sun block which makes it most useful on sunny days.\n",
      "5768->love the idea, but not the execution | 2 | 1 | I wanted to like this because i love the idea of messy art projects contained to the bath and like that the paint is actually soap, so it comes off easily.  Below are my problems:<br /><br />1) While it is a variety of colors, I got two robins egg blue, a red, and a green.  Wish I would have received 4 colors instead of 3.<br />2) The paint is very running and comes out really fast.  If it were thicker, it would be easier to paint with.<br />3) The paint is actually very sheer so you need a lot of it to show up on the bath walls.\n",
      "5772->Worth getting on sale, good feel but, doesn’t hold blades tight | 3 | 1 | I like the feel in the hand BUT I have multiple brands of blades and they do not sit tight in this razor. Also it has a plastic set screw that always comes loose :/.<br /><br />If this held the blade tightly then I probably would have given 4 stars\n",

KEEP LOOKING!!!<br />I never buy straight hair, but decided to try it.. this hair was so thin I had to cut half of it off to make it look decent. I even added extra tracks. I had so many tracks in my head and still had a stingy ponytail..  I washed this hair out my head 5 days later because it was so bad...<br /><br />This hair doesn't have a smell at all. I co-washed it NO nasty brown chemical...<br />It DOES SHED VERY BAD..<br />Its definitely not 10a\n",
      "5789->Great Product Unless You Have To Return It | 3 | 1 | This is by far the best nail polish I have ever used. I will continue to use it exclusively.<br /><br />I ordered Beloved Blush and the color is not at all what I expected. I didn't pay any attention to the return policy since I was so confident with the product. Now I'm out $20 bucks and stuck with I color that doesn't work for me.<br /><br />DARN!!\n",
      "5793->Could be improved.... | 4 | 1 | It was a beautiful unique set. The plates, cups, straws, and banner were beautiful and didn’t feel cheap. I really love that it came with spoons, fork, and knives. The poofs and fans were a good size.<br />However, I was a bit disappointed that the color scheme did not match exactly. The plates were more of a peachy/coral  but the trim of napkins, straws, banner, etc  were  pink. The table cover was very thin and felt cheap. I also don’t understand that if the set is for 16 guest but only includes one table cover. (I ended up just buying extra white covers). I also wish this set came with matching goody bags. The latex balloons were great colors but I had 4 pop as they were getting filled. I had to buy extra to make up for them.\n",

      "5807->My aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. | 4 | 1 | Even though I am not fond of the paper masks (prefer collagen), there is no denying they work well and my aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

      "5808->Poorly Made Product | 1 | 1 | This product, after less than 6 weeks of normal use, started coming apart.  The seam at the bottom of the large part of the pillow came apart under normal use.  This is, obviously, a poorly made product and I would not recommend purchasing it.  I bought this for my wife and she is not pleased; to make matters worse it started coming apart just after the 30 day return period had expired.<br /><br />Russell J. Sepielli\n",
      "5811->My dog is scared of this brush | 3 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:9199d3273831fd355e334d1c655a5b0c]] This brush reminds me of a detatching tool or rack that you use to pull up your garden weeds. The end points on the brush are on the sharp side and you need to be extremely gentle on your furry friend when using this brush. It is blunt, but if you push too hard, it will break their skin.<br /><br />I have a small Pomeranian dog and he doesn’t like this comb at all since he has sensitive skin and he doesn’t like the raw (cold) metal rubbing against his skin. He runs away from me now when he sees me pulling this comb out.<br /><br />The only time that I was able to use the comb on him, I was able to comb out his knots and remove the excess fur/hair. It was a chore, but it does work.<br /><br />This comb will work best for larger breed dogs with thicker fur/hair.\n",

      "5828->Great bands for hair | 4 | 1 | Great bands for hair.  The are easier on the hair than standard rubber bands.  However if you have super thick hair these may not work for you.  These are very nice and colorful and work well in thinneer hair.<br />I have no complaints with these hair ties.<br />They work as they should<br />I received a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using myself.\n",
      "5846->The outer packaging is very nice! But once opened | 4 | 1 | I did not expect this to be a brick of shea that I would need to process somehow to make a usable product. Now I'm not entirely sure what I am going to do with it. I guess I'll have to go online and find some recipes for it and whip something up. There is a website address on the flyer included in the package.<br /><br />The outer packaging is very nice! But once opened, the actual block of shea butter is in a common zip baggie. Unimpressive. It does have an &#34;earthy aroma&#34; as stated on the flyer. Not unpleasant, but a bit too strong for my nose. I'm one notch under neutral on the scent.\n",
      "5859->Great color | 5 | 1 | I’ve tried nearly every sunless tanner on the market; this is one of the best out there right now.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Color develops quickly<br />-It won’t streak or seep into your pores (a lot of new formulas gather in the pores creating a freckled appearance)<br />-Not greasy<br />-Provides a natural looking color<br />-Fades gradually\n",
      "5865->Doesn’t moisturize - Smells Awful | 1 | 1 | I’ve been slowly switching to all organic & natural products and I have been eyeing a couple of products from Captain Blankenship for a while. I was super excited when I finally placed my order however both of the products I purchased from this brand are a major fail. What’s with all the great reviews and popularity? I really don’t know.<br /><br />1. Effectiveness in Moisturizing: pretty much none because it’s very lightweight and goes on almost watery. Score: 0/5.<br />2. Time it lasts: it’s pretty thin/liquidy once you put it on so it comes right off. Again 0/5.<br />3. Tint/Stain on lips: it does stain lips but it’s fairly temporary again due to its consistency. It’s maybe a 2 or 3 out of 5.<br />4. Smell: oh dear lord. It smells awful like chemicals & strong herbs mixed together (I’m not implying that it has chemicals but the smell is just way way off). Definitely 0/5.<br />5. Overall: 0/5 because I would give #1 and #4 negative points if I could.\n",
      "5874->They're okay. | 3 | 1 | I have owned these four months. The brushes themselves do the job well. The quality is lacking. The handles have all started coming off, and i've been having to glue them on. While I appreciate the blending they have done, I think I'll be buying a different, better set.<br /><br />Decent for the money. Add superglue to your cart, too.\n",
      "5876->color is natural, color is #2 on all pics | 5 | 1 | I have several X-tress/Soku wigs.<br /><br />This is a machine made part. There is no lace to cut.<br />This is a Synthetic hair wig. It has beautiful luster.<br />No fake shiny<br />No odor<br />Cap is well constructed, no funky, no wefts showing, no wefts breaking, no tearing<br /><br />In this particular \" model\" of X-tress as described<br />*** there is Zero Combs ***<br />I wear my wig grip with my wig cap and it is Good. No movement.<br />I am not worried at all. The cap is average, it is not considered small.<br />It isn't a cap swimming on my head.<br /><br /> My measurement is 21.5 inches. My natural hair is close to the scalp, clipper Pixie.<br />Nothing in the way basically and this wig suits me perfect ( add wig grip and cap)<br /><br />This #2 is with a darkest of brown cast. This how and why I love Soku / X-tress<br />they achieve natural color with their hair in tone and hue. I am never left with<br />a giant sigh .. why is it sooooo black, not once.<br /><br />Not even with my \" 1B\" purchase. There is still a hue of darkest brown within the darkest of tones.<br /><br />Nothing worse than a Witchy Halloween Black Root with an Ombre,<br />and or overt costume black for an everyday wig, it's unwearable.<br /><br />I do not know anyone who has Over-dyed Crayola black hair do you?<br /><br />The parting space has a small linear band like area, across that is alike lace front, a little over a centimetre.<br />This where you can do, if you chose to, use spray or gel, for extra security.<br />This wig has density. It is not thin. It may thin out towards the bottom.<br />However from scalp to 24 inches, You've got a lot of Hair. It's NOT WIGGY.<br />I have not altered this wig in any of the photos, other than the lopping off the length.<br />I did not use thinning shears on Her.<br /><br />I use a Mannequin Head, I assess and then use my Wahl Clippers and lop off the bottom, slowly.<br />28 inches is great, you can then alter the wig to different lengths, before it's been loved too much, unable to wear.\n",
      "5896->AMAZING. | 5 | 1 | Love this stuff! I use it for everything. Chapped lips, chapped skin (especially around my nose if my allergies get bad or if I've had a cold and had to blow my nose so much, it's sore!)- dry cuticles, cracked knuckles from washing my hands a lot as a nurse... and many more uses.<br />It's so multipurpose, convenient, and wonderful for anyone with sensitive skin as it doesn't have any perfumes or harsh additives. I HIGHLY recommend this product!\n",
      "5898->This face moisturizer STINKS! | 1 | 1 | Literally.  It stinks.  In addition, the consistency of it was also not pleasing.  I didn't find it to be very absorbent into my skin, very thick.  Returning this product and do NOT recommend.<br />I only tried this product as a replacement of the lavender brilliance facial moisturizer made by the same manufacturer; it's no longer available.  Guess I'm still in the market for a good replacement.\n",
      "5902->Lightweight, Easy to Use Facial Brush with 2 Speeds and Pulsing Action | 4 | 1 | I have used a Clarisonic Mia brush for more than two years, and although I like it, I've read that the Clarisonic brush can be too harsh.  So, I was interested to try the Philips PureRadiance brush.  First, the differences:<br /><br />1.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.<br />2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.<br />3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.<br />4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.<br /><br />The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It's not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you'll need to compare features.  If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.\n",
      "5908->Great files | 5 | 1 | This pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure. I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don’t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they’re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren’t sharp. I’m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.\n",
      "5911->Warning! Glass piece.! | 1 | 1 | Absolutely horrible.  When you cracks the top, the glass broke unevenly and leaves glass pieces with the ample.<br />It is not only safe to use the bottle and dangerous to use it on the face... I almost made a scratch on my face with this.. be careful. This is Nono product.\n",
      "5912->JUNK | 1 | 1 | JUNK! Wouldn’t cut if you TRIED to cut with it. CERTAINLY doesn’t remove hair. From anywhere.<br />Total rip off\n",
      "5924->Great bag.  But mesh pocket just out of reach... | 4 | 1 | This has served me very well on several trips now.  Holds tons of stuff.<br /><br />The only negative is that my bag arrived with the top mesh zipper compartment broken.  There is no zipper pull.  So, it does not open. It just sits there,  taunting me with promises of what it could hold if only it would open...\n",
      "5926->Never Received The Powder | 2 | 1 | The stamp takes a bit of practice to get into the right spot. And it is pretty bulky so it’s kinda hard to see what you’re doing.<br /><br />But the reason I am giving this product two stars is because I paid for the advertised product (the stamp and powder set) and only received the stamp and never the powder. I have tried to find a way to get in contact with the company but have had no luck.\n",
      "5934->Cute | 4 | 1 | These are cute. They are a little wider than some of my other bands like this. I just need to get used to that.<br />Nice though. I am looking forward to wearing them this fall.\n",
      "5945->Decent, Smells Like Play-doh | 3 | 1 | I have mixed hair. As I'm aging, I'm getting some super wiry, kinked hairs! I picked this up because someone recommended it to me.<br /><br />I also have thick hair, so I have to use more than what the instructions say, but the whole bottle still has lasted over a month. It's not as effective as my usual leave-in (Garnier Fructis).<br /><br />This conditioner has a VERY strong, perfume-y odor. What you're going to mainly smell is the vanilla, with wheat-y undertones. Guess what Play-doh's scent is based off of? :) No, seriously--look it up! It doesn't bother me too much, though anyone sensitive to smells or who doesn't like vanilla will be put off.\n",
      "5949->So far, way better than other heated eyelash curlers I've tried!! | 5 | 1 | Not sure it will keep working but I'm loving this eyelash curler!! I have lashify diy eyelash extensions, and this curler is so much better than the lashify heated eyelash curler: Gets equally as hot and has the clip to hold your lashes. I sleep on my face and my eyelashes get pressed up straight up when I'm sleeping. When I wake up they look a hot-mess. The Lashify curler did not help me with this problem due to what I needed to do to fix my problem (no clip to hold lashes). I can first pull the lashes down at the base to have the correct angel again after waking up, and then once they are at the right angle coming off my eyes, I can curl the tops out of the straight mess they become when sleeping.<br />The whole device is made out of hard plastic including the tip. Holds my lashes well. $10 less than lashify curler too. Wish I had never purchased the lashify one now.<br />This product had good reviews until recently. It's been in my wishlist until this past week and when I purchased, I did not realize the reviews had gotten so bad. Not sure what is up with this.<br />It is true that you have to curl your lashes in segments with this curler, and can't to the full lash with one curl, so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the right choice for you.\n",
      "5950->Not universal | 3 | 1 | I have a pretty basic blow dryer. It's a standard size. I cannot for the life of me get this on my dryer. Also I know a lot of people buy this specifically for the Dyson and the Black Orchid diffuser. I ended up returning my Dyson but still wanted to use this on the Black Orchid and my regular dryer. The diffuser doesn't have enough surface space for this to really get a good grip and stay on. And it's a pain in the butt to put it on over and over. I don't know how y'all are doing it.<br /><br />I'm keeping it because I don't have a printer to print a return label, but I would really like to return it since I'm not able to use it.\n",
      "5966->Googled and looked that up and saw the video on how this makes your hair grow fast and saw the amazing results and thought well | 2 | 1 | My wife really want to buy ovation cell therapy for her hair.<br />So I Google to see what it was and did the whole YouTube on it to see. Someone mentioned the leclaire products .Googled and looked that up and saw the video on how this makes your hair grow fast and saw the amazing results and thought well ok let's give this a try looks like a new product that could kick but so decided to follow the crowd and bit this for her gift got all three thing. The product are very small for the cost nut let's see.....if this post doesn't get delete like My first one I submitted did I will update ..I'm trying to be honest and I'll wait to see how my wife like its. Happy  holidays\n",
      "5969->It's a good cushion | 4 | 1 | I like the product. I honestly think the packaging of this is one of my favorite. The silver top makes it seem really luxurious.<br />Aside from packaging, the coverage of this is really controllable but I'd say its about medium coverage. I have really really bad hyperpigmentation on both of my cheeks from cystic acne, but this did a decent job of lessening the pigmentation. However, you could still see a bit of my hyperpigmentation.<br />Consistency is the main reason that i gave this four stars. It's not extremely dewy especially compared to the typical korean bb cream. But it is a bit sticky on the skin, so I would recommend setting it with a powder. I have EXTREMELY oily skins, so I did need to reapply this throughout the day. But that didnt matter too much because this is really easy to carry around with me.<br />I've tried the missha magic cushion, ohui cover cushion, iope cover cushion and this one. I personally like this one the best.\n",
      "5974->Input volt 100-130 | 4 | 1 | I use oral-B for a long time.  This type is good.<br /><br />But the input voltage is 100-130, not suitable for travelling around the world.\n",
      "5986->They are pretty but chip off in 24 hours or less | 2 | 1 | I was so excited about these nails. They are the perfect length so I don’t have to file very much at all. I love French tips as I just put on a gel base coat then my powder (usually holographic chrome or a translucent mermaid color) or gel clear with sparkles and then my gel top coat.<br />Unfortunately they don’t last long. One of the nails popped off within a few hours of work putting them on. I thought maybe I just didn’t glue it on well enough. Then on the second day (not even 24 hours later) I had one of the white tips crack and fall off. Then as I was making my bed I notice that another one had cracked and it fell off  I was just pulling the sheet up. Then about 30 minutes later another tip came off. 4 in total in 24 hours.<br />I’m sorry to say but I cannot recommend these. They are pretty and just the right size but unfortunately don’t last more than 24 hours.<br />Possibly a bad batch????  I don't know.\n",
      "5988->Packaging not user friendly and Made in China | 2 | 1 | I like the size, thickness and texture of the wipes.  However, they don't seem to be well packaged - it's hard to pull out one at a time, and it is virtually impossible to push the additional 1-3 wipes that come out back in, at least while the package is still pretty full.<br />I also don't like that these are Made in China, simply because I don't think we have any control over the ingredients. (Even cheap store brand baby wipes I bought were made in the U.S.)<br />Lastly, I tried to go to the website mentioned on the packaging and it is non-existent.\n",
      "5995->To high on nose, | 4 | 1 | Still fogs up, to high on my nose interferes with eye glasses. Was supposed to get 2 face mask only received only one<br />Ty Kat\n",
      "6017->Totally painless, needs a battery, but works as it should | 4 | 1 | As much as I hate to admit it, getting close to 50 brings lots of unpleasant changes and some great ones. One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br /><br />This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.\n",
      "6019->It's ok | 4 | 1 | I was buying a product from out of the country, That is was an RX, it seems to be no longer allowed on Amazon.<br />After reading every review, I chose this one.<br />it's much better then Bio-freeze, and have used it many times. No weird smell or staining. It works, but I'm not fully there for this prroduct.<br />suggestion: I put on my Neck area when stiff, and found that it had a burning sensation.\n",
      "6030->Works Ok | 3 | 1 | I cant quite put my finger on it but the scent of this product was odd. When I applied it my feet felt softer but by the next morning all hydration was gone. It works just as good as other foot moisturizing products on the market that you have to apply daily.<br /><br />The cream is really thick so I'd suggest wearing a pair of socks after applying it.\n",
      "6031->Not great | 2 | 1 | Pros: The hair color is cute and they are soft<br />Cons: They smell horrible like a perm and they shed a lot compared to the higher end extensions such as BELLAMI and ZALA etc. I wanted to give these a try based on reviews so I bought 3 packs but they’re too thin imo. If you have thin hair or long hair already, these may work for you. But I have medium thick blunt cut, short hair. I returned.\n",
      "6033->Not magnetic. Going in trash. | 1 | 1 | When I opened the package to see the lashes, all of the lashes were in one big bunch, none were organized, it was a mess. Took me awhile to match them up. So my first fear was that they weren’t magnetic enough.<br />I was right. Yesterday was day one of wearing them, they didn’t last. The glue comes off your lid and the lashes are definitely not magnetic enough. One almost peeled all the way off. It was embarrassing. You should be able to do the pull-test after they are on right.... but don’t do it with these ones. I’ve purchased 10-sets from Amazon before that are strong and the glue and lashes last all day. These ones are being tossed in the trash.<br /><br />UPDATE: I didn’t toss them. But instead tried them with my other eyelash liner/ glue. The base of these lashes are still cheaper and more Stiff, but they worked much much better with my other liner. I’ll use them.\n",
      "6040->Good buy. Know what you are trying to treat/address | 4 | 1 | Girlfriend tried it and it helped. She has the deep-seated, hormonal acne. Not the classic superficial inflammatory acne. It helped clear up the superficial lesions but didn't do much for the deeper ones (as I would have expected).<br />Seems better than most acne/skin cleanser products.\n",
      "6046->Great argan oil | 5 | 1 | It's a big bottle, 4 oz is a lot of argan oil considering how little you need of it.<br /><br />I use it for<br />cuticles<br />deep conditioning<br />a hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)<br />mixing with essential oils I use argan as the carrier oil<br />massage oil<br /><br />For those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp. You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don't really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.<br /><br />I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review. I am more than happy with this argan oil, as i have tried others and some I was definitely not happy with.\n",
      "6047->Fantastic for a blended tight/loose curl look | 4 | 1 | Definitely works.  Will curl my hair like no other tool I've tried.  Long as in REALLY long wand which is awesome for us long haired women.  BUT the advertising that you can have either tighter or looser curls by using selective sections of the wand - not so much.  Unless you have some serious time to spend carefully wrapping then moving each little piece back to the larger knobs your hair ends up in the valleys, giving a tighter curl, which I don't always want.<br /><br />So for a breeze through my hair to get fabulous curls yes it's awesome.  Will have to purchase a larger sized wand to get the looser curls looks I sometimes want.\n",
      "6056->not very good quality | 1 | 1 | I bought one of these from Sephora once and thought to myself I can't believe I'm overpaying for this but then I lost my Sephora one and bought this amazon one and the Sephora price was definitely worth it bc it way way better quality.<br /><br />the bristles are way too stiff and doesn't feel good to brush your hair with.<br /><br />you can tell this is a pretty cheaply made product.\n",
      "6058->Liked in the beginning.... | 3 | 1 | I liked it in the beginning, since it was nice styled, soft and good mustache, great appearance but after 2 days working ...hair and beard re becoming a full of mess like all the rest much cheaper wigs and beards..<br />Synthetic hair is bad if you are planing to use it a lot\n",
      "6059->No mess, no fuss but patience needed! | 4 | 1 | I was dire hard fan of Nair Roll On Wax Hair Remover until they stopped making it but where Nair failed with their roll on wax was the mess......dripping bottle with no way to stand the bottle of wax upright unless propped against something. In comes Belle!<br /><br />Let me just say for the record, I bought the purple one with the base because apparently they have the pink one shown that doesn't come with the base. (I'm gonna order that one but I'll get to that in just a minute). This system is wonderful.....no mess, nice and clean and you can keep it on the base so that means it's upright and no worries about dripping wax. Once you've used it, I'd suggest wiping the wax head off just to get the wax residue off from your usage.<br /><br />The base comes with an additional plug outlet on the side which is why I'm ordering the pink one for 14.99. It appears you can heat two cartridges at the same time and I'm ecstatic about that.<br /><br />The wax it came with went on smooth and to my surprise only needed one more application to remove my underarm hair. Put a little baby powder under your arm prior to waxing as this will create a smoother process and absorb any oil and moisture. With the Nair Roll On Wax, I sometimes had to do three to four applications to get all the hair and ya know that's not good for your skin when you're waxing.<br /><br />Now for the one star deduction.....I went back and forth with whether I should give 5 stars or 4 stars but I think 4 stars is still pretty darn good. The reason for this is the time it takes to heat the wax up. It took mine 25 minutes. That can seem like a long time when you're used to putting wax in the microwave and it's ready under 2 minutes. It's only a minor issue however the system definitely makes up for this plus you can order more cartridges in different scents.<br /><br />Overall, great buy and you won't regret it. If you were a Nair Roll On Hair Remover fan like I was, you can kiss the days of paying for overpriced Nair rollers on Amazon goodbye, since they've discontinued it and third party sellers are trying to make an insane profit.<br /><br />Edit to add......so apparently the pink one cannot be attached to the extra outlet. That outlet is for a different voltage but what the heck, I ordered it anyway. Can't go wrong with more than one hair removal system. I'll do a separate review on that one once I get it.\n",
      "6060->beware actual ingredients | 3 | 1 | the outer box lists one set of ingredients but each of 6 individual boxes inside has a different set of ingredients. while most of the outer box ingredients match the inner vials, the vials contain additional ingredients that you may not want. also, some of the ingredients are in a different order (suggesting differing amounts from most to least).<br /><br />watermelon frost is my go to for canker sores and sore throat. the powder provides some topical relief and does seem to speed up healthy because those irritated surfaces are no longer screaming in pain.<br /><br />because the differences in ingredients between the outer and inner boxes, I’m going to say I do not recommend this product at all. i’m glad there were inner boxes of the vials that were labeled with their respective ingredients. imagine if the ingredients were different and the inner boxes weren’t there to inform!\n",

It takes a while to heat up and doesn’t go as hot as I wish it did. It does straighten after many brush throughs and it adds a little volume.<br /><br />I think I will end up giving it to my teenage daughter whose hair is shorter & tamer than mine.\n",

My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having. But considering the expense of upgrades and support on other platforms, this felt like the safest bet and I hope it stays that way!\n",
      "6076->Hair damagers for sale.. | 1 | 1 | One of the jagged  white ends got caught in my hair and I gave up. Taking it out of my hair was more than half a nightmare. I returned these.<br /><br />These are a mm wider in diameter than advertised, FYI. See pics. One pic shows a blurry, jagged white end piece (sorry it's the best pic I could get!). One pic show the item side by side with the once popular grey loop rods (with a known diameter of 8mm). This item is visually larger in diameter.<br /><br />I only used one long enough to get it stuck and unstuck. I don't know how they will work exposed to perm chemicals.<br /><br />It feels like I could sleep in them if I wouldn't have to shave my head the next day.<br /><br />The end piece is not detachable. The hair tangles around the end piece.<br /><br />One more thing, this is my second attempt at ordering. I got a larger size on accident the first time, although it came in the mail quickly. I returned those and now I got these 4 days later.  I ordered the blue-colored rods to be delivered to me. I was told that the color is random, the size is what matters. I measured the new rod diameter and it's approx. 9mm diameter.<br /><br />Instead of these, I ordered small, yellow, straight, plastic rods. They are smaller and easier to handle than this product and also the grey loop rods. It's hard to find a small diameter in a rod.\n",
      "6097->Good hair for Price | 3 | 1 | I recently purchased this hair for my teenager. As of yet the hair is good quality does shed some, not overwhelming. The hair has a beauty supply packaged hair smell, again not overwhelming. Will update review in 2 weeks.<br /><br />Update: The hair is a decent buy for the price but it has terrible shedding I will be spending a bit more on her next set on hair bundles.\n",
      "6127->Very pleased! | 5 | 1 | Great value for the money!<br /><br />These are soft, pliable and do not seem to stick to my clients faces like other products that I have used.<br /><br />I will be purchasing these again!\n",
      "6140->For your Best Friend...arf arf! | 5 | 1 | I've had a couple of versions of this style of detangling brush.<br />Do they work? YES!<br />Do they last? NO!<br /><br />Except for this one. It has outperformed the others.<br />First, a bit about these brushes. They come in a number of shapes and paddles, but are similar in that they have the same kind of plastic bristles.<br />The bristles stagger in length, and painlessly smooth knots and tangles.<br />Most of the time the bristles start to bend and then the brush is useless. After months of hard use, this one is still good as new.<br /><br />These are a favorite with parents of kids with unruly hair, because they don't hurt.<br />I like it for myself, and it's also my 'secret weapon'.<br /><br />I have 2 Maltese dogs, one is in full coat. That means long, flowing hair to the ground. Most people with a Malt in full coat need to section off the coat and roll up the hair, otherwise it gets so tangled it needs to be cut.<br />This hairbrush is a silky coated dog's best friend. Maltese, Yorkies, Afghans, Havanese...they need this brush!\n",
      "6141->Great heat protection, somewhat difficult to clean | 4 | 1 | I ordered this silicone pad to place on my vanity so that I could rest my curling/straightening irons on it while getting ready without having to worry about scorching the wood vanity top. Overall, it works well and it just small enough to squeeze between the two drawers that come up on either side of my vanity. I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.\n",
      "6145->Holds good but are small | 3 | 1 | Does the job<br />I have really long hair and thick, holds but wish they was about an inch longer because I like to just put it up, not fuss with trying to get my hair to fit\n",
      "6154->Poor construction | 1 | 1 | This was Purchased through Amazon to replace a broken 2 month old unit from Costco... I found a better price through Amazon and it was a double pack which seemed like a great value. Unfortunately, this first unit only lasted one month and as a result I’m forced to send it back.<br />Very poor build quality!\n",
      "6158->Although I did not have that level of a grotesque experience(that's a good thing, though | 5 | 1 | I was inspired to buy one of these after watching some disgustingly fabulous videos of a doctor extracting extreme cases of blackheads.<br /><br />Although I did not have that level of a grotesque experience(that's a good thing, though!), these did exactly what I expected them to.  I cannot even see the pores on the sides of my nose, but rest assured gunk was extracted.<br /><br />I know, I know - You're not supposed to pick.  But if you're going to pick, do it in a clean and sterile fashion.\n",
      "6182->Very Nice, but missing a piece | 3 | 1 | The light box is very nice. I love how slim it is and how bright it gets! However the product description claimed that it comes with a power adapter and it did not.<br /><br />“it supplies with a USB cable and can be plugged into any device with USB port, like computer, power bank or the supplied 100/240V-50HZ power adapter that connects directly into a wall socket.”\n",
      "6189->Super Fast Shipping, love the product. | 5 | 1 | I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this shipped. I literally got it in two days when the delivery date said at least a week to ten days. Initially, I was a bit concerned because I only received the shampoo, however, the free gift arrived a day later. Everything was shipped safely and no damages to the product.<br /><br />Product Review: excellent product. It's definitely a yummy scented deep conditioning product. I like it because it doesn't irritate my scalp or dry out my hair. I use the Shea butter and oil as well.<br /><br />Satisfied customer :)\n",
      "6196->Thin wimpy face clothes | 2 | 1 | No go on these.  Basically a damp piece of toilet paper.  Very thin and flimsy with no texture to clean pores.<br /><br />Smell is good but that is about it.\n",
      "6221->A lovely gift set | 5 | 1 | This would make a lovely gift set for all those people you don't know 'that ' well. But since the 3 enclosed bath bombs spell MOM, then the box is limited... The gift box wrapping is lovely. Take off the mocha silk ribbon which matches well with the paper, and underneath is a plain cardboard box.<br />I love these combo boxes: inside: 3 bath bombs which are very lightly scented, a box of dried rose petals (yeah potpourri bags) and an adorable, square bar of soap. I put the soap in my shower near the shower head as the water drips release some of the scent over time as the soap melts.<br />Anyway, a very nice, gentle set. I wish the bombs didn't spell MOM as then this would be very giftable to something other than MOM.\n",
      "6231->Reviews are Right - It Doesn't Brush :/ | 1 | 1 | I saw the reviews that said it doesn't do anything, but I was hoping it was more subjective and maybe it might work for me. Nope, it really doesn't brush anything.<br /><br />- Bristles are weak, arrived bent<br />-Maaaaybe could work if you have super thin hair<br />- Thin and flimsy feeling if that's a concern<br /><br />I use \"wet\" hairbrushes that are designed like this, and I have to say that the quality really varies. I have a couple that I love and work wonderfully--brushes tangled wet hair painlessly, evenly brushes hair to tie it up. I've only tried 4 brands, but this is the worst I've seen. The bristles are weak--they're really thin, even for wet brushes, and they arrived bent (not because it was used--it was in the plastic wrap and everything). I do have thick hair, but this is the first brush I've used (of ANY kind--tiny travel ones included) that feels like it's literally going on top of my hair and not through it at all, even when I try to press down. It maaay work if you have thin hair, but I mean really thin hair, and even them I'm doubtful.<br /><br />I bought this hoping I could use it as a travel brush, so I wasn't too picky as long as it brushed relatively okay. Obviously not, but the plastic is also lighter and thinner than I expected it to be, again, even for a small travel brush, so I'm doubtful it or the hinge wouldn't break easily with pressure while trying to brush thick or tangly hair.\n",
      "6245->Solo para abundante cabellos, largosss y gruesos | 3 | 1 | Funciona bien, pero solo en cabellos muy largos y abundantes, tienes que tener bastante cabellos y gruesos, es<br />incómodo de trabajar\n",
      "6252->Nightmare to get activated! | 3 | 1 | If you install before your old payroll runs out, too bad so sad, you lose whatever part of the year you still had.  And you cannot activate without a current FULL credit card number.  I didn't have the card handy that was on the current license and it hadn't expired so I didn't expect them to refuse to activate until I had a full number.  So, I had to get a new CC just so I could activate the software.<br />Even though they were still billing the old card monthly for the extra employees.  Once you give them your cc number they automatically bill you for the full Quickbooks AND the payroll next year unless you call and cancel the purchase.  And then to use the retail license from Amazon when you buy it you have to call again.  and if you decide to wait on the payroll part if it expires later, you have to call AGAIN.  It is maddening to do this every year.  You save some money but you spend time.  So, if you are busy and billing time, you won't find this saves you anything and the frustration is high.  Quickbooks really needs to look into automating their registration process.\n",
      "6256->Does It’s Job Well | 5 | 1 | Nice creamy feel, goes on smoothly. Covers lightly not like foundation. It just improves the texture and evens out my skin tone.<br />I will buy this again.\n",
      "6258->This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam | 5 | 1 | I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.\n",
      "6263->Great Brushes, Just Need A Way To Tell Them Apart | 4 | 1 | I’ve been going tying to make some more environmentally friendly swaps lately and these bamboo brushes are one of the ways. I do really like these. The bristles don’t shed like some do the other brands that I have tried. They hold up well and then when done, the bristles can be removed and the handle composted, leaving behind little in the end compared to the mountain of plastic handles in a lifetime.<br /><br />But we have five people on my house. I’d love a way to identify whose brush is whose. I’ve seen some companies put numbers, others do colored bristles (which obviously won’t work so well with charcoal), and maybe there are other options as well. Once that happens, these will be perfect.\n",
      "6264->Why did they put aluminum in this product? Aluminum ... | 2 | 1 | Why did they put aluminum in this product?  Aluminum has been shown to speed up alzheimer's and dementia.<br />I can not buy it for that reason.\n",
      "6287->Nope... | 1 | 1 | They look like two big caterpillars sitting  on top of my face. Not  authentic, not human Hair.<br /><br />As a person with no eye brows due alopecia I was hoping to find a pair of brows that I don’t have to draw on. . Theses aren’t it. The lace is think and noticeable. Brows look like something out of a bad stage play.\n",
      "6293->Flakey. | 1 | 1 | The first package had a broken green and broken blue in it. The replacement arrived in good condition.<br /> The colours are decently bright if you have the patience to do a few layers. Very liquidy... Drippy even. Once dry it is mostly waterproof. Sadly, once dry, it tends to flake off (even a single layer).<br /> Another nit-picky thing is this stuff has a smell like craft paint.\n",
      "6308->Tried many, liked this one Best | 5 | 1 | I tried 3-4 different brands of salt spray including Byrd and this one really stood out.<br />Others made my hair crunch/ too stiff or shiny or matte but Herbivores really got it to look exactly how I wanted it to without looking like I had a lot of product in my hair.<br />More expensive than the others. You get what you pay for\n",
      "6310->Great for those with athletes foot! | 4 | 1 | Using this product and Defense Shower Gel (link here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BICMJ16/ref=twister_B01E0GSW8Q?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 ) I have been able to completely get rid of Athletes Foot (after having Athletes foot for 6 years). The defense soap is the cure, this thing just makes it easy to use it every day. I mix one bottle of defense gel up with water in a spray bottle which I spray onto my feet and then scrub with this thing.<br />The main complaint I have with this item is that the top part hits me on the top of my foot even when trying to be careful not to, and it hurts pretty bad when it does. If the top part (the arch holding the bristles above the foot) was at an angle, the edge wouldn't hit your foot and it would make the whole thing allot easier/comfortable to use. The only other (minor) change that I would like is for it to have more bristles in the back instead of the stone and the bristles in general could be a bit firmer as they are very soft.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice inexpensive product that works great for me.\n",
      "6316->Actually Works When Used Properly- Ask for a link to my video review | 5 | 1 | Things I learned:<br />-DO NOT over massage<br />-Use the cream properly<br />-Use the massager properly<br />-use the cream right after. These products come in a pair for a reason.<br /><br />Alright, I'll get to the point. Does the product do what it says?<br />In so many words, yes, most definitely.<br />My experience with the products was as follows.<br />First, I mistakenly used the cream on my legs during my shower as a way of lubricating the massager.<br /><br />TIP: This is incorrect... I know that now.<br /><br />Luckily, I din't waste much and my experience with the brush was actually really great. Massaging is painless and since its manual, you get to choose the level of pressure you feel you ought to apply.<br />One caveat--do not over rub. I did so and ended up bursting my bum, waking up the following morning with bits of--what I assume was--busted blood cells. I even bruised a bit. Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice. I've used it about 5 times now, and I can already so a minor difference. Although I generally attribute this to the massager, the cream does leave the skin feeling tighter for sure. It does remain sticky for a couple of seconds (about 45...less than a minute, not bad) but drys completely.<br /><br />My experience has taught me that, by using the correct products correctly, you can actually get rid of cellulite.<br /><br />Last and final point; I'm not sure how permanent this is, however, massaging and creaming really isn't that much of a hassle. Any hey, if it keeps the cellulite off...<br /><br />Disclaimer: Free for review.\n",
      "6318->Not real rose quartz | 2 | 1 | Received a really nice looking roller and it seems to feel pretty good on the face, however, after a couple of uses I realized this roller is definitely not 100% rose quartz. It warms up very quickly which is not supposed to happen with real rose quartz because that is a naturally cold stone.<br /> The headband that came with the roller is quite useful though.\n",

      "6326->Even better than Luminous -YES! | 5 | 1 | Large bottle.  Great color match. Secure bottle. I'm 100% happy!<br />After reading the reviews I was excited to try this. WoW!  I purchased the Luminous kit previously & at first was excited but the bottles were small and they always leaked (in shipping & in my cabinet). This color was a perfect match for my light (not pale) skin. I use with my Luminous air system and LOVE it! This will be my go to!\n",
      "6354->Saving the planet one product at a time! 🌍🌏🌎 | 5 | 1 | Saving the planet just got easier. If you're like me you are used to using a q-tip and then throwing it away. By making a  simple change in your life you can cut the use of single use items. I was pretty nervous to change up my routine due to not knowing how sanitary these could be. But actually using this product changed my mind quickly. Keeping one for ear use and one for make up removal. You can use water or alcohol to clean these.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*reusable<br />*easy to clean<br />*multiple sided that have multiple functions.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Only thing this does not have is a case. If it has a carrying case it would be more convenient.\n",
      "6355->Brush is far too soft for me, but I only bought it for the handle. | 3 | 1 | I needed a long handle for a back brush with much stiffer bristles that would really SCRIB my back.<br /><br />This brush feels more like a soft hand sliding smoothly down your back rather than scrubbing it.<br /><br />So I threw the brush away and jammed the handle into an Eppco HU1310101 Heavy Duty Two Sided Hand & Nail Brush and I'm happy.  It has a smaller surface but the bristles actually scrub your skin.<br /><br />More expensive than I'd like, but it works for me.\n",
      "6366->Worst hair tie on the market. | 1 | 1 | These are the worst! The material is way too thin and weak. I tried these because Scuni ruined their awesome hair bands by adding their logo to them and creating a weak point. But these are still worse.<br /><br />They majorly stretch out after just one use, and then randomly snap on the second or third use. You'll just be sitting there and feel this weird, crawly sensation on the back of your head, and then your hair starts coming down and you find a pathetic, snapped piece of plastic hanging in your hair somewhere.<br /><br />Unless you don't plan on actually holding any hair up with these bands, save your money.\n",
      "6367->Wish I received longer exp date.... | 3 | 1 | It did actually make my pimple a bit smaller next day but what I didn't like was exp date.<br />All Korean skin care have 2.5 years expiration date from manufacture date. It is Korean law to print exp date or manufacture date on skin care products and makeup products.(Makeup products have 3 years instead of 2.5 years.)<br />Product I receive is April 2021 exp date, that is only 10 month away and that means this was manufactured on Dec 2018, that sound pretty old as it is June 2020 right now....<br />Yes it is not expired but I have been using many korean skin care brands and almost always I get the products that have at least 2 years or longer exp date.<br />This is not something you use every day like toner and I only have 10 month to use and there's no way that I can use whole bottle by April.<br />I think it's good product but hopefully you'd get longer exp date product than mine so you wouldn't waste your money!\n",
      "6369->Good Brush | 4 | 1 | My sister has this brush & I love to  borrow it. It's a very good brush. I think I'll get my own.<br />Now, I'm taking one star due to the short handle on the brush. The other Vizeri Beauty products pictured still get 5 stars. I love their products and will cont to order them thru Amazon.com.\n",
      "6373->Its the bounce for Me without bouncing😁 | 4 | 1 | I purchased these bundles about October 2020 and constructed a wig out of them. I like fullness so i purchased one 22\" two 20\" two 18\" and two 16\" and a frontal from another vendor 14\".<br />I did not use all my bundles either, approximately 3.5. THIS HAIR IS SOOOOO SOFT, LIKE NO JOKE. I could run my fingers through it at any given time even with product on the hair. Bundles did show evident short spots and split ins but nothing to complain about in my opinion. It holds a curl very well, but have not wore it bone straight.<br />No smell originally out the package. I did cut my bundles so i expected shedding but nothing out of the norm. It is very much worth the price and IM CERTAIN I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN. I would recommend this vendor for hair purchase based off my experience.\n",
      "6376->Incorrect description | 1 | 1 | The description says the scent is a blend of  \"citrus, oakmoss, Tonka\".<br />However the actual bottle is \"warm spice, Tonka, sandalwood\"  which is not the scent I want or was looking for.<br />Now I'm stuck with this since the seller won't take returns.\n",
      "6379->They work, but wish there was some way to label them | 4 | 1 | These are nice little silicon bottles. They meet the TSA requirements. We had no issues travelling with them through security. No leaks. They have a rubber topper on the hole to prevent leaks, which is nice. (I have other silicone bottles with that same feature but with those you have to apply so much pressure to get the shampoo or soap out of the bottle that you end up squirting out way more than you want. These bottle are much easier to control and squirt out the exact amount you want. They are also flexible, so you can kind of \"squish\" them into place as needed.<br /><br />My only quibble is that there is no way to mark what is in each container, so we forgot whose shampoos and conditioners were in each bottle. I mean, we figured it out (based on smell), but it could have been easier.\n",
      "6388->I love them. | 5 | 1 | You will go through a lot of soap but this brand is the one to buy.<br />I discovered the first one about 40 years ago when a hotel guest put it into the washing machine.  DON'T DO THAT!  It ended up wound around the base of the inner tub and one end stopped the pump.<br />This one rinses out clean in seconds so it never needs to leave the shower until it is worn out.  I usually get about 2000 showers or 5 years out of one. Where I live these are for sale in most stores that stock bath tools, but the convenience of  Amazon makes that trip unnecessary.\n",
      "6391->Manages to burn my skin before removing my hair | 3 | 1 | It's amazing really. The directions say to leave it on no longer than 7 minutes if you have tough hair. 7 minutes is long enough to remove peach fuzz; but that's not why I'm here, is it? It also doesn't seem to slow down growth, at all. Perhaps even, growth has somehow sped up.<br /><br />I'll keep trying, though. I certainly spent money on this.\n",
      "6394->Four Stars | 2 | 1 | Great but too much fall out. Cool for the price.<br />On a second thought. It's useless. Not pigmented needs a lot of work.\n",
      "6400->smooth, soothing, but unclear how long bearings will last | 5 | 1 | UPDATE: I still don't know how long this will last, but 2 months in I love this roller (store it in my freezer and use it every day), so I'm upgrading to 5 stars from 4.<br /><br />This jade roller manages to feel cool almost any time of day, which is great for reducing puffiness. It looks precisely as pictured, and comes with a storage bag and sweet uplifting note (unexpected and appreciated, even though I know everyone gets one).  **If** it were a paint roller (and it's not), I wouldn't be entirely happy with how smoothly it rolls--it's decent but feels like the bearings could be a bit more reliable--but I'm not planning to subject it to heavy-duty work and even if it wobbles the tiniest bit when it rolls (over time) it's not going to harm anything. So it could be improved slightly, but overall I'm happy with the product.\n",
      "6403->Too dark, slightly dry | 3 | 1 | The color is a dark gray, almost charcoal. A similar shaped eyebrow pencil from Elite (Korean) is a light grey so I can adjust the saturation by apply layers. This pencil is too dark for my taste.<br /><br />The texture is slightly dry so it is hard for me to get it applied evenly. Maybe I will do better with more practice.<br /><br />The beveled edge is great for applying color to the thicker and thinner parts of the eyebrow. I can make it look very natural which is what I want. Probably the best aspect of this pencil is its low price.\n",
      "6409->Sorry, this did not work out for my kids | 1 | 1 | I bought these for my teenager kids. Bought 2 different scents. Both tubes absolutely smell like blue cheese or some even more potent cheese. Something is just not right.<br /><br />No way I am allowing the smell of LUME on anyone who lives under the same roof as me. My kids will revert back to the brands they have tried before.\n",
      "6413->Be prepared to let it dry | 4 | 1 | I think for what you pay, it’s worth the money, especially if I’d bought the larger pack, better value.  And I actually like how it goes on.  It just takes a long time to dry. And I won’t use the top coat again.  It made drying time triple and was messy.<br />Over all I like these enough to use them but just for the sake of seeing how other water based polished work, I’ll probably order a different brand next time.\n",
      "6439->Good for the most part. | 4 | 1 | I think it's alittle hard to use but my daughter loves it. I bought it for her but I tried using it once, it was alittle difficult for me to get my hair to stay wrapped around it.<br />All and all it's a good product my daughter uses it all the time.\n",
      "6454->This cream is already written so many good reviews, so I will be brief | 5 | 1 | This cream is already written so many good reviews, so I will be brief. Very easy to use, I like this small press on the cover!<br />And the most important result, after a month of use:<br />It moisturizes the skin.<br />Quickly absorbed.<br />The skin around the eyes become more radiant and slightly leveled off color.<br />nice texture<br />Almost odorless.\n",
      "6455->Will not buy again | 2 | 1 | Ok so these are very pretty . I have 4 packs in my head in these photos  they are very versatile and dye well . They are thick and good quality tested human hair<br />HOWEVER! There is a major flaw in this system ,every time I brush my hair I loose 3-4 Strands which would not be an issue except the metal at the bead stay put it’s not an install issue it’s a manufacturer error ! The hair slides of the metal u tip and then they are broken and done for.. I will be looking for a new nano tip brand randomly loosing strands and having the remaining metal lost in my hair is super uncomfortable\n",
      "6456->Grey water shampoo | 1 | 1 | Shampoo is like water, very little sudsing. The conditioner is thick and difficult to rinse from my long white hair. Smell is ok, not pampering.<br />Back to jirmack and shimmerlights<br /><br />My son asked my why my hair looked purple in the back. This just gets worse as I go.\n",
      "6464->Not as good as I thought | 1 | 1 | I don’t like this soap.  It lathers nicely.  The lather dries out quickly after hitting face.  Had a hard time getting the shave half as close as the Proraso Green did.  It gave me a rash and made my skin itch.<br />I wanted to like it.\n",
      "6481->What? | 1 | 1 | I can't tell that this Mist does anything, except make my hair smell like tea tree mint toothpaste. And for $26 a bottle, it needs to be fabulous.<br /><br />This product is designed to change the alkalinity of your hair, so that it stays smooth and shiny. I accomplish that with light argon oil.  Truly, I couldn't tell that this product did anything. I see no merit to its use, and would look toward other finishing products to smooth hair and restore shine. They're also usually much cheaper than this Mist.\n",
      "6486->Not for all hair types but... | 3 | 1 | Im sure this product works great with other hair types but My hair is sort of on the African American side because Im mixed.<br />My hair is Very Long, Super Thick and wavy. Its also very dry and brittle. Even the best of the so called best hair care products have never worked for my hair. So now that you know a little more about my hair type you can better understand were I'm coming from.<br /><br />When I first lather up with this shampoo, with the lather in, yes it does feel super soft but as soon as I rinse it out it feels even dryer than before even while its still wet, but at the same time it makes my scalp feel the cleanest its ever felt and has seemed to cure my very itchy scalp.<br />Its like a negative and a positive at the same time for me. Which is why I'm rating it 3 stars because I am on the fence with this one.<br /><br />I was provided a sample of this product from the Manufacturer for my Honest and Unbiased Feedback. All opinions stated in this review<br />are my own.<br /><br />I tried another product just like this one with identical ingredients just a different brand and it did make my hair soft afterwards. Maybe the formula was off in my bottle? I had really high hopes for this shampoo as I have used their other natural products and loved them!<br /><br />I'll stick to my current regular for now\n",
      "6494->Two combs, one 5 stars, one 1 star | 3 | 1 | I bought two, one for home and one for work.<br /><br />The home one is great- best comb I have ever owned, by far.  Works great for the beard, and I end up using it on my hair as well.<br /><br />The one at work smells awful.  I let it sit for a while to air out, but that didn't help.  I washed it repeatedly, but that didn't help.  On one side, the surface isn't smooth - it looks like half of that side of the comb was gouged.  The good comb is smooth on both sides.  This one smells strongly like rotting fecal material.  It isn't getting any better.  I grew up with horses, and worked on a cattle ranch.  I can tune out a certain amount of odor, but this is repulsive.  I don't want it anywhere near my beard.<br /><br />If I could be sure that this is just a random bad comb, I would buy a new one to replace it, but at this point I have one good and one bad.  Those aren't good odds.<br /><br />Update - I let the smelly comb sit in the back of my closet for a couple months.  Every now and then I soaked Eucalyptus essential oil into the scratched up side of the comb.  It doesn't smell anymore.\n",
      "6500->I love this cleanser | 1 | 1 | I love this cleanser! It leaves my skin sooo fresh and smooth, but the best part, and the reason why I bought it, it removes all kinds of impurities from my face, works like magic!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I bought this product for the second time and I'm so disappointed! Idk if the formula changed, but this is not what I bought the first time. It leaves my face oily and NOT fresh at all, the bottle came over 2 inches empty (this is an expensive product) and it made me break out SO BADLY.\n",
      "6505->Great Cleanser!!! | 5 | 1 | This is a wonderful facial cleanser!  I have very sensitive skin, and I'm always nervous the first time I try out a new product, but I've had no reaction or irritation of any kind after using this morning and night over the last week.  I also haven't had any type of breakout which happens often with other products I've tried in the past.  That alone makes me very happy!<br /><br />I also like the consistency of the cleanser because a little goes a long way and making it much more cost efficient.  There are also these little conditioning 'beads' that kind of break apart to add jojoba oil to the cleanser.  I found that the lather amount is about right and the scent is very light to almost non-existent (in my opinion anyway).<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Department store quality at a reasonable price<br />*Small amount goes a long way making it cost efficient<br />*Little to no scent<br />*Conditioning jojoba beads<br />*Rinses off easily<br />*Non-drying<br />*Non-irritating to my sensitive skin<br />*Amount of cleanser for the price (6.7 oz)<br />*Money back guarantee<br /><br />Cons:<br />*None noted<br /><br />Even though I did receive a discounted price in order to use this cleanser and give a review based upon my experience with it, I was in no way influenced by the seller on the actual review.  Because I mostly shop online these days, the reviews I read help me to decision on which products to buy, I am determined to give the best information in my reviews for others to make their purchasing choices.  I feel very comfortable in recommending this cleanser if you are looking for a high quality cleanser with added benefits of conditioning/exfoliating using the best natural and scientific technology to also treat your skin.\n",
      "6519->Nice for starters | 4 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:a4c303c922bf2cd6817ff5005f70e858]] Ok. It comes with the forms that are very curved. Which are not my favorite. A brush and spatula, top and base coat, and the colors..: oh and a nail filer.<br />The consistency of the colors is very thick is hard to squeeze it out of the jar... which for me makes difficult to work with it so if you constantly wet your brush with alcohol it gets way way better! .<br />I love my nails and the set honestly has everything you need to start. ( The tubes are not full size)<br />About durability I still don’t know if my nails will let 3 days or 3 weeks .<br />To resume if you are just curious about poly gel and want a lot to start trying... this is a good one\n",
      "6521->Clear, healthy-looking skin after just 5 days! | 4 | 1 | The first time I tried this product I noticed how different this face wash is from my normal face wash; it left my skin feeling clean and fresh, without drying it out! After a week of using the product, I really do notice smaller pores, and clearer skin.<br /><br />I both love and hate the scent of this product. I love the fact that it has a eucalyptus-like effect that clears my sinuses. I don't like the 'organic' scent of the product that continues to linger long after I wash my face. It reminds me of mushrooms, and I hate mushrooms.<br /><br />The two cons are simple:<br /><br />Price- $34 for a 4.5oz bottle is extremely pricey! I'm not sure I can afford to keep buying this product.<br /><br />Time- The length of time recommended to scrub your face, and leave it on your face is a total of five minutes. There's not much else you can do while washing your face, so this either extends your shower time, or getting-ready time in the morning.<br /><br />The biggest pro is that I have clear, healthy-looking skin after only 5 days of using this product!\n",
      "6524->Great Size but a Runny Mess | 2 | 1 | I like the size and concept, but the lotion was very runny and not the best quality.  Once you open it, your either have to use it all of toss it as it will run out of the packaging as it is not thick at all.<br /><br />I hope this helps you, Cheers and Vidimo Se!\n",
      "6530->Tiny Bottles | 1 | 1 | These bottles are very small, they actually look bigger in the picture.<br />The 7.5ML of other gel nail polish I've are bigger than the 8ML.<br />I want to give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt, but the bottles came almost empty, they need to do better quality control. Colors are a bit off.<br />It definitely has a lot of different colors, I hope your set is in better condition than mine.<br />I appreciate Amazon's customer service, that's why I continue buying from them.<br /><br />Update 11/19/2021:<br />I tried this gel nail polish, it's so cheap, my nails started chipping on the 2nd day.\n",
      "6531->The tracks show! | 3 | 1 | *You're going to spend more time trying to cover up the weft/tracks that show.<br />There needs to be more hair on it especially at the top.<br />Also, the little sack/bag Your hair actually goes in doesn't stretch much ...I have a lot of hair and thick hair..it literally doesn't stretch all the way over my bun and I have been buying these ponytails since the 90s.<br />I hate that you can see the tracks. I.m going to end up  throwing it away.\n",
      "6537->Make your eyes feel delightful! | 4 | 1 | These are terrific! I really like these hemp and rose under eye mask patches. If you have puffy tired eyes that crave some tender loving care then these just may be what you need. They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.\n",
      "6547->Pretty Good for MTF facial Hair | 4 | 1 | My MTF spouse wanted this for the course hairs on their face and chest area and so far it has been working.<br />They have followed the advice others have given, such as:<br />1. keep your fingers salty/wet when using the device.<br />2. tug but don't force.<br />3. Use a low setting, and work your way up.<br /><br />They are currently at the higher settings as their pain tolerance is higher than most people, and they do it when I'm not home because it does do a loud popping noise when you are using the product right. It tends to get a bit annoying, so I'm grateful for that courtesy.<br /><br />It does take a lot of time though, as reported to me, so just be aware of that. It's not going to be a quick fix. You have to have a lot of patience with this, but as far as my spouse is concerned, they are happy with this purchase and it's working as intended for their course male hair.\n",
      "6550->A Review | 5 | 1 | I had been using the Norelco Cool Skin Advantaage for 4 years when it finally broke. So I got this.<br /><br />I have an extremely thick beard and have to shave daily. The 5 o'clock shadow happens around 11 AM.<br /><br />This razor did a great shaving job. It did the neck better than the Advantage. Most importantly, it does shave faster. I can honestly get a good shave within 3 - 5 minutes, the Advantage took 8 - 10, if not longer.<br /><br />Drawback - it feels flimsy. Especially after the Advantage, this razor feels light and cheap. But it still works great.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend it.\n",
      "6555->True ORIGINAL Avon Odessey perfume. | 5 | 1 | Three or so years ago Avon changed their original formula for Odessey perfume. When then changed its packaging they pulled a fast one and changed the scent, too. My husband noticed it before I did. To find the scent he loves, I had to search online through all the impostors claiming they had the real thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I purchased four bottles of the  true original and three of the fake. I failed the smell test because I was sniffing them one right after the other. In frustration I wrote a bad review of both sellers.<br /><br />I’m apologizing to this seller of the true original for giving her a rotten one star review. She didn’t deserve it.<br /><br />I put it on one day and my husband asked me where I had finally found the original scent, and I told him I didn’t, that this was a knock off. He told me I was crazy, that it was the same scent he loved me to wear and that I should smell like this all the time. I am truly sorry.<br /><br />So please believe me when I say that this IS the REAL TRUE Avon Odyssey perfume. It smells great and I get many, many compliments when I wear it, which is always.\n",
      "6562->Not very , but very loud. 3.75 Stars ✨ | 4 | 1 | I already had a large water flosser but was looking for something smaller and liked the idea of a rechargeable one. Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br />When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking. I really wanted to like it, but it's not for me. I hope that others have a better experience than I did. 3.75 Stars ✨\n",
      "6563->Not like the video | 2 | 1 | I ordered this set for my daughter, and I know the video was too good to be true. I was hoping it would help. While it’s easy to use and does make your skin feel nice, it doesn’t really work to help with black heads and acne. Also since it’s made in China all the instructions were in Chinese, so we had to google search it in English, for how long to use it etc…<br /> Luckily it really wasn’t expensive, live and learn.\n",
      "6569->Bad reaction , | 1 | 1 | Sorry to tell you,but I am starting with my wife:she add one drop in her eyes every night for about a week and one of her eye got infected and we have had no other option that to go see the doctor and gave her a prescription. And myself , I was using it for more than a week before bed and every morning and during the day I’ve had kind of itching in my eyes.<br />I am very disappointed and you have to be more caution when you put something in your eyes. I am using it at this time for my hair ....\n",
      "6572->Too long but cute | 4 | 1 | So I got this product in last week and I’m just putting it on today. I had my daughter to ease it out and fix the part. I tried it on and it’s just way too long. It’s very reminiscent of Cher in the 80s.  But not as fabulous. The hair is very irritating and there’s a lot of flyaways. There was also a patch of hair that was cut extremely short and it will not lie down. So what I did was I gave the wig a trim and I think it looks much better than the long week that I received. There’s a photo of how it looks now. And I’m really liking it a lot.<br /><br />Disclaimer<br />I used a coupon to get a percentage off of this purchase. I am not obligated to review anything but I like to review and hopefully help people! I have in no way been compensated for my opinion and I’m going to be honest and as detailed as I can.\n",
      "6574->Feels like fake hair after a week. | 2 | 1 | As soon as saw this hair out the pack, I was like this doesn't look human. But I went ahead and did the sew in. After a week, it is soooo stiff on the ends. I do hair so I know what I'm doing. There's alot of shedding. It's not a soft wave. The crimp/wave starts up at the track in some areas so that bump at the crown is terrible. This hair will not last all summer. It's kind of matted.<br /><br />The hair is wavy and not curly if you're expecting beachy vibes. If you have fine hair, or your hair is curly I wouldn't get this. It's a no for me.<br /><br />Update: the seller reached out saying they would do a 30% refund. Which is only 55.00. Then they said they would give me 1 free bundle (like what is that supposed to do). The old hair isn't reusable to mix with 1 new bundle. Then I was asked to change my review to 5 stars and they would compensate me. I replied, I'm only changing my review if they replaced all the hair because Im thinking I may have had a bad batch. But they didn't respond.. nor did they process the discount. Regardless this hair is a temporary style for a 1 week or 2 at the max and not a 130.00 either (less the discount). If synthetic hair is 60.00 then this hair is worth 100.00. And I got the 24-30 bundles. This hair is not viable after 2 weeks. My review stands!!\n",
      "6580->Happy so far | 4 | 1 | I have dry to normal hair, normal healthy scalp, and sensitive skin. I use this shampoo everyday and use conditioner ( not renpure) once or twice a week to keep my hair soft and tidy when brushed. I've been using this shampoo for 2 weeks now and so far, no rash or itchiness!<br /><br />I got this after getting sick of using a number of \"safe\" shampoos with no harsh chemicals that just does not foam as much, smell that good, and sometimes leave your hair oily. I  hoped for the Renpure shampoo to have more natural scent( not the \"natural\" fragrance but more like real essential oil kind of scent), but I was able to get used to it in the first week. I like how it does not have sulfates, phthalates, paraben, or formaldehyde. It does create luxurious foam and cleans my hair and scalp well.<br /><br />*it would be better if they secured the top better before shipping, because mine had to suffer quite a bit during delivery and leaked a bit.\n",
      "6581->Get O3 for the best look - Elegant Manicure | 5 | 1 | Why pay tons of money for a French manicure when it is so easy to do at home on your own schedule? I recommend the O3 color set as the pink color is very natural. You may want to use tip guides or you can just wing it. I didn't use tip guides and it came out great. Having a French manicure makes you look so elegant. I also found that the pink nail polish looks great on your toes. Enjoy!<br /><br />You may want to also purchase: [[ASIN:B00JCJ6R7K EVERMARKET(TM) 5 Bags 240PCS Nail Art Tool French Manicure Tip Guides]]- I'm going to try these next time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for a review.

      "6598->Leave in Conditioner for Curly Hair Therapy by Royal Locks | 5 | 1 | This is the real deal. Designed for naturally curly, wavy or grey hair,  or any hair type that needs deep conditioning.  I have 50 year old curly highlighted Irish hair. My styist actually noticed how soft it felt and controllable it looked.  The product calls it Curl Rescue with Keravis Ultra Conditioning Formula for Curls. No Sulfate or paraben; alcohol & cruelty free. With keratin and Vitamin B5.<br /><br />It is doubled packaged inside a mylar container to control any spill in transit.\n",
      "6605->Not Happy | 1 | 1 | The polish does not go on smooth and even.  It looks like I painted my fingernails with white out. It is not returnable. :(<br />Enough said.\n",
      "6609->T780 Trimmer | 5 | 1 | The vacuum works well but makes it hard for<br />close trimming of Mustache.<br />Product keeps the sink clean.\n",
      "6619->Great for miniature paints! | 4 | 1 | When I got back into miniature painting I did what many of us do: Buy paint, paint, and more paint! Soon my 3D-printed racks reached capacity and I wanted to get something that shows more than just the lid or bottom of the bottle so I looked at clear nail polish racks. I actually ordered a second set of them after I really liked the first one.<br />They fit the typical 15 - 20mL bottles nicely and can hold up to 14 if you do not use the end pieces. The end pieces are the reason I took off one star because they are hard to get in sometimes and can fall out more easily than I'd like. The second set was missing them completely (Seller took care of this though). Other than that I have no complaint at all. I can't remember if the supplied screws fit or not but I typically have to use my own mounting hardware anyway so that was of no consequence to me.\n",
      "6631->Disappointing Closeness | 2 | 1 | Having used regular razors all my life, this was my first experience to an electric razor.  I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />I gave the Norelco 8040X a solid week of use, thinking that it might get better over time (as their manual suggests).  It did not.<br /><br />Every morning after shaving I had to manually touch-up using a $2 Bic razor.  This product did not come anywhere near my skin no matter how light or hard I pressed it against me.  Maybe that's just how electric shavers are?  I'm not sure, but they can't be this bad.<br /><br />I was however impressed with the battery life (a full week on a single charge) and how quiet it is.  With the shower running, I could barely hear the motor.  It's waterproof, so I can use it in the shower.  It comes with a nice travel case.<br /><br />The sideburn attachment is a nice thought, but there was no ear/nose trimmer which I have seen in $20 Norelco sets.<br /><br />As for the moisturizing part, the lotion smelled nice but it didn't really add to the experience.  And from what I can see it's very expensive.<br /><br />It's back to my $2 razors for me.\n",
      "6632->Came busted but smells good | 3 | 1 | Pros<br />The scent is pretty good it lathers up pretty thick and for the cost it's not bad<br /><br />Cons<br />Came with a broken top and wo t pump at all<br />Bottle was cracked open so it was messy<br />Sticker over half the bottle\n",
      "6644->Wish it were bigger! | 2 | 1 | Way too small for my toenails, almost too small for my fingernails. Nice and sharp, though. And the built-in file is excellent.<br />I’m a sixty-five year old woman.\n",
      "6659->Not good... updated | 2 | 1 | I purchased these 6.5\" scissors to trim a wig. The shipping was fast, and the packaging was fine, but the scissors are just OK. I used them on the wig and realized the stainless steel does not perfectly align all the way from base to tip. There is enough of a tiny gap in the blade to cause crimping and re-cutting. The last half inch is aligned, and so is the blade at the base, there's just an irritating spot in the middle. BUT, for the price, they'll do.<br /><br />Update: I must have been in an uncharacteristically forgiving mood the day I wrote this review. I tried using these again last night and they're basically useless. Seeing as how there are many good reviews, maybe the pair I received missed the quality control inspection. Simply put, a good pair of scissors cut, not crimp.\n",
      "6671->Best deodorant I've tried -- and I'm old enough to have tried a LOT of them ... | 5 | 1 | I've been using 5-day Deodorant for years -- the original liquid one with the little pads that you apply directly.  I'm sensitive to some deodorants, but I've never had any problems with this brand.  I decided to give this roll-on a try, and find it works exactly the same as the liquid/pad version.<br /><br />I put it on after I shower and just forget about it.  Although the label says &#34;regular scent,&#34; there's really almost no scent at all -- I'm really REALLY sensitive to scents, and I get no irritation/scratchy throat/etc. from this.  It isn't the cheapest option out there, but I can't find it in the local stores anymore, so ordering online is the only way I can get it.  It's worth it to me.  Will continue to order and use as long as it's available.\n",
      "6678->Efficient portable cleansing | 5 | 1 | Efficient cleansing and vey soft against the skin. Size is perfect for addressing multiple areas of the body with one Body Wipe. The scent is rather mild which is very desirable.<br />An excellent product and strongly recommended..\n",
      "6682->Good to not slip from your hair | 4 | 1 | These headbands are completely necessary for me to live my life these days.  I tried other masks extenders but nothing either stayed put, was comfortable, or actually helped with my mask.  I have a few different types of mask headbands now - as I wear one every time I leave my house.<br /><br />These particular ones are pretty nice!  If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head.  They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain...  The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever.  The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are sort of concave are that because of their pretty design once you put your mask strap on them they sort of lift up and away from the band itself (because of their concaveness) - so sort of stick out a bit.  So the pretty buttons can be a flaw.  But they work just fine - and it is probably me being anal.<br /><br />The buttons are also at a decent placement.  I wish they were the slightest bit lower, though - as that works best for me.  As they are now they are still good - any higher and they would be pulling your nose up by your mask.  The colors (other than the wilder animal print) are muted enough to easily wear to the office as well.  A headband is literally part of my everyday office wear now.  Glad I can add these to my collection of bands!  If you found my review helpful, why not click the \"Helpful\" button.  Thanks! : )\n",
      "6701->product not as illustrated and not effective | 1 | 1 | the illustration is for the original product which I have used in the past.  The product shipped was in a different container, orange color, and I have tried it in the past.  It is not effective.<br /><br />The grey colored package was effective; the orange is not.<br /><br />Will return product.\n",
      "6708->Very Happy | 4 | 1 | The packaging was acceptable and the product as expected.  The clips were easy to use which was good.<br />I like the grip and the teeth that really helps to hold my hair in place.  Overall it a good product.\n",
      "6711->Like washing with a plastic mesh bag | 3 | 1 | This soap balder looks and feels like it is made of those plastic mesh bags that oranges and onions come in at the grocery store.<br />I don’t feel like they are a good “scratchy” or “exfoliating” I feel like I’m trying to wash with a plastic net made to catch rubber duckies.<br />So if you think it might be the rough scrub for you, try washing with a mesh bag for oranges first and see what you think before buying.<br /><br />Is larger than it looks in the picture, will definitely hold a large bar of soap. For me they’re too large, but I fold my washcloths, so I might not be the best judge of that.<br /><br />Did not like. Might use for scrubbing pots and pans?\n",
      "6725->Larger than expected, but works well. | 4 | 1 | They made this out to be pocketable. It's not really, too thick, but it's also not crazy large like the Equigroomer is. I wanted to try this out before seeing if I should buy the equigroomer. OVERALL, impressed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Dual blades, one for short hairs and one for medium-long hairs.<br />-EASY and reliable self-cleaning, retract the blades and easy to pull off the hair, also like how the hair (as long as you don't have a fan or a large gust of wind) stays on the surface of the comb. Making it easy to collect. and dispose of.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-DOESN'T LOCK into position, so, I'd be mid combing my dogs and the blade would slowly crawl back inside and I'd only realize it since it would start to feel smooth, or there wasn't the expected resistance. SO you have to develop a combing method where your thumb sits behind the slider to keep the blades from retracting.<br />-CHUNKY, not bad for IN-HAND feel, but they made this out to be pocketable, it's not. I mean it is if you have baggy pants or cargo pockets. The thing is about 4x2x1 inches. It's that 1in thickness that kind of hurts the pocketability of this. THOUGH, if you're throwing this in a \"CARE\" bag like a pet version of a \"baby\" bag, then this isn't so bulky that it's going to greatly consume space.<br />-Cheap feeling, I know it's not expensive, but it does feel cheap. Like I don't know if this would survive a fall.<br />-Clogging- while I like that the simple act of retracting the blades pushes the hair out, don't know if the tolerance are there to prevent dander and dead skin from building up and clogging it.<br />-Questionable Shorthaired issues. I have one dog that is clearly medium haired, It's a dutch Shepherd lab mix; and the other is a foxhound catahoula. The foxhoud thinks the longer tooth blade is painful, but the shorter toothed blade is too short for it to be useful. The Dutch/Lab dog has zero issue with the longer tooth comb.<br /><br />Tip:<br />-NOW this might be just logical and common sense to some people, but it took me a while to realize. The best results come from using this product PERPENDICULAR _|_ to the body. I was doing a 45 degree angle and it wasn't catching as much. Also, go with the grain of hair growth not against.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I think it's a great travel comb, and it's well worth the sticker price. Short haired dogs may not like it and may make it hard to comb them with it, but medium and long will more than be fine.\n",
      "6732->Strong chemical type scent | 3 | 1 | This stuff smells. A lot. And it lingers for hours. I actually ended up washing my face all over again to get it off before going to sleep.<br /><br />The lotion itself is smooth and didn't irritate my skin. It seems to absorb reasonably fast as well. But....that awful smell is a deal breaker for me.\n",
      "6739->Fun Pack of Butterfly Tattoos | 4 | 1 | These tattoos are fun. There is a ton to pick from and each butterfly is just a little different. They are easy to apply and the sheets they come on are not gigantic so cutting them out is not a huge chore.<br /><br />Application is easy - take off the clear backing, press on skin, wet with a damp cloth for 30 seconds, remove paper.<br /><br />These are the perfect size for a child's party or to give away as a prize.<br /><br />They don't last an infinitely long time, which I'm sure parents would be grateful of.<br /><br />The butterflies that show a shadow clearly in the description do not transfer that way in real life. Those tattoos look more like the butterfly is smudged and not 3D. If this is important to you I would simply cut the shadow part off because it truly does look like a smudge.\n",
      "6745->Great Shampoo w/ Natural Ingredients and No Parabens | 4 | 1 | I really like this Argan Oil shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  I love the fact that it contains some very nourishing ingredients like Argan oil, jojoba oil, camellia seed oil, vanilla and honey.  I also can feel great about using this product knowing there are no parabens and no harsh chemicals to damage my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo comes in a 16 oz. brown plastic bottle with a pump dispenser.  I absolutely loved the shampoo however the dispenser was a total fail.  When I try to pump the product out it comes out of the dispenser as well as the top of the bottle where the pump goes in.  It made a big mess when trying to use the dispenser so I just opted to transfer it to another bottle and use it without the pump.<br /><br />Overall I love the shampoo but the product packaging (the pump in particular) needs some work.  So, for me this product gets 3.75 stars and I'll round up to 4.  If the company works on the dispenser and ensures they work I would give it a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />*A sample of this product was provided to me free for testing and review.  No promise was made for a positive review.\n",
      "6760->These colors are great! | 4 | 1 | I really liked this palette a lot. The colors are bold and beautiful; and a really fun change to my routine for not a lot of money. I found that colors blend out easily and last all day too. I honestly couldn't think of one bad thing to say about this set other than that my palette didn't come sealed. Cosmetic products should always be sealed in my opinion, so I had to deduct a star. But otherwise I would have to recommend it.<br />(soda can included in the photo for size reference)\n",
      "6771->Can’t Use it By Itself | 3 | 1 | I had really high hopes for this product. It looks too dark, shiny, and fake when worn by itself, too much like an actual marker. If it looked more natural by itself, that would be great, because it definitely is smudge proof. It will not smear once it’s on. I like the idea of this product and the fact that it has a forked wand, but was not happy at all with how it looked on my eyebrows without using another product together.<br />I refused to give up on it though. I decided to use brow powder first and then this on top, and that actually worked out a lot better. Kept my brows in place without smearing.\n",
      "6779->Pretty Bottles - Not A Match Though... | 2 | 1 | Bought these bottles to hold lube. The opening is too unreliable to apply. It just squirts out very abruptly, and you can't control it because of how the opening and the bottle were designed.<br />Wouldn't recommend unless you want alot of whatever you put in the bottle to spurt out furiously.\n",
      "6791->Does not Stay on Hair! | 1 | 1 | These were terrible! There were so jumbo sized & heavy that it literally would not stay on my hair. There was no rubber coating to catch hair & keep it from slipping like the Goody Hair clips.<br />And I have thick heavy long hair & it still would not stay on. Therefore had to return for a full refund. The price point was great but not the claw clips. Needs improvement.\n",
      "6799->Great colors that look just like the picture | 5 | 1 | Great colors that look just like the picture. The formula is sooo soft and creamy and very easy to blend. Just make sure you're careful not to blend it all away!<br /><br />Update: The matte bone shade randomly slid out of the palette. Not sure how that happened since I don't take this with me anywhere. I was able to gently nudge it back into the pan and reshape after wetting with alcohol. Weird. Still love this just be extra careful since they're so creamy and soft!\n",
      "6801->Mostly natural | 4 | 1 | I try and use all natural products, in my hair and body care. I was hoping this would be, but there is a sodium laurel sulfate at the end. It's not as bad as most, it's mostly natural, but that is one I prefer not to use in my hair care. I passed the bottle on to my friend who normally uses pantene, so it was a lot healthier for her to use less chemicals over all.<br /><br />Her hair looks great and the shampoo smells fine. It has a soapy smell, which is fine. It goes on fine, she said she used one pump for medium length hair, and it washed up fine. Her hair looks nice, it's clean and looks soft and shiny.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.\n",
      "6822->Awful | 1 | 1 | Tried it for a week. It barely does anything for volume, and I couldn't make it 20 minutes after application before it started crumbling and getting into my eyes. It just existed by my eyeballs and chose violence.<br /><br />I specifically get waterproof makeup in case something happens and I cry, and this didn't hold up. I went from crying from a real injury to crying from this crud getting into my eyes.<br />Do not buy this.\n",
      "6823->Excellent Serum for all skin types | 5 | 1 | I am a Product Tester and was offered this Anti-Aging Serum by Sublime at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback. I can honestly say that I love this product. It's a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams. (But that's just my personal opinion) I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.<br /><br />I have been using this wonderful serum 3 times a week and the results are astounding! It's nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent. It's worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines I've started to notice. It has also helped clear up my skin by unclogging my pores. Sublime contains glycolic acid and salicylic acid which are natural fruit ingredients with exfoliating properties that encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells improving the tone and texture of my skin. My skin looks radiant and more youthful.<br /><br />It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Sublime works very well and has become part of my skin care routine. If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Your skin will thank you!\n",
      "6827->Good for sensitive skin | 5 | 1 | This gel sunscreen is perfect for sensitive skin like me. I love it more than ANESSA one.<br />I highly recommend it.\n",
      "6835->Waste of money, color is way off | 2 | 1 | I usually buy the color Vanilla in Too Faced foundations and this one is SOO yellow. It makes me look sick like I have jaundice.<br /><br />Other than that the smell is a little overbearing (and I typically like their scented lines). It’s quite thick, very creamy. Not as dewy as I thought it would be.<br /><br />Regardless, none of it matter because the color is so atrocious.\n",
      "6839->Does NOT work! | 1 | 1 | Sad to report that this product does not work. I had very high hopes and did not mind paying the price tag as long as it worked as a deodorant. Took shower, put some deodorant straight out of the shower and a few minutes later it was as if I was not wearing any deodorant. Does not smell much like lime, even the unscented one has a scent, but not pleasant.<br /><br />The deodorant is more like a cream/paste rather than a firm texture so it gets everywhere.\n",
      "6846->A mix of good and bad | 3 | 1 | A couple weeks ago, I started going to a new stylist. I was telling her about my struggles to find a good shampoo. My roots are greasy, but the rest is pretty dry. I have tried so many sulfate free shampoos. But I’ve found they either don’t clean well or they strip and dry my hair. I was recommended this shampoo and conditioner. I don’t usually use conditioner because it is a major pain to rinse out and tends to weigh down my hair. I have fine hair and a lot of it. The stylist suggested that I only use a dime sized amount and rub it between my hands to emulsify it. You only need a tiny amount of the conditioner too. At first, I really liked both, but now I have very mixed feelings. I also have very allergy prone skin.<br /><br />The Good<br />Only need a very small amount<br />Easy to rinse out<br />A light, clean smell<br /><br />The Bad<br />At first, I liked this shampoo and conditioner a lot. But the longer I use it, the less I like it. My scalp is really itchy, and I feel like my hair doesn’t get very clean. It still seems greasy even after washing it twice. It also seems to be stripping and drying out my hair. It just doesn’t look very nice. It also seems a lot more frizzy. I haven’t decided if I’m going to finish the bottles or just toss them. When I go back, maybe I will try Alluram instead. So disappointed.\n",
      "6855->This is not only the best natural/organic liquid eyeliner | 5 | 1 | This is not only the best natural/organic liquid eyeliner, but also the best liquid eyeliner I have used in general. I have been slowly switching all my beauty products to natural products for health reasons and was worried I wouldn't be able to find a good eyeliner that didn't smear or cause &#34;racoon&#34; eyes. This product stays on all day and night and does not need reapplication throughout the day. It's waterproof, so it's a little more difficult to remove at the end of the day like most waterproof makeup products in general. Also, one of these eyeliners lasted me 3 months of almost everyday wear!<br /><br />My only suggestion is the brand name be written on the label of the product. I received this from a friend as a gift for my birthday and it took me awhile to find it again because there was no name listed on the label!\n",
      "6878->Man Sized Minty Lip Balm | 5 | 1 | I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It is man sized and will last a long time. He is using it now in the winter but I hear it is heat stable in the summer as well so he can leave it in the car. This tube is about three times the size of Burt's Bees lip balm. So if you want to make a man in your life happy this is the thing to buy. Chapped lips are no fun. This solves a big problem year round and is minty fresh too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "6882->so much smaller than the description | 5 | 1 | when i bought this I was considering this or one of the all in one handheld.  glad I went with this.<br />As you can see in the picture,this is much more compact than the photos the company provides. Not super compact but fits on my bathroom counter nicely.<br />For setup, charge first.  You have to take the cable out of the back to get it to work. The tank looks pretty small, but it goes a long way.  I use this about every other night and I have not recharged the battery or added more water except when I wanted the water to be warm. I have sensitive gums and the warm water seems to be less harsh than cold water.<br />I have stayed on the lowest setting and it gets out a lot of gunk.  This will make a mess! if you close your mouth then you are pretty good but if you open your mouth water goes everywhere. there is a button on the handle to turn the water off (maybe I will use it when i clean my teeth).<br />this is pretty loud when you run it, not sure if i would want to use it with other people too close.  but if you want to travel with this, its pretty compact and has a little carry bag. most of the items store in the lid so that is pretty handy.<br />if you have been looking for a water pik type device, give this a try.  use if for a couple weeks and see what you think!\n",
      "6891->Reasonably Effective Flat Iron | 4 | 1 | This flat iron is versatile in that it's effective on dry hair as well as wet - usually I avoid straightening my hair when it's dry out of fear that it will damage my hair. In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but I like the versatility of the dry hair option.\n",
      "6892->Spa Nirvana | 5 | 1 | Body butter is the perfect after-bath treat for your skin. Zia body butter is a combination of shea butter and mango butter blended into a smooth lemon yellow moisturizer that could become a hand cream essential.<br /><br />This cream is super luxurious to use in the winter and is one of the few products with myrrh essential oil.<br /><br />Ingredients: Infusion of organic aloe vera extract, organic ginko biloba extract, organic elder extract, organic chamomile extract, caprylic/capric triglyceride, stearic acid, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, safflower oil, shea butter, mango butter, polysorbate 60, stearyl alcohol, sweet almond oil, tocopherol, beta carotene, rosehip seed oil, cucumber extract, green tea extract, algae extract, sodium carbomer, lavender essential oil, myrrh essential oil, neroli essential oil, vetiver essential oil, benzoin gum, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben.<br /><br />Zia body butter is a rich moisturizing cream that absorbs fast and leaves your skin looking smooth and deeply moisturized.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "6913->Cute, but too tight | 4 | 1 | These headbands are really cute and are of good quality. Unfortunately, the headbands are pretty tight and leave quite the dent in her little 3 month old head (her head measures about the average size for a 3 month old). It doesn't seem to bug her, but I don't like the unsightly pink dent going around her little head. You also have to be extra careful when putting them on to make sure they don't flick because they are made out of stretchy elastic.<br /><br />Update: as my baby grew more hair I used these a bit more. I love the variety of colors and ability to dress them up or down. These headbands look great in photos (as long as the pink dent isn't showing ;) ). I have grown to like them more over time.\n",
      "6934->The reviews complaining about the pump are correct | 3 | 1 | I read the reviews about the pump not working and ordered anyway, after being told the pump comes off--I figured I could just open up the jar and dip a sponge or foundation brush in it, so that would be no big deal.<br /><br />I underestimated how annoying it would be to take the pump off. It comes apart in sections and I gave up halfway, because I was going to be late for work if I stood around MacGyvering it much longer.<br /><br />I was able to get some product out and try it. It's very thick and kind of dry. I ended up mixing it with moisturizer in order to get the little bit I had to spread sufficiently.<br />The color is good--I am very very fair and the Ivory is light enough, and not yellow.<br />I will update my review after I use it for a week or so. I suspect the consistency and the packaging may combine to bring this down  a star or two.\n",
      "6948->2 months.  Doesn't work | 1 | 1 | Thought it was ok for traveling,  however it already no n longest works<br />Save your money\n",
      "6953->It’s Insane to Keep Trying | 3 | 1 | “The definition of ‘insanity’ is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”<br /><br />Apocryphally attributed to the late, great Albert Einstein (among other famous historical figures), that cogent adage perfectly describes my reaction to this RUNWE Rechargeable Cordless Rotary Shaver with Pop-Up Trimmer.<br /><br />I’ve shaved with a blade for my entire adult life, mainly because I have a fetish for close, smooth shaves. No electric shaver that I’ve ever tried, reciprocating or rotary, has been able to shave as smooth as I like. The few other electric shavers that I’ve gotten through the Vine program didn’t work for me because they didn’t shave close enough. But hope springs eternal, right?<br /><br />Sadly, however, I was doomed to disappointment again.<br /><br />Oh, this shaver is lightweight enough, with a nice, firm, rubber-like grip that makes it very easy and secure to handle. The power switch slides smoothly and authoritatively into the ON and OFF positions (although the reason for the little locking button escapes me). The three rotary heads articulate to track the contours of the face, and they whirl very quietly. The pop-up trimmer is a nice feature if you need it.<br /><br />But it just doesn’t shave close enough for me. It’s not better or worse than other electric shavers I’ve tried—it’s the same, in that it leaves a detectable stubble that I don’t want. If you favor the five-o’-clock shadow look, then it may work for you, but don’t expect it to match a blade shave.<br /><br />Here’re two more observations: 1) I plugged in for at least 12 hours, and the red CHARGING light never went out, even though the instruction manual says charging time is 8 hours. I assume the light was supposed to go out when it was fully charged (the manual doesn’t say), but mine never did; 2) Speaking of the manual—the step-by-step guide is fairly detailed, if a bit lacking in describing some features, but the illustrations are 20 tiny, half-inch-square, dark-gray-shaded, white-line, icon-like drawings crammed in a grid arrangement onto one page of the 3-by-5 inch booklet. I needed a bright flashlight and a magnifying lens to make them out. YMMV, of course. I mean, using an electric shaver is not rocket science, but geez, why can’t the manufacturer at least TRY to convey information in a useable way?<br /><br />If you’re looking for a close shave, you may have to draw the same conclusion that I did after I confirmed the definition of “insanity” by trying this electric shaver after having had no success with several others. Bottom line—they just don’t cut it for me.\n",
      "6957->Love it and a healthier alternative to eye-drops | 4 | 1 | Keeps both skin and eyes moisturized. Sterilized and tissue-safe water.<br /><br />Comes with two bottles. Love it and a healthier alternative to eye-drops. The facial-spray bottle can be re-used with desired water.\n",
      "6963->cold jade feels good on face | 4 | 1 | Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better. In my 40s with barely emerging fine lines, I am all for doing what I can to keep those at bay.<br /><br />As I learn anything new, I will add to my review.\n",
      "6980->Good quality exfoliant | 4 | 1 | The only reason I put 4 instead of 5 stars is it advertises all natural. Anything with that much brightness usually has added coloring and the ingredients lists a bunch of fancy things we can't understand which are basically manmade oils. It does exfoliate but it is not a hydrating exfoliant with its main feature being it is mostly of a salt consistency. And salt is meant to dry out. If you're looking for an exfoliant to help with ingrown hairs, brighten skin and get out dirt it is a good product. Exfoliant is also great for healed tattoos to keep that new brightness.<br />The smell is great, the consistency of the sand is good quality, and the packaging is very hygiene conscious and comes with multiple sealants so you know no one has opened your product.\n",
      "6986->Nice Shades, Great for Lazy People (Fewer Touch Ups) | 4 | 1 | Yes, the packaging is gimmicky and I totally fell for it, but I make no apologies.  I bought 3 shades--PK01, CR01, and OR01--and they're all quite nice.  That said, the PK01 is a bit lighter than I expected so I'll probably get more wear out of the other two.<br /><br />The tints are pretty long-lasting.  I was able to wear the OR01 all day yesterday, and even through lunch and drinking mugs of tea I didn't need to touch it up 'til the end of the day.  (And, truthfully, since it was the end of the day and there was still a hint of color, I was lazy and just didn't bother.)  The tints aren't noticeably drying, either--although I'm a balm addict and usually put some on over the color throughout the day.  Luckily, this doesn't seem to have a terribly detrimental effect on the color.  There is a slight taste, which is neither unpleasant nor pleasant--I didn't especially like it, but it didn't bother me.  I'm not a wine drinker, but my guess is they don't really taste like wine, just kind of fruity.<br /><br />The only other true tints/stains I've used are the Tony Moly ones and I think these compare favorably to those in terms of ease of application (I think these are more forgiving), durability, drying, and taste (the TMs had a more chemical taste).  I don't dislike the TM's, but these are just better, IMO.<br /><br />I'd recommend these tints, and will probably buy again, especially to try out the other other colors.\n",

      "7053->Wafer-thin portable soap; dissolves instantly; good lather; fragrance does not come thru on hands | 4 | 1 | There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.\n",
      "7089->Big Bar Of Soap! | 5 | 1 | I have been using this soap for the last 5 days and wanted to use it that long to see if it works for me. I have sensitive skin on my face that is prone to breakouts no matter how much the company says it is for sensitive skin. I have minor adult acne and still hate it. I just want clear skin...is that not too much to ask? Well, after just 5 days, I see a major improvement around my t-zone and chin area that normally breaks out with everything new I try. I did have one bump that showed up and drew a white head but only lasted a day at the most before it dried up. This is my first time ever using an African black soap and always heard good things about it, and so happy I tried it. This is a really BIG bar of soap that I've cut into smaller pieces so that it last longer. I use it on my arms, legs, and face only. So far, doing wonders. I no longer have dried out skin to where I have to immediately put on lotion after showering. Totally worth trying out, even just once!<br /><br />I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\n",

It's products are among those always listed in a search of \"what skincare should I buy while in Paris\" or \"What items should I buy at at French pharmacy?\"<br /><br />This travel kit with the favorite products is a relatively inexpensive way to try a range of Caudalie skincare and their distinctive ingredients. The brand is known for their use of the grapeseeds from a vineyard and discovering the antioxidants help to combat aging and free radicals.  This kit has some of their more expensive creams in small doses, so you can try the range of creams (Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource and the famous Beauty Elixir and Instant Foaming Cleanser.  It comes in a zippered tote perfect for traveling.  I love this set and plan to get one for my mother. While we can't travel during this covid pandemic, we can look forward to traveling together in the future. It's a gift of skincare and a promise of future adventures.\n",
      "7092->Love Easydew | 5 | 1 | I've been using Easydew products for a while and every products works on my skin really well!<br />Their pricing is reasonable but yet effective!<br />This cleanser is generous size and last for a while.<br />I have sensitive skin but it didn't cause any irritation or redness so that's good.<br />I just started using it so I'll update the review in a month or so!\n",
      "7121->Soft, bouncy and defined curls...So good so far | 4 | 1 | I've only had this hair for about a week but I must say so far so good. It came in two days, presented very nicely, it does have a lil factory smell but nothing a co-wash can't get rid of. I washed it and dried it, not hanging but just dropped on my heater and the curl pattern stayed soft and bouncy. This is my first deep curly hair and it hasn't shed as much as I expected it to based on what friends have said about curly hair. I bought the hair for a wig but changed my mind last minute and did an updo with the 18 and 16 inch. It looks good with my natural hair and the curls are defined. I've worn the hair for 5 days straight and look forward to good things from it.<br />I'll update my review in a month or so\n",
      "7123->The bottle is way smaller than the free sample @ the hotels :( | 2 | 1 | This battle is way smaller than the free sample @ the hotels :(<br />Beautiful scant & feels nice on the face. It also absorbs well. But none of it matters when the amount needed to be used to see any improvement is 50× greater than this mini- smurf for- bottle is providing. Disappointed in the size & price for it. This should be a free sample & not the overpriced product.\n",
      "7125->One Star | 1 | 1 | do not like it, This product is covered with rust.<br />The description says that the stainless steel product.\n",
      "7128->Decent enough box of goodies - was expecting more from it, though | 3 | 1 | This is cute enough and I am sure if you gave it as a gift a recipient would be appreciative.  I have a problem in that NONE of the contents have ingredients listed, though.  So, although the soap looks beautiful and fancy – I do not know what is in it or what it is made of.  Same goes for the bath bombs – no ingredients whatsoever.  (One I like the smell of – the other not so much.)  Because of this these items definitely come off dollar store-like.  The wine tumbler seems well made and comes with a straw and straw brush.  The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible.  The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper.  Now the wine bottle topper “looks” nice but it is 100% plastic – worse than dollar store...  It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all.  Yet it is a bottle top opener – for beer…  That is so weird to me and I will be taking this out before gifting this gift set as no wine I know of has a pop top – twist off sure – but beer cap?  For the price, they need to truly step it up in regards to the contents - include ingredients and include a better wine stopper.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )\n",
      "7132->Deceitful photo describing product. | 2 | 1 | The pot is three times the size it needs to be.<br />The product fills up about 1/4.<br />Seems like there is way too little product for the cost.\n",
      "7133->Very good eye make-up remover | 4 | 1 | When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed is the cap that’s not a cap, it’s more of a device that keeps the pump from being depressed in shipping. I’d prefer a cap that covers the entire top of the bottle.<br /><br />Vegan Mia Facial Cleansing Oil & Makeup Remover is VERY oily. I cleansed my face following the directions, using 5 pumps of oil instead of the recommended 8 to 10. When I tried to wipe it off with a warm wet towel as instructed, it left my face feeling like it was still covered with oil. I resisted the temptation to wash it off and let it dry. Afterwards my skin felt hydrated and soft. Nice, but it’s not something I’d do every day.<br /><br />I do like it as a makeup remover; a few drops of oil on a cotton ball, pad or swab does a great job of removing eye makeup, especially mascara. I follow up with a non-oily facial cleanser. I also like it’s light, piney scent\n",
      "7135->Lovely scented products. | 4 | 1 | Such a wonderful deal!  I received a sample of the the lotion and used it as a hand cream whenever I was out socializing.<br />Friends would always comment on how lovely the scent of my hand cream was...It's only Suave, I would say.  I think many<br />of my friends have been sold on the lotion.  I'm enjoying each of these products.\n",
      "7140->Take your chances but I wasn’t happy about it | 1 | 1 | Not what I expected at all<br />I should get my money back 🤷🏼‍♀️\n",
      "7146->Wonderful! | 5 | 1 | This is a thick, rich cream that, for me, has worked wonders on dry, scaly skin. My hands needed some serious help and after using this cream for just a few days, I have seen much improvement. My skin is much soft, the cracks are disappearing, and they feel moisturized. The cream is thick, a little goes a long way, and I’ve found it’s best to really rub it in, not list skim it over the skin and leave it. I have also been using the cream on a particularly itchy patch of skin on my back, again, with excellent results.<br />There is no scent.<br />The cream is made from several natural ingredients, most notably Manuka honey from New Zealand, something new to me, but that has been used for centuries in New Zealand. I’m glad it made its way to me in the USA!\n",
      "7151->Nice Brush | Similar To We Love Doodles & Chris Christensen | Cats Love It | Easily Removes Hair | 4 | 1 | If I didn't already own & love my \"We Love Doodles\" brand of big slicker brush, I would have rated this brush at a full 5 stars. Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />🐱For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />🐰I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />🐰Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />🐇Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />🐇I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure. So far I like all three.<br /><br />Chris Christensen: Made in Germany $75.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product//B00KAJTPZ2<br /><br />We Love Doodles: Made in USA $29.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G981NXV<br /><br />Rita's: Made in China $36.99\n",

Sadly, that isn't the case.  One use turned my face red, itchy, and greasy.  I was very disappointed and ended up returning the product the next day.  If you have sensitive skin, this is probably not the moisturizer for you.\n",

      "7164->Don't believe the hype | 1 | 1 | Blah, blah blah. All social media abuzz<br />Caramel color liquid in a heavy bottle, and an added teenage type of body spray.  This has a light vanilla smell that doesn't stay, project or last.<br />Cannot return, even in COVD times where I cannot smell this anywhere. Can't contact seller.  Run\n",
      "7170->Not for sensitive skin | 2 | 1 | Burned my lids n under my eyes. Love the feel and so disappointed that I’m back to the drawing board. My eyelids r bright red n feel like they are on fire<br />But that’s just me. My skin is extremely sensitive. On a better note I did see that the puffiness  was going down. So if you’re skin is not sensitive I’d give it a try\n",
      "7179->HAD TO RETURN:  I LOVED this and it did not hold up long term. | 2 | 1 | UPDATE:  I have only had this a short time and will return it as the attachments will not lock into place and fall off during use. Since this gets hot it is a bit of a hazard to me. Attachment has gotten stuck in my hair when it fell off.<br /> I may try ordering it again and see what happens.<br /><br />Original Review: This is the right size to add curl to your hair where many of these are just so large it is not possible. Another product I bought was great but was simply too large to do anything but straighten hair.  This has that attachment too but the round one is wonderful.\n",
      "7185->Nice set that clears up counter space while keeping teeth healthy. | 5 | 1 | I am a Sonicare user for a long time and have had three different models over the years.<br />The tooth brush here is pretty standard for Sonicare.  2 minute timer with 30 second interval alert.<br /><br />Its a little fatter than most of their latest models but not at all a hindrance  This means its a nickel metal hydryde battery vs the lithium ion in the newest versions.<br /><br />The real news is in the flosser. I've used Waterpiks off and on over the years and always had good results.  The downside was always the container that had to be stored on the counter top.<br /><br />After using this for several weeks I can say that it is very handy and works well.  The handle is fairly large and much bigger  and  heavier than a Waterpik handle which took a bit of getting used to.  In general I would say its a bit of a draw between the two with the edge going to the Sonicare for the ability to clean it and store it quickly without taking up any counter space.<br /><br />All in this kit is also less expensive than buying the pieces separately. However the trade off there is the bigger handle and weight of the tooth brush.\n",
      "7198->*****5 STARS PLUS***** | 5 | 1 | I have dry frizzy hair so naturally I Love shampoo's & Conditioner's loaded with Argan Oil.  I have been using both the shampoo & conditioner for about a month now and my hair is already looks more healthy, shiny & less frizzy.  I Love purchasing Premium Nature products, they go the extra mile to ensure their customers are receiving the best all natural ingredients possible.  Below is their list of ingredients just in the conditioner alone.<br />Conditioner: Water, Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Vitamin B5, Glycerin, Glycine Betaine, Climbazole, Fragrance<br />Shampoo:Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Methyl Cocyl Taurate, Sodium Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocyl Glutamate, Acrylates Copolymer CocoGlucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Argania Spinosa ( Argan Oil ), Phytokeratin, Prunus Persica (Peach Kernel Oil), Prunus Dulcis ( Almond Oil), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Pseudocollagen, Camelia Sinensis (Camellia Seed Oil), Persea Americana(Avocado Oil), Fragrance.<br />I have found the longer you leave the conditioner on your hair, the better results you will have.  I will be a returning customer!!\n",
      "7220->Love the blender sponges but I am not crazy about the brush | 3 | 1 | There is one recessed foundation brush in this set along with three blender sponges.<br /><br />The brush is not high quality. I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag. Note that the packaging is more than double the size of the products within. I can fit three sets of these in the box it came in.\n",
      "7223->This must have been a Man's idea, it never would pass the test of a woman | 2 | 1 | in order to spread  the foundation on your face using dots  as shown you have to really push & pull on your skin to accomplish that.<br />Unless you're under 25 yrs old..you don't want to be pushing & pulling on your facial skin,<br />I think this is a terrible product for that reason alone.\n",
      "7229->Nice starter kit | 4 | 1 | Review for: Gel Nail Polish Kit With U V LED Light Nail Kit With 150W Nail Lamp 10 Colors Soak Off Gel Polish Nail Art Salon & Starter Kit With Rhinestones Glitters Manicure Tool Kit<br /><br />This is a great starter kit for anyone new to doing their own gel nails. It includes a full sized LED light, something not all kits do. You get a lot of smaller tools and accessories in this kit and you also get 10 colors of polish as well as well as a top coat and base.<br /><br />The polish itself has a nice consistency and the handles of the brushes are easy to use. They come with the colored dots on tops of the handles. I did remove one star from my review because two of the bottles of polish did not have their lids on tight and my kit arrived with two leaking polish bottles and a mess to clean up. This is a QA issue, not a packing issue as everything was packed with care.\n",
      "7231->One drawback is that the oil gets into our glasses and smears easily. Be careful of the oil around the eyes | 4 | 1 | This has a lot of natural oils in it and my skin loves it--drinks up the moisturizing effects. I did not burn at all when I used it.<br /><br />One drawback is that the oil gets into our glasses and smears easily. Be careful of the oil around the eyes.\n",
      "7260->Grips so well, it doesn't want to come off! | 3 | 1 | So these are good in that they hold fine hair very well, but with that grip, as others have stated, comes the unenviable task of getting it out of the hair. You can roll it out, however that will wind any wayward hairs around it and result in a yank.<br /><br />If anyone should use this, I would recommend it for someone with very fine, straight hair, not prone to any type of flyaways. Also, you'll want to make sure that you flatten down any frizz or flyaways before rolling it out over the pony. It can be done, but I'm not sure it's worth all the effort and toil.<br /><br />I put it into my daughter's hair wet, with a silicone serum in it overnight. Even though her hair was sleek and still in the pony completely, the removal was problematic. I am sticking with the grippy Goody pony holders, although I am curious if they'll make design improvements, because there is potential. Her pony held well and it was super easy to put it in.\n",
      "7264->Buy some glue with it. | 1 | 1 | Ordered one, it came in with the Handle broken off, so I put in for an exchange, the second one also came in with the handle broken off..<br />it also sheds bristles a lot.\n",
      "7267->small for an adult | 4 | 1 | Fits small,but stays firm.<br />Serves the purpose for its price.<br /><br />This line is irrelevant to the review and is written to fill in required number of words to submit the review.\n",
      "7274->Good brush but not worth since they stop working so easily | 2 | 1 | Well, to start out with. Electric tooth brushes are the way to go and no one does it better than Philips. Even this one which is their lowest cost one is very very good. The problem is I've had to replace mine about 4 times because water gets into the battery compartment. When you open it its a disgusting mess of gooey water mixed with metal etc. You can clean this out and replace the batteries and it MIGHT work again. In my experience it does not work and if it does it dies after a while. The hatch at the bottom always comes off and does not stay in place which is what leads to it getting water inside.<br />I am finally fed up with it and now that I think of it having paid for 4 of these (beginning from when they were much pricier than now) I have paid well over $100 for these, when I could have just bought the more expensive, rechargeable (MUCH battery for the environment too), and overall better toothbrushes they have. Trust me and make the investment and buy the more expensive ones.\n",

      "7303->Organized all my daily wear makeup into on easy to use area. | 5 | 1 | This acrylic makeup organizer by MelodySusie is part of my ongoing effort to get myself more organized. Until recently my makeup was an absolutely disaster. I finally got sick of that and decided something needed to be done, so after gathering everything up (and culling a huge amount that I just do not use any more) I started sorting and putting things into this organizer. With several drawers and compartments it was easy to arrange everything in a compact space so I could still see everything. I also really liked the flexibility that this organizer offers. I currently have the dividers in place in the bottom drawer since I am using it to keep my most often worn pairs of earrings easily accessible, but if I were to ever get more makeup I could remove the dividers and use the drawer as it, and setthe divider on the counter on its own to hold additional items.<br /><br />The organizer itself seems to be well made - nice and sturdy with parts that fit together well and are well finished so there are no rough jagged edges. The included drawer liners are a nice touch and they help to keep things from rolling or rattling around each time I open and close a drawer. I like that the top section is a separate unit that can be removed as this makes cleaning much easier. I wear powdered foundation (that famous brand that you swirl and tap) and particles of it seem to get into everything. With a removable top tray, when it needs a deep cleaning I can just remove all my makeup from it and rinse it under the faucet without messing up the items that are in the drawers. That's not possible to do with an all in one unit where the top tray is attached to the base drawers.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy wih this organizer. It works very well for my makeup, though I can also see it working well for other uses. As an artist I can see it working very well in my studio to organize art supplies as well.<br /><br />I did receive this item at no cost for the purposes of testing and review. All opinions are based on my personal experiences using the item.\n",
      "7307->YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR | 3 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:1689b2a05a56cafc65bab020a09f6792]] Very weird smelling pink  plastic carrying case .<br />Handles to the brushes are cheaply made .<br />Brushes ARE soft & pretty pink but very cheap at that . Decent product\n",
      "7314->It works! | 5 | 1 | FINALLY a natural, aluminum free deodorant that works and works well!<br />I use this right after I shower and it lasts for at least two days for me. No other natural deodorant has done that for me. It keeps smells at bay and even stops the sweating.<br />In fact, this deodorant works even better that an antiperspirant deodorant!<br />For me it’s definitely a match!\n",
      "7343->Great skincare line | 4 | 1 | I really like this line. I see improvements using the exfoliating scrub, the toning serum and my favorite is the hydra-whipped moisturizer.  The scrub and the serum are also sold separately in full size bottles but the hydra-whipped is not and I'm so hoping it will be in the future. It absorbs without a trace of residue and the benefits are long lasting.<br />The only thing that did not wow me was the eye cream. It is pretty basic, offers some hydration.\n",
      "7352->Citrus Scented Gel | 5 | 1 | If you have sensitive skin and dislike the abrasive quality of most exfoliating washes, then the Start Up Exfoliating Wash may impress you.<br /><br />The clean smooth feeling of the citrus scented gel is a pleasure for your face. You are actually exfoliating with the natural fruit acids in this product. There are also anti-inflammatory ingredients and astringent properties.<br /><br />Some of the natural ingredients: Lavender, Rosemary, Sage, Red Clover, Golden Seal, Juniper Berries, Lemon Balm, Aloe Vera, Extracts of green Tea, Apple, Sugar Cane, Orange Oil, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, tangerine, Clementine and Lemongrass.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "7363->Natural look,  light weight but .... | 3 | 1 | Wore them for 10 hrs. No lifting at all. Used the liner in the tube. Easy to apply. Dries shiny; hard to tell when it’s dry. Applied 2 thin coats with at least 5 min dry time between (did my hair and brows in between). I had to cut the extra plastic off both ends or plastic would have poked me. I tried it but very painful.  Not as comfortable as invisible or cloth bands but more durable and longer lasting. I wear contacts and they did turn my eyes red for about 3 hrs and then I completely forgot I had them on.<br />Glue removal:: tried oil based eye makeup removes—- didn’t work; lots of rubbing. Ultimately used my lancome eye make up remover which made the process quick!!<br />Nice for the price but not a go to lash for me.\n",
      "7367->Hydrating lotion but am not too crazy about the eucalyptus scent | 3 | 1 | There is a lot of lotion (3.38 fluid ounces) for the $24 price tag. This lotion is creamy and very hydrating. It also absorbs quickly. Unfortunately, I am not at all crazy about the eucalyptus scent. If I loved the scent, this would have received 5 stars from me.<br /><br />BTW, this is good for a man or a woman despite what the title says.\n",
      "7390->the best I've tried! | 4 | 1 | I have tried nearly a dozen different sleep masks, and this is my favorite. It manages to block the light without gaping, and manages to keep from pressing on my eyes without any of the annoying padding or buldging cups I've experenced on others, which allows me to sleep comfortably in my sides. The material has remained silky after years of use. I also like the adjustable velcro strap.<br /><br />I bought a new one recently as a back-up and was disappointed to find it scented, especially since I use it mainly for my migraines! However, with nothing to lose, I put it through my washing machine on \"cold\" and air-dried it. After that one wash, the scent was gone, and doesn't irrtate my very sensitive skin.<br /><br />You cannot beat this mask for comfort and effectiveness, especially for this price. still, give yourself enough time before needing it to throw it through the washing machine.\n",
      "7405->Chocolate scent… huge bottle | 4 | 1 | First, this treatment is profesional use… I can seee that because definitely I couldn’t do it by myself! It is not a simple or fast process.<br />The liquid has a very strong chocolate scent which I prefer over any more chemical scent.<br />You need to follow the instructions very well.<br />I have very thin, short natural wavy hair and I think we did something wrong along the way… hahaha…<br />Although my hair does feel softer and shinier. But I don’t have a “Brazilian straight”.<br />The liquid is chocolate also in color but I did not see any difference in my own hair. So it did not dye it.<br />Is a good product, and if you are like me, not super handy with brush and hair dryer, you better ask for help so you can follow through the steps.\n",
      "7411->Not for Scent-Sensitive People | 1 | 1 | In the interest of full disclosure, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I generally find some good in the products I buy, so I rarely give such low reviews; however, this product had to be the exception. The smell was terrible.  The gel was the overwhelming smell of dollar store floor cleaner: a powdery, artificial flower smell. I applied it to my face anyway, because sometimes good products have bad fragrances that quickly dissipate, and you can continue to use the product. That wasn't the case for this gel. The smell was not only bad, it was also strong.<br /><br />The scent lasted for over an hour until I washed the product off. I wish I could tell you how it actually performed, but I get migraines that can be induced by certain smells/perfumes, and the smell of this product qualified. That was enough to dissuade me from wanting to use it again. If you're sensitive to certain smells, I would recommend that you avoid this eye gel, unless I somehow received a defective one.<br /><br />If you're not sensitive to smells, then this product might be fine for you, but I can't weigh in on that.\n",
      "7420->Maybe I'm Just A Swamp Queen | 2 | 1 | But this just doesn't work for me. Backstory: I've been on natural deodorants for about two months now (so I'm already detoxed out - and past that gross phase). I'm on the search for a deodorant that works. This doesn't do it for me at all. I smell like a lavender/vanilla candle went on vacation to (insert stinky country here) and ran a marathon.<br />I don't feel like I'm an overtly disgusting person, but I feel completely unprotected and stinky with this deodorant.<br />The search is still on!<br />(It could be my body chemistry just doesn't work with this product, it could be the fact that I'm in Honduras and it's HOT! But I've also tried another brand that has worked better for me, so expectations are realistic.)\n",
      "7421->Just as described | 5 | 1 | This moisturizer is great.<br />Wish the availability was better.\n",
      "7456->Excellent moisturizer..absorbs quickly..non greasy | 5 | 1 | Use it daily and a moisturizer .absorbs<br />Quickly .\n",
      "7462->Great color, watch the applicator | 4 | 1 | This color is lovely and sheer.<br />The applicator requires some attention, it’s very easy for too much to come out, but I’ve figured out how to avoid wasting any product.\n",
      "7463->Perfect for people who want something other than floss | 5 | 1 | I have been purchasing these brush picks for several years and recently I was unable to find them in our local pharmacy.  Fortunately, Amazon carried these picks and I like them so much, I ordered a dozen.<br /><br />They are really great picks.  I do not like to floss.  It, to me, is messy and if I use the unwaxed floss, it gets caught in my teeth.  I will use it from time to time, but mainly I use these after every meal and they work perfectly to remove plaque and other build-up.  My dental hygienist even remarked at how little work she has to do to remove plaque at my 6 month check-ups and I really believe that it is due to proper brushing, of course, but these brushpicks as well.  My dentist and the hygienist always ask me how often I floss and my same response is that I use the brushpicks and not floss. I am not sure they believe me.<br /><br />Both of us in the house keep a pack in our respective cars to have them handy. They are a very good product.\n",
      "7468->Formula changed and now it is painful to have on | 2 | 1 | I have used it for a couple weeks now, so far I like it. It did make me break out in the beginning but I feel this is more the product drawing out all the junk in my pores, as this effect has died down and my pores are a lot more clear now. If this result remains then I will buy the product again!<br /><br />Update:<br />I have continued to use it for a little over a month now and absolutely love it. As I suspected the initial small break out I experienced was just the product getting the junk out of my pores and it was only temporary. After using this product every day my face has been and stayed clearer than ever, my pores visibly smaller because they are not clogged which in turn has made my skin appear smoother. I have also experienced less hormonal break outs which is wonderful! The only concern I have is that I just re ordered it and the new bottle smells differently than the first bottle. The first bottle did not have a pleasant smell to it but that did not bother me as long as it did what it said. This new bottle smells more of peppermint and the non pleasant smell is no longer there. The increase in peppermint does cause my face to slightly tingle/burn. The bottles are the same as are the ingredients listed but clearly there is a different balance of ingredients in the new bottle. I hope this does not change the effectiveness of the product. So for right now I am going to keep it at 4 stars, if it continues to work I will up it to 5.<br /><br />Another update:  OK so the peppermint overload is seriously painful. There is a slight burning to the skin, thankfully I do not have sensitive skin so it doesnt leave my skin red or irritated but it is painful while the product is on my face. Also it makes my eyes red and they water constantly while it is on my face....Seriously bummed out because I really liked the effectiveness of the product. If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.....I have since dropped my rating from 4 stars to 2. It is still keeping my pores clear so it does still work.<br />Skin Background:<br />  Combination Dry/Oily in the T zone<br />  Had adolescent Acne (not cystic)<br />  Have Adult Acne<br />  34 years old\n",
      "7475->Not actually 105 g of hair | 1 | 1 | I'm not happy with this hair and I'm confused why everyone on here is raving about it. The hair is super thin. They advertise 105 g of hair but I took my scale out and they're weighing that with the clips sewn in. I weight an individual spare clip that came with the set and it came in at 2 g. There are 18 clips sewn into the wefts. So you are really only getting 69 g of hair.<br /><br />I've bought the Euronext ones from Sally's and theirs is better. The hair is uniform from top to bottom. These are very thin at the ends.<br /><br />Get what you pay for, unfortunately!\n",
      "7480->Bribery only works if you have something to bribe with... | 3 | 1 | So apparently scrunchies are back in style? Anyway, I was coerced into buying these, and they turned out to be a great value for the price.<br /><br />To put it into perspective, a single velvet scrunchie at Claire’s or Icing is $7, and this was $4.99 for a whole pack. The scrunchies are all decent quality... a nice variety of colors that are displayed accurately in the product photos, good stitching, hidden seams and no holes or flaws in the seams that I can see. They all have varying degrees of tightness as another reviewer mentioned. This is fine... some can be worn to bed or for more relaxed, messy ponytails. Some are all business. Well, as “business” as a scrunchie can be.<br /><br />Anyway, the only reason that I rated these 3 stars and not 5 is because they included a sheet of paper, telling me to enjoy my complimentary gift in exchange for a high star rating. And then they regretfully forgot to include my bribe- I mean, my gift. This is kind of a shady way of doing business in my opinion, as I believe product reviews should be honest and accurate in describing the product and the details.<br /><br />Anyway, if you’re looking for cheap scrunchies, these are a great option. Maybe yours will come with a bonus gift? Maybe it won’t.\n",

Blow Dry Spray for Flat Iron - Infused with Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Keratin and Collagen for Thermal Protection and Hair Care - 8oz]]) but give the repair mask only 4 stars because it feels more like a high-quality conditioner than a “repair mask”. I didn’t notice a dramatic difference in my hair like after other masks or deep conditioners, just a nice softness to my hair from a high-quality conditioning product.<br /><br />The bottom-line: I’d recommend this for daily use or several times a week but more as a regular conditioner than a deep repair mask.<br /><br />*I received the hair mask for evaluation and review\n",

      "7546->No difference after three weeks of consistent use, and product won't dispense through pump. | 3 | 1 | ANOTHER UPDATE:<br /><br />My dermatologist told me that unless a Vitamin C serum contained the L-ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C, I was wasting my money and doing little to improve my skin.  I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I've been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I'm sure that's contributing to my skin's appearance too.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it's at a microscopic level.  I'm buying another bottle - mainly because there's got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don't see improvement in my skin, I'm asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I'm amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.<br /><br />I'm very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &#34;baseline&#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &#34;selfies&#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I'll continue to use this product until it's gone.<br /><br />I DO like that this retinol doesn't irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.<br /><br />In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won't dispense through the pump.  It's too thick.  I'm having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I'm surprised I haven't read about this problem in other reviews. Another reason I'm leery of all the glowing comments.<br /><br />I'll update with my progress, or lack thereof, at a later date.\n",
      "7551->Packaging is heart shaped; love the colors & sponge texture; metal holder is great | 4 | 1 | This is a lovely set of two sponges but they are not heart shaped. What is heart shaped is the plastic holding the two sponges together with the flat side joining into what almost looks like a heart. Nevertheless, I still love them. The set comes with a great metal sponge holder. The sponges are dense. As a result, make-up does not soak in as easily.<br /><br />Both blenders have a flat side which is great for smooth applications. These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this with the exception that the sponges are on the dense side instead of airy. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too - at least to me. These colors also make it perfect for the Easter Basket.<br /><br />At the current price of $7.99 this comes to a pricey $2.66 per piece if I count the holder. Most other blenders sell for between $1.25 and $1.75 per piece in a set like this but without the heart-shaped packaging.\n",

First of all, my jar is not “ whipped” anything ! Look at my photos and see that my jar is like spackling  putty , it was even hard to chip off a section to try it . It didn’t melt in my hand, it was more like trying to rub coconut oil into my skin in the winter. Lots of flaky pieces . And frankly, the smell is disturbing too. Now maybe something happened to this in storage or processing , but it’s going in the garbage. I honestly cannot use it . Kinda shocked !<br />PS their store page shows nothing but camera equipment ?

It’s more sheer and less oily.<br />Not much of flavor or scent which I’m fine with.<br />However, I am greatly disappointed with the fact that the stick DOES NOT stay up when you apply it. I roll out little bit to apply onto my lips. There’s little bit of pressure involved in order to apply of course, and the stick rolls down. By the end, the stick is complete rolled down. I am so frustrated with this functionality failure. It makes it hard to use frequently. I am returning it and getting the tub because I’ll have control.\n",

Oilier skin tends to age better. I have dry skin, but I have been moisturizing and protecting with SPF since my teens).<br /><br />MY skin: Mid 40s, very clear, very fair, minimal/no lines, supple, leans dry, has Rosacea (non-acne, just flushing and redness from visible veins). My skin loves hydration, oils, thicker heavier products.<br /><br />This product:<br />--stay fresh, pump style tube container (think of a toothpaste container with a pump)<br />-- thin, light, but rich lotion.<br />--smooth, glides on<br />--absorbs quickly, no lingering sheen or greasiness.<br />--plays well with other products (ie; toners, serums, SPF, make up)<br />--gentle, non irritating.<br />--skin nourishing ingredients<br />--no added fragrance; barely there naturally occurring scent.<br /><br />When I use it: daytime after serum (if I use one) but before SPF.<br /><br />Quite a range of experiences and preferences, but that make sense since we all have different skin and skin care needs. So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.<br /><br />I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don't want to fuss.<br /><br />Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.<br /><br />Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.<br /><br />I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars\n",

It's not cheap! My nailbeds got very swollen underneath and took about two weeks to heal after completely removing it. It's been almost a month now and my nails are still all pitted and super sensitive, the parts that got swollen are peeling away and it's really gross to look at. I wish I wasn't allergic, it's so pretty. I tried again thinking it was a specific color, the greenish one, or my failure to use a base coat, but it's happening again with both the pinkish and the gold. It feels like I slammed all 10 fingers in a car door, I can't even open a can of pop without using a tool to help me because of the pain. I haven't ever experienced this before. If I am affected by other polishes in the same way, I will update this review, to be fair.<br /><br />Update: Three years later and my fingernails are still deformed from the allergic reaction.\n",

Third round - still a faint stench, but could mostly just smell soap.<br /><br />I went through my day, and once in a while I'd get a whiff of stink. It took three days for the smell to go completely away.<br /><br />I now know why hippies and dirt heads smell so gawd awful, if this is the crap they use.<br /><br />On the pro side, it did not irritate my pits, just my sense of smell.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.

      "7710->Compact, Quiet and Works Well | 5 | 1 | I selected this little hair remover/shaver for my wife, to replace a trimmer she had simply worn out over time. This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators. After one use, my wife is very pleased with it.<br /><br />This trimmer is similar to a rotary shaver that men use to shave (except one head instead of three) and is similar in size to a glue stick. It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me – she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish. This is absolutely not the job for which this little trimmer was designed, but apparently it will work in a pinch.<br /><br />Compared to other trimmers she has used, this one is very gentle and when it’s turned on it doesn’t sound like it’s laboring like some of the others do.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little hair trimmer, designed for facial hair. It’s small, quiet and works well.\n",

The biggest letdown was the smell, it could have been so awesome if it was a juicy watermelon smell but it just smells slightly chemically sweet.

I mean this is kind of a waste of money. It's really cheap material. Literally the ears are made of one thin wire that shapes it and it's covered in cheap lace.<br />I could already tell right from out of the packaging that these pair of ears were cheap looking. They did not even make any effort of cutting the lace right. One ear has more lace material than the other and it's kind of bulging out. Plus the lace is already falling apart. There were a few pieces of lace that came off already and I literally just opened the packaging like 10 minutes ago. I had to re shape the ears just to make it look decent, like an actual pair of cat ears and not mouse ears. I really don't like giving bad reviews but this product was so bad that I had no choice and I wouldn't want other people wasting their money on this cheap product.\n",
      "7784->Holy Cow Badgers Are SOFT!!! | 4 | 1 | 100% badger hair, which I guess is a good thing, I've been told by men that that's a good thing. From what I understand, badger hair shaving brushes lasts a lot longer than other hair shaving brushes.<br /><br />I'm touching the brush right now and I had no idea that Badgers were this soft! Not that I want to touch one of the live, because they're a little scary looking to me.<br /><br />I like the fact that the handle of the square is flat, so it stands up straight. Or you can flip it upside down and it has the ridge in it to put into a holder.<br /><br />The handle is really nice, it's a really pretty white wood, and its move. There will be no splinters coming out of this handle. I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.\n",
      "7799->Organic Moringa 100% natural handmade soap is such an awesome product I love it | 5 | 1 | Organic Moringa 100% natural handmade soap is such an awesome product I love it. I always try to source out all natural wholesome products for my family and I am so glad I was able to find this one. Turmeric is one of my favorite supplements to use for my health and my skin. It is free from harsh detergents, sulfates, additives, artificial colors and perfumes.<br />I am very impressed with the high quality and care that is taken into making this excellent soap. My skin feels softer and smoother and my dry skin is so nourished and soft now. It was a very nice experience that left my skin feeling soft and smooth and smelling lovely.<br />This is a Excellent soap that is full of all healthy natural ingredients. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I am very pleased with my skin and how it feels from using this product as well. It is wrapped is a great wrapper that makes it unique and decorative.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "7806->No, No Nooooo! | 1 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:c90a143dced07dff7222aec252715475]] Im a hair stylist that own a hair salon...I have had my hands trough hair for over 20 years, and this is by far the worst hair I have ever purchased... I made 2 orders of the 360+Bundles. When I received the hair I opened the box and saw the plastic eye lash and the weaving cap, I was not impressed with that I wanted to see the product.  I took one bundle of hair out the plastic bag and said OH HELL NAW... I ten begin to take all the hair and 360's out of the bag and said OH HELL NAW, AND WENT TO MY COMPUTER TO REQUEST A REFUND TO SHIP BACK...<br /><br />See video, the hair on the yellow envelope is this hair review<br /><br />Pro's: NONE<br /><br />Con's:<br />There are way \"TOOO MANY FLY A-WAYS\" in each bundle. This is a big deal for me cause what if my client wanted to wear the hair flat ironed straight, it will look tacky with all the fly a-ways.<br /><br />2. There are red, gold, light brown strands that over taking the bundles and closure. This is a problem if my clients wanted to be in sunlight you will see all the different color strands in the hair.<br /><br />PLEASE TAKE NOTE: WHEN YOU BUY HAIR WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT COLOR STRANDS IN IT, THATS AN INDICATION THAT IT IS NOT REMY AND THE HAIR DID NOT COME FROM ONE PERSON HEAD, WHICH WILL CAUSE TANGLING, AND SHORT LIFE SPAN! BUT DONT BUY BUNDLES THAT IS BLACK BECAUSE THE COLORED THE HAIR TO COVER UP THE MANY DIFFERENT COLOR STRANDS...<br /><br />9A AND 10A GRADE BUNDLES SHOULD BE COLOR 1B NATURAL WITH NO ORTHER COLOR STANDS!\n",
      "7834->Still Using Them | 4 | 1 | I found this bargain from a dentist on Amazon. I didn't expect much. They are great. I like the fact that they have a small head. Being Oral B, you know you have a good product. I have TMJ, my mouth can not open very wide without pain. So these smaller brushes work well for me. They are not tiny, as for a child, just a little smaller that most brushes. A good feature also is, they have a stripe in the middle of the brush. This will diminish in color, as the brush needs to be replaced. So you don't have to think how long you have been using the s<br />ame brush. The brush tells you!  MAK, PA\n",
      "7839->Nice but! | 3 | 1 | I do like this,but, the sides are not exactly the same.  Meaning the one side is intertwined nicely but the other side does not match (one in twisted and it looks nice , the other side is not twisted) not equal.  I looked at how it was put together but I won't be able to disassemble it to make it equal.<br /><br />This was quickly assembled and NO quality control.  It's a shame because I really do like this necklace.\n",
      "7858->Some flaws, but it's cheap, good color match and does pretty much what I needed. | 3 | 1 | I got the dark brown 4\" short wavy style, as it looked the most like my own hair and I wanted something to cover up a bad haircut.<br /><br />It didn't look very good on the mannequin in the description, and looks about as bad, or maybe a little worse, on me.  As soon as I put it on I thought, \"Oh, hello, Peter Brady.\"  It definitely looks like a wig.<br /><br />It also has lots of little ragged bits at the top where tufts of short hair stick up like cowlicks (I think they're poking up from the seams underneath), which looks odd and not like it's part of the wig's hairstyle.<br /><br />If I needed this to cover my whole head, I would never choose it.  However, the color is a good match to my hair, and I discovered that if I wear it like a sort of \"beanie\" further back on my head (secured in place with bobby pins) and leave my own hair in the front so you can see the part, then it looks pretty natural.  And it was a good price.\n",
      "7865->Terrible--buy another brand! | 1 | 1 | Let me start by saying I have magnetic liner/lashes from another company, so I have experience wearing this sort of product.<br /><br />The biggest issue is that the adhesive used to keep these on the storage tray is SO STICKY you cannot get it off the actual lash band.  Further, the magnets are not along the band, but on the actual lashes. As such, the magnets don't actually come into contact with the magnetic eyeliner, making these utterly pointless.<br /><br />Magnetic lashes are AMAZING.  Just not these.\n",
      "7866->Great mascara that improves your eye lashes for length, sadly not for thickness | 4 | 1 | This is a pretty nice mascara. It comes in a very nice container that looks great. The wand is a very thin and long wand that makes it easy to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy. All in all this is a good one, great for length but no real improvement in regards to thickness.\n",
      "7909->It’s really really adorable in my hair however… | 3 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:f7a496b8573ef75cce856e43697157ad]] What I do like:<br />1. The color is vibrant.<br />2. It’s very cute and does give the oversized look when wearing it.<br /><br />What I don’t like and why I didn’t give 5 stars:<br />1. It gets “runs” easily. You can see from my picture there’s several “runs” like would happen to a set of tights. When you’re wearing it however they’re not obvious at all.<br />2. This might be a no brainer because of the size but this is not really a wrist scrunchie, it’s so large wrist wear isn’t practical. You’ll need to either commit to wearing this all day or have some bag or purse to keep it in, this is slightly less practical for daily use then I personally like.<br />3. It’s not tight enough to be used alone, you’ll need to first use a regular hair tie and then add this for decoration, I prefer scrunchies alone because hair ties hurt after a while but this scrunchie is too slick to stay by itself and would need to be folded over several times eliminating that cute chunky oversized look that this is supposed to give.<br /><br />Although I’m a little let down by the practical use potential of the product, I do like this and will definitely continue to use it for special occasions just not daily wear.\n",

      "7925->where is the heat? | 1 | 1 | It is just luke warm on high setting.<br />I really regret buying this one.<br />Bristles are longer than others, and that's about it.<br />I feel my money went down the drain buying this brush iron.\n",
      "7932->ok eyelashes | 2 | 1 | these are ok eyelashes, they are very soft which is a plus<br /><br />however, they are definitely NOT ellipse/flat. And theyre all different widths and lengths even though I bought the 8mm pack, which makes them hard to use\n",
      "7941->No different than a regular brush... dont buy | 1 | 1 | Works no different than a regular brush...<br />Didnt go through any tangles any easier<br />Didnt go through my curly hair any easier...<br />Bristles actually hurt\n",
      "7946->Soft for a pumice stone. | 3 | 1 | These are just \"ok\" for a pumice stone & in my personal experience they didn't really work for me as I found them to be entirely too \"soft\" as I have tough skin with callouses. They came in a 4 pack & are approximately 2\"x4\" with a rough or gritty soft side that easily dents & left a gritty residue on my skin & then there's a harder softer side that left a weird powder behind both of which I was able to wash off. In my experience pumice stones are usually much harder & don't disintegrate as quickly as these did. I typically soak my feet for a bit then air dry them right before using the pumice stone & when done I wash my feet but with these I even tried not soaking my feet & using them before washing & neither way got me any significant results.<br /><br />Overall this is an \"ok\" product but my experience left me thinking they may not  be for everyone especially those with thick skin & callouses. I will update if things change. Please see pics with my review for reference. I did receive this product for free but that has in no way influenced my review.

      "7953->I wanted to like these soooo much…but nope, sorry | 1 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:dcc1995803f2ea0bca73889e0d891af]] I got the ikikin Soft Silicone Bath brush for two reasons:  1) replace my exfoliating face scrub and 2) replace my body wash pouff.  It sadly didn’t work for either purpose.<br /><br />There are two sides on the brush:  one has little silicone fingers for regular exfoliation, and the other has…well, I don’t know what to call it.  The manufacturer says it has “short” bristles but it doesn’t.  They claim you can use it for deep exfoliation but I don’t see how.  It doesn’t have any holes on that side so the inside sponge can’t get any soap on to that side.  So it just kind of rubbed my skin raw because of the dryness…and not in a good way.<br /><br />As for the side with the little silicone fingers…that does, indeed, have some holes to let the sponge inside squeeze the soap foam out.  But I had to really squeeze the brush several times to get anything out onto the surface of the brush…and then had to keep stopping and squeezing some more.  I also didn’t like the texture of the fingers.  It’s more of a rubbing feeling than an exfoliating feeling.  Way too rough on my face (and I use apricot scrub normally so I’m used to a lot of exfoliation).  And not flexible enough to go around the curves on the rest of my body.<br /><br />As for the sponge inside…putting body wash on the outside as recommended means you waste a lot of body wash because it will run right off the silicone.  I squeezed my body wash onto the sponge itself on the inside, and that worked better…but as I mentioned before it still took a lot of squeezing after that to get the foam back out on the outside.  I also had hoped that I could put my little leftover slivers of bar soap in there and use those up…but squeezing the brush to get the foam started just broke up the slivers and didn’t do much else.<br /><br />So no for me.\n",

      "7967->eh. | 1 | 1 | Update- the replacement quit working today. Two times I used it and it quit- don’t waste your money on this…<br /><br />The first time I received this item, I got 1/2 way finished with my hair before it errored out on me and completely quit working. I had a replacement sent to me and so far, I've not had any issues with this one burning out. I've used it once and its super simple and easy to use. Unfortunately, I don't like the curls it gives me- It curls all the way down to the ends and I'm just not fond of how it looks. I think it would probably be good for a child's hair but not mine.\n",

      "8002->Overpriced and doesn't deliver enough value. | 2 | 1 | I was overall very disappointed with this shaver.  One would think that the top-of-the-line series from Norelco would be a great choice.  My experience was far from that.<br /><br />First, the shaver does not deliver good shaving coverage on the neck and overall shaving was slow.  I have a 9 year old Norelco that covers my neck better, and delivers a faster shave.  This is despite only having one set of blades per head and not being able to pivot.<br /><br />Second, the chrome plating on the display of the shaver began to peel off.  Although it looked nice when new, I would not expect a product of this quality to have a visual defect such as that.<br /><br />Third, there is very little storage for hairs.  The shaver needs to be emptied by folding back each of the blade heads individually.  This wasn't a huge deal, but I'd rather have a razor that can handle a few shaves worth of hairs.<br /><br />On the positive side, the charging stand and the travel case are very nice, the best I've ever seen.  However, if you want a rotary shaver, I'd choose a less expensive rotary model.  I replaced this unit with a Braun 590CC and am thrilled with the performance of that shaver vs. the Norelco thus far.\n",

      "8021->Happy with it, | 4 | 1 | It is exactly like the picture. I like it . However it was shipped in an envelope  (not protected enough) so the middle stone came off. I can and will reattach it with glue. It looks like a good amount of glue was used to attach the jewels. It’s a good price .<br />Up date I reattached the jewel with good glue and all’s good!\n",
      "8026->Takes the pain away. | 5 | 1 | Use it for minor pain. Caught my foot under a car seat about 8 years ago. Twisted foot, leg, etc..<br />Still in pain daily. This cream relieves it for a long while. Pain relief is almost instantaneous.\n",
      "8028->Creamy and Moisturizing | 4 | 1 | I've read a lot of good reviews about Mitchell's Wool Fat Soap, so I had to at least give it a try. It is definitely worth the money. It is a very rich, thick lather that carries a bunch of moisture to your face which makes for a nice shave,<br /><br />I also bought the wood Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl and the Mitchell's fits in it perfectly.\n",
      "8041->LOVE IT! | 4 | 1 | This is a nice head form for hats, wigs, etc. I would have given it 5 stars but when you pick it up by the head, it comes out of the plastic piece that holds it. No biggie though!<br /><br />Will probably order again.\n",
      "8049->Good sponge, so-so cleanser | 3 | 1 | I like the sponge that comes with it. It comes wrapped in plastic and feels very hard, like a pumice stone. Once you soak it in water though, it becomes very soft and malleable. The sponge alone is a 5/5.<br /><br />The cleanser on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine. It does not have an inner seal and the smell is just meh. I don't know how another reviewer got a citrus smell since the ingredients don't include fragrance. I think the cleanser is a little too harsh and drying for my skin, it might be better for people with very oily skin.\n",
      "8056->Didn't seem to help my acne | 4 | 1 | This cleanser didn't seem to help my acne (and I used the entire bottle over time), but that may just be because I have persistent hormonal acne. It also made my skin feel \"squeaky\", which is usually a sign that the cleanser is stripping too much of the natural oils & sebum off of your skin.<br /><br />Overall, not my favorite cleanser.\n",
      "8070->Yes, size matters. | 2 | 1 | I have two pairs of glasses that lost a screw each.  Years ago if I lost a screw I'd go to the local drugstore and buy one of the little combo screwdriver, magnifying glass, that came with about a 1/2 doze screws. I don't ever remember those screws not fitting whatever glasses/sunglasses I tried to fix.<br /><br />I looked at a lot of kits that had dozens or hundreds of screws of varying sizes. I read through reviews and even with the huge selections and &#34;variety&#34; of screws there was a surprising number of people who complained that none of the screws fit their glasses.  I decided to steer clear of those and settled on this kit because of the variety of other items included.<br /><br /> However, after pulling out my magnifying glass I tried each screw size one by one and none fit.  Two were too large and one was too small.<br /><br />Since the smallest went through the hole I decided to try using one of the nuts that came with the kit. First, I couldn't tell what fit with what because there is no guide. Second, after trying the nuts on the smallest screw I found they didn't fit.<br /><br />I finally just stripped a piece of copper wire from some speaker wire I have laying around and threaded it through the hole in the glasses and tightened it down.  So, at least I have something that will hold until my eye appointment and I don't have to worry about the lens popping out.<br /><br />I'm keeping the kit.  I'll probably just pick up a few screws from the optomitrist once he lets me know what size I need and replace the ones that are in the kit so it's not  a complete loss. I'm not sure when, or if I'll need the other items that come in the kit.  Also, there are things that came with it that I have no idea what they are for. One of those are some very tiny plastic cones.  I'm sure they have a purpose...\n",

      "8081->Shaves great without pinching or pulling | 4 | 1 | What I liked:<br />-The razor is so quiet I thought the batteries were almost dead<br />-It shaves great/close without pinching<br />-The batteries seem to last a long time. When the razor started slowing down, I charged them (red light never came on telling me to charge them) but the charge worked fine<br />-I've been using the razor daily for weeks and I would most definitely purchase another one at this price<br />What surprised me:<br />-The razor is small and the shaving area is smaller than my other razors but it cuts great while hardly making any sound at all<br /><br />OVERALL: Great razor for the price. I'm not sure if the batteries are replaceable (I'm guessing NO) but I do like the razor a lot.\n",
      "8083->Love this stuff but super pricey | 3 | 1 | I felt like I had to post since it had 1 star and said it was musty. I loved the smell and thought it was light and fresh. I also loved knowing it more natural than other leave in conditioners. I would but it if it were lower in price. There are sample sizes for $6 on the wash with water website if you want to try for yourself before buying. I even gave the sample sizes out at a mommy Meetup<br /> &#34;give what you love&#34; Christmas party since limit was $5 since I liked it so much. However I did find a cheaper lavender one on Amazon I use since I didn't want to pay $30 for leave in conditioner.\n",

      "8118->Sampler set is a great way to try English Laundry. | 5 | 1 | There are four bottles included in this nicely packaged set. The set comes in a dark brown \"textured\" heavy cardboard box, wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve. I mention the specifics of the packaging, because the pretty packaging makes it gift-ready. (Just add a bow or a ribbon, a name tag, and you're done!)<br /><br />Despite the fact that I'm calling this a \"sampler set\" the 20 ml bottles are good size. (Not tiny little things.) There's plenty of product to use each fragrance for awhile. (You can really get to know the aromas this way. It's not a one-and-done type of sampler.)<br /><br />All four fragrances are pleasant, clean, and crisp. My partner likes Oxford Bleu and Riviera the most. He says these have a \"fresh\" smell to him. (I agree!. The Oxford Bleu is my favorite.)<br /><br />If you're not familiar with English Laundry scents, this set is a great way to try several of their offerings. If you already love English Laundry, here's a chance to enjoy some of your favorites.\n",
      "8123->Mine Heats Way Too High on Low | 3 | 1 | The space-saving feature of this foot spa is its main benefit.  And it’s a great feature:  it stores in half the space of a regular foot spa.<br /><br />The foot spa feels solid when it’s expanded.  It compresses again after use pretty easily.<br /><br />There is a remote control that allows you to choose:<br /><br />1.  Heat + bubbles<br />2.  Heat<br />3.  Low, medium or high for the heat<br />4.  Power on or off<br /><br />What is missing is bubbles only.  I could not find a way to use the bubbles without heat.  If low heat had been comfortable, then perhaps that would be a compromise.  But after about 10 minutes low heat was so hot I had to remove my feet because it was becoming very painful.  I cannot imagine what medium or high would do.  I do not know if the unit I received has a defective thermostat.  If not, then you won’t like heated water unless you’re after the boiled lobster effect for your feet.<br /><br />Inasmuch as I can’t opt for bubbles without the heat, the only benefit to this foot spa for me would be the rollers across the bottom (they feel pretty darned good) and the space saving aspect (as compared to my non-electric basic foot tub).\n",
      "8149->PU case really smells; brushes are okay; two brush heads frayed | 3 | 1 | There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eye blending (fan brush), etc. In fact, there are more brushes than I needed. <br /><br />The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for; it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. \n",

      "8211->Beautiful clip but has loose applique that causes it to rattle | 4 | 1 | This clip is gorgeous. If one looks at it quickly, it can easily be mistaken for a tarantula due to the black claws and sort of fuzzy looking applique.<br /><br />I have short to medium fine curly hair and my hair is long enough in the back to use this clip. It holds on to my hair well and looks great. The only negative is that a couple of the beads are loose on the applique. This not only makes noise (i.e. rattles) but creates a situation where they can accidentally be pulled off if the \"plastic\" thread holding it loosely hooks onto something.<br /><br />The current price of $11.99 is pricey for this but typical for a $1.50 clip that is all dressed up.\n",
      "8215->It's a great toothbrush! A little $$$ though... | 4 | 1 | Great sonic toothbrush, however, due to the cost, I cannot give it 5 stars.<br />Pros: This Panasonic toothbrush works excellent. Just as good as my previous Sonicare. It leaves my teeth feeling so clean and helps keep my gums healthy. The battery life is amazing, I have gone up to 5 days without charging. Several brushing modes. Great build quality.<br />Cons: Price, a equally good Sonicare costs about 1/2 of this Panasonic. Another issue are the brush heads. They also cost more than Sonicare heads and are not as common..<br /><br />I think this is a great toothbrush, however I think the price should be lowered as the extra &#34;features&#34; are really unnecessary.\n",
      "8223->Didn't Work for Me! | 2 | 1 | I have hair about as kinky as possible and this product did give me lots of kinky, spiral curls. For that, I give it two stars. I won't give more stars because #1. The smell. It smells like a cheap men's cologne and it never dissipates! I could smell it while I was trying to go to sleep last night. I was tempted to get up in the middle of the night and wash my hair to get rid of that smell. If you touch your hair, it lingers on your fingers. I found myself hesitant to pet my cat because I didn't want to transfer whatever is in this stuff  to her fur then she licks it off, digesting it. #2. My hair looked decent (not nice but decent) while it was damp but as it dried, I looked like a fool. #3. The day after. I woke up to a mess. My hair was dry, hard, brittle and kinkier than normal.<br /><br />I will be returning this for a refund and exploring other curling products.\n",
      "8232->Incredible set of stunning lipsticks! | 5 | 1 | I just love these Sigma Lipsticks! In this set you get 4 unique lipsticks that are all in the same color family but the colors are different enough that you actually get 4 different lipsticks and it is worth getting this set for a whopping $75! The colors are 2 beautiful earthy nudes, one more pinky nude and one stunning red tone that is just plain perfect! This is a gorgeous set in regards to colors.<br /><br />Now the applicators are so unique and different and stunning on their own. They also have a magnetic closure of sorts because when you close them they kind of pull shut at the very end so they must have a magnetic closure in it.<br /><br />The lipstick themselves are super creamy and feel amazing on the lips. They have a pleasant taste to them and are just amazing. There is nothing but greatness about them and these are worthy of the name Sigma! I love everything about these and can only recommend this set. Perfect to give as a gift or purchase and breakup and give individual ones as a gift since each are packaged in a box.\n",
      "8253->Got Soap? | 5 | 1 | Just like soap.Oh my it is soap.<br />It will slippie and slidie over every body's hidie<br />Just relax and let the suds do their work<br /> After using this soap to bathe I looked 10 days younger!!!\n",
      "8259->Lovely cream.  Pricey. | 4 | 1 | I am not pregnant,  just a thirty-something gal who wanted a natural cream for dry crepe skin.  I live in a hot, dry climate and this has worked beautifully on sensitive skin areas (inner thighs,<br />under arms) that have not been reacting to normal moisturizers.  It's silky smooth when applied and the scent is very light (I'm  SUPER sensitive to smells and I can stand it. Hope they never add any more smell! ).  I also like that it has the added benefit of helping prevent stretch marks,  which I had started to get due to slight weight fluctuations.  I took one star away for price($25 at this time) .  VERY pricey for an everyday use cream to the point where I would be hesitant to get it regularly.\n",
      "8264->Fun alternative to microblading | 4 | 1 | Its a pretty cool item. It arrived as described, but I guess I was expecting it to be a bit bigger...it's pretty small.<br />I tried it on my hand before attempting it on my face, and it did exactly as described. Heres the thing though: As one who is fortunate to have some eyebrow already, you MUST comb your brows in the direction you want to use the pen before you apply. Drawing against hairs is self defeating.  Also, you must do a little practice on how the lines will go. It isn't mascara, or shadow, or even liner. It takes a bit of practice to get it right. Watch microblading videos...yeah...it's pretty much that, without the pain or permanence...and just as easy to screw up and look awful.  (look up &#34;bad microblade&#34; and you'll see what I mean) Not something I plan to use every day, but a wonderful alternative to the permanence and &#34;blue fade&#34; of microblading. Also, I mascara my brows after I use the pen to soften the lines a bit. Have fun! It's definitely a fun product to play with.\n",
      "8270->Not good quality | 3 | 1 | Some came already like chipped & arent quite sturdy.. i prob didnt grab the correct size some fit too small others a lil big.<br />I wouldn't buy it again.\n",
      "8276->If you sleep alone | 1 | 1 | The marketing blurb says, among other things \"this advanced man face care formula features stem cells to help revive the skin and smooth out imperfections\".<br />Well... stem cells, if they were actually somehow harvested, in a cosmetics container, mixed with various other chemicals and ingredients would necessarily be dead and therefore completely irrelevant. And, of course, the stem cells would help address things such as diabetes and repair of heart muscle following heart attack, not zits on one's face. Not to mention that they would need to be live and 'human' cells. So, I am quite confident that the 'stem cells' claim is untrue and, even if it were true, the presence of dead stem cells in a cream would make zero difference.<br />Other than that, the cream is thick and, as other reviewer found, it has an aggressive smell that reminded me of Noxzema. So I would never use it during the day. At night, it would probably be Okay if used by men who sleep alone.\n",
      "8281->Smells off and doesn't go on nicely | 1 | 1 | It smells like it's gone bad, not fresh and clean. The creme is rather dry in top, like a crust, but below the crust it is merely thick and off smelling. I tried it anyway and will not use it again. It did not go smoothly over my skin and even after generally massaging there were bits and tiny clumps of the creme left behind.<br />I will not be buying this product again.\n",
      "8294->Don’t waste your time or money. | 2 | 1 | It’s been roughly 2 weeks since I dyed my hair and the color is already super faded and patchy. The whole process to bleach, dye and final wash took me almost 4 hours, two boxes of product, one towel and now a blue bathroom sink. My hair did not get fully “hay blonde” that Splat suggests and that’s after using 2 bottles of bleach. I used 2 dark blue dye bottles and only one of the teal.<br />I waited over 48 hours before I did the first real wash and then have washed my hair every third day to try to preserve the color as long as possible and I can literally see it fading hard every shower and that’s using color safe products. I’m at the 2 week mark and my hair is now green and patchy with bleached hair showing through. I followed the box directions precisely and did everything I was supposed to. I even contacted Splat to get further tips and tricks on making it last and still it sucks. I understand this is an at home kit and I wasn’t really expecting too much from it considering all the reviews I read before hand but I expected more than this. Even the glove are too short in my opinion. They barely go to the beginning of my wrist which meant the dye was able to find its way under the gloves. This dye does truly dye anything it touches so cover literally everything before hand to prevent accidents. I was able to remove it from my skin using some baby oil and a towel so that’s easy but my sink is now blue.<br />There are further instructions that they should have stated on the box so beginners can get the most out of the box. Like wrapping your hair with a plastic bag or towel during the bleach process to hold on the heat and help with lifting color.<br />I fully understood what I was writing into when I purchased this. I read everything I could and watched every video I could find so I’m not judging this product on that factor. I gave it two stars because it took way too long and there’s too much maintenance to do to it to really equal out the lasting ability. I have to blow dry it every time I leave the shower or get it wet at all, meaning sweating or if it rains, because it will bleed hard.<br />I don’t recommend this if you’re looking for something even semi permanent because it’s not. I’d say if you’re looking for something for a couple weeks to go crazy or for a Halloween project but nothing more.\n",
      "8300->Lovely palette, poorly named. | 4 | 1 | I really like this palette, but feel it should be noted that it is NOT as expected. Very nice colors, but more subdued than bold, more satin/shimmer than metallic.  This is my first Ulta palette and I am happy with the quality.  I only deducted one star because the colors are somewhat other than expected.  I paid $12.<br /><br />I specifically bought it for the green color, and I still like the green color, but it's not as bright or as metallic as the collection name caused me to expect.  The finish is something of a shimmering satin, not metallic.  The colors are somewhat subdued.  The package says &#34;jewel tones&#34; which may be more accurate than the &#34;metals&#34; description, but still (to me) implies more brightly colored shades, with fewer earth tones.  I would also expect a &#34;jewel toned&#34; palette to include a strong purple, and this only has the lilac (Dynasty). (The Royal looks purple but swatched brown with a hint of burgundy.) The colors are more woodsy than jeweled.  The green is more mossy than emerald, the purple more floral than jeweled, the blue more night sky than sapphire.<br /><br />The quality of the shadows is good.  Neither buttery nor powdery, it's a slightly dry formula that nevertheless doesn't kick up a lot of product or cause a lot of fall out.  I wear them over a primer, but I have been happy with their wear time.  As stated above, pigmentation is good in that you don't have to build heavily, but it's also not a bright coloring.<br /><br />A lovely bonus is that I actually love the brush that comes with this item!  How often do you say that about a brush in a palette?  It's not only soft and usable, it's unique among my brush collection.  It's flufflier and less flat that most brushes of it's size, and it's also smaller and more pinpointed that most brushes that have a bit of fluffiness to them.  Overall, I feel like it gives good control while still blending well.  It's quickly become a favorite brush.<br /><br />There may have been a naming crisis when creating this palette, lol.  As the palette name is Metals, the subtitle is Jewels, and every individual shade is named with a royalty/gentry theme.  The shares are: Noble (white), Lady (pale pink), Reign (earthy pink), Crown (gold), Dynasty (lilac), Royal (brown), Honor (platinum), Jester (silver), Armor (bronze),  Fortress (green), Duchess (navy), and Duke (off black).  No mattes, all satin/shimmer.  All smooth, no fall out, some apply more evenly than others (drier formula).  Swatched dry on dry skin in photo.  Will build to brighter, more shiny finish.<br /><br />I ordered this palette on a whim, and I've enjoyed it.  However, if you are wanted super metallic finishes or bright colors, you should manage your expectations.\n",
      "8304->Epilator:  Fantastic.  \"Spa\" brush: Meh. | 4 | 1 | Pros:  Nifty brush attachment<br />  Silk Epil 7 is a great epilator even without accessories<br />  Brush attachment feels fantastic on tired feet<br />  If you are prone to ingrown hairs, this might help exfoliate to keep them at bay.  YMMV.<br />  Silk Epil 7 has a light to show you what you missed. Apparently, with my non-lit epilator, I was missing so much that I'm a bit embarrassed.<br />  Cordless (once charged) for your hair removal wanderlust.<br />  Massaging rollers on the epilator head really do make it less uncomfortable (they seem to distract nerves just a little)<br />  My hair grows in much finer and lighter in color. YMMV.<br /><br />Cons: Brush is only for the body NOT FOR USE ON THE FACE!<br />  Brush is not friendly to my sensitive skin<br />  Brush pops off too easily during use<br /><br />My advice:  If you don't have a Clarisonic brush (with the body brush head), you might like a motorized shower brush.  If you really don't care about the brush, you might want to take a look at the other Silk Epil 7 packages out there.  Some of them have more or less accessories, and different price points that may be more or less appealing than this Spa package, some have facial hair attachments and some have an electric razor head/accessory.  It's up to you.  I do recommend the Silk Epil 7 though, but Braun offers enough of a variety of packages that include the Silk Epil 7 that you can get exactly what you need.<br /><br />Lengthier review:<br /><br />The \"Spa\" Attachment:<br />This is not my first epilator.  In fact, this is my second Braun Silk Epil 7 Epilator.  My previous one was not part of a \"SPA\" package.<br /><br />I adore the Silk Epil 7.  I used this model before I got the Spa set:  [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet & Dry Epilator 1 Count]]<br /><br />I still love the epilator portion and think that the little \"headlight\" and the bumpy rollers make things more efficient and less uncomfortable (uncomfortable if you have previously epilated or painful if you are a newbie to mechanically ripping the hair out of your legs).  The Silk Epil 7 handle is comfortable to hold, it is wet/dry, though I do not like wet epilation (it just doesn't do as thorough a job, for me as doing it dry).  I have tried other models from Braun and this one: [[ASIN:B004KMIZK6 Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator]] and at first I thought the Emjoi was the cat's pajamas, but the Silk Epil 7 (and even the 5) is far superior in regards to features, discomfort, and efficiency.  I have not even looked at the Emjoi since making the move to the Braun hair rippers.<br /><br />About the brush/spa attachment:<br />The \"sonic\" brush head dresses up the body of the Silk Epil 7 so it sort of looks like one of those Clarisonic type brushes.  At first I was excited that this would replace my Clarisonic and be a space saving and effort saving 2-in-1 extravaganza.  Such is not the case.  The brush head/attachment for the Silk Epil 7 is strictly for body only and NOT FOR THE FACE.  The brush head is good for regular body brushing/exfoliating to help prevent ingrown hairs (something I have never had a problem with since I started using an epilator, but many people do have that problem and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure).  I wanted to use it all over, not just where I used the epilator, and it feels fairly strong and abrasive compared to the more gentle (and quiet!) sounds of my Clarisonic with body brush head.  I came out of the shower and was bright pink.  My sensitive skin does ok with the Clarisonic, and fine with an exfoliating washcloth but the Silk Epil brush left me bright pink and feeling like I spent the day at the beach.  It did, though, make my feet look quite smooth and the sonic vibration and brush were strong enough that my tired feet did feel pampered, though my legs looked about the same.  Perhaps other users find the brush more helpful if they use their Silk Epil 7 in the shower.  I prefer to epilate dry skin/dry hair, so the only reason I would take it in the shower is to exfoliate the rest of my body, rather than as an adjunct to exfoliation.  The brush assembly/attachment was not that friendly as far as being able to angle the whole device to exfoliate my back and the head kept popping off, which was rather annoying and made me think that it is meant more for just the legs (and if just for the legs it seems almost excessive, but some may benefit from the sonic brushing to prevent ingrown hairs- potentially...).\n",
      "8315->Unreadable Instructions | 2 | 1 | I just unpacked it.  Like another reviewer, my box wasn’t sealed and the main unit was greasy to the touch.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the instructions, poorly translated from the original Chinese.  The result is hard-to-understand broken English, as in, “Gently hair repair is the cutter head in at the temples.”  There isn’t even a mention of beards.  I went to the manufacturer’s website hoping to get more information, but the product isn’t listed!<br /><br />Perhaps this works for men who already have experience with similar products, but as a first time beard wearer, I’m not too keen on a figure-it-out-as-I-go, trial-and-error approach to my face.\n",
      "8320->Super Soft Tootsies | 5 | 1 | Used on it's own or as an ingredient in a DIY skin preparation, rosehip seed oil is a multi-use mini-miracle.<br /><br />It can be used on the skin or hair, it even works wonders on dry, ragged cuticles.<br />Rough cracked heels and/or scaly feet? I took equal parts of this oil and emu oil, and rubbed it on my feet after dry buffing. Socks go on, and like me, you will wake up to soft, silky feet.<br /><br />Any oil can go rancid, so keep it in the fridge.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality of this rosehip seed oil I was given to test.\n",
      "8341->Great eye pillow for relaxation, headaches and puffy eyes! | 4 | 1 | I've been looking for something just like this, so when I was given the opportunity to review it, at a discounted cost, I jumped at it.<br /><br />First off, I wouldn't really consider this an eye mask for sleeping. It's great to place over your eyes or forehead for relaxing, headaches, itchy/watery/puffy eyes but without a strap to keep it on your face, I wouldn't sleep with it on.<br /><br />When I first took it out of the package, I was met with a powerful smell of lavender, so I knew that this definitely had enough potency to last for a while.<br /><br />Heat: After it was heated, the smell was initially little overpowering but after a while, it faded. It says to lightly spritz the mask and then heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave, which I did, but since it didn't feel hot enough, I put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and, for me, that was the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Cold: I tried freezing it to use on my eyes, since my allergies have been killing me this season and my eyes have been quite puffy and itchy, and I must say that I was rather pleased. It was cool, but definitely not too cold to place directly on my skin/eyes to soothe them. This time around, I could barely smell the lavender.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product but I wish the company had also enclosed a nice bag to seal the eye mask in when you're done using it. In the directions, it says to keep it in a sealed bag to help keep the lavender smell last longer so I had assumed that they would have included one with it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but it does not change my opinion of the product.\n",
      "8342->Smells refreshing | 4 | 1 | I don't shower everyday. I end up using a washcloth or wipe on the days that I don't shower. I have tried many different brands of wipes.<br /><br />I received 3 packs of 12 Revive body wipes. Each package is resealable. They are bigger than a baby wipe and smaller and thinner than other full body wipes that I've tried. They aren't so thin that they rip. The best part is the smell. So refreshing. It doesn't last for my entire body. If I'm just hitting key spots on my body, it works great. (Note, I did not try it in the microwave.)\n",
      "8351->Frankincense great product awesome seller | 5 | 1 | Will help moisturize dry curly hair<br />Excellent for face only face oil you will ever need.<br />So good for breathing this Frankincense.\n",
      "8362->Don’t Buy... Not Good Quality | 1 | 1 | Jars were broken.<br />Acrylic kept getting stuck in brushes. The color of the brushes came off in monomer. 🥴 I wouldn’t buy again.\n",
      "8366->Lengthens lashes well but does not use natural ingredients | 4 | 1 | All I can say is, “Wow!” This mascara definitely lengthens my lashes. This photo I took shows my eye on the left side with my old mascara on it, and the eye of the right has the Curl Addict mascara. What a huge difference!<br /><br />I have bought black-brown mascara in the past, but I like the look of this carbon black. The brush is different than I’ve used in the past- it has three parts that “bubble” out compared to just one brush that goes straight across. Works just as well as the straight across brush that i’m used to.<br /><br />I was looking for more natural/organic ingredients in my make up, and although this brand doesn’t go along with that philosophy, I do like how this mascara makes a big impact in my overall make up look. It was also packaged really cute and made up feel like I was receiving a gift in the mail. I am very happy with this purchase!\n",
      "8368->Thin formula but still my favorite! | 4 | 1 | Definitely my favorite top and base coat! It's incredibly solid and durable once fully cured. The only issue is the formula is a tad thin and the brushes hold A LOT of the polish. It takes some practice to not put too much on your nail, which affects how long your manicure lasts. I still recommend it over any other gel top and base coat.<br /><br />Also, when I received the package, some of the product had spilled out onto the bottles. It wasn't much but it smelled HORRIBLE. It was almost 100 degrees out when it was delivered and nail polish doesn't react well with heat so I don't really blame anyone for that. I wiped the bottles off with isopropyl alcohol and let them sit for a day or so to let the smell come off. Good as new!\n",
      "8392->Not my favorite. | 2 | 1 | Long before \"dermaplaning\" became a popular beauty trend, many women all over the world were using versions of razors like this to clear away their peach fuzz. It gives your makeup a smoother surface to settle on, makes your skin feel nice and soft, etc. I've been buying women's eyebrow razors for this purpose for ages, and those always worked fine, but I wanted to try these because they're bigger and would cover more surface area at once. It turns out that's a blessing AND a curse, as these are a little unwieldy and can be hard to use in spots like the upper lip, chin, and jawline.<br /><br />Also, these are really easy to cut yourself with, so be careful! The guard on them is basically non-existent. Not only is the blade itself sharp, but so is the handle. The handle is a pretty sharply-cut material that isn't comfortable to hold at all.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I don't recommend these. You can get better razors for cheaper prices out there.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please click the \"Yes/Helpful\" button below to let me know.

      "8397->Inefficient Razor that's Rough to Use: There are much better value bargain razors out there. | 2 | 1 | The Acevivi Razor : A Test and Review<br />I only came across this razor very recently. It intrigued me because some seemed to like it and report that it was well made. Also, like the new Fendrihan razors, it has an unusual head: Closed comb on one side; open comb on the other. I think the idea is that it offers two levels of aggression. The Lutz slant offers a similar choice of two levels of aggression.<br /><br />In use I found that both sides offered about the same level of aggression. Another reason for the test is that it's a low cost razor; under $13 currently on Amazon. I'm always intrigued by potential bargains!<br /><br />A further unusual feature is the exceptionally long handle. Longer than the Futur, longer than my Mergress, Schick Krona, or even my long handled Gillette Starburst, (aimed at the ladies” market); longer in fact than any razor I own. To some this is a plus, to others not so. It may be useful if ladies wish to use the razor on their legs, or other parts. The razor is well balanced so the long handle presented no problem.<br /><br />The razor comes with a box of five blades. I have no idea of their origin. But since the razor is Chinese, I expect China.<br /><br />The Blade used for the Test<br />I chose to use the Rapira Platinum Lux. I've found this blade to be consistent and reliable in just about every razor (but there are some razors where it's an indifferent pairing, say with my RR Wunderbar), and it's always good for at least four shaves, often six, in just about any razor. It's sharp, smooth, comfortable, very cheap to buy, and easily available, and my personal favorite of the Rapira line. I've also used it every DE razor I own at one time or another, and I own over 50 DE safety razors . Not my favorite blade, but a very good one in most razors. I used a brand new blade<br /><br />How I Used this Razor for the Test<br />When using an adjustable razor, (and following advice from others on this forum, including Jim Chandler, plus my own long experimentation) I've found the best way, for the smoothest and most comfortable shave is to INCREASE the aggression with each pass. It seems counter-intuitive at first but it really works best. It's like lowering the blade on a lawn mower to get a closer cut. I increased the aggression on each pass on this test.<br /><br />Since this razor supposedly offered two choices of aggression I used the Acevivi in this way: Less aggressive WTG and XTG, then more aggressive ATG and for buffing. I'm assuming that closed comb is less aggressive, though as some have reported with the Fendrihan, this is not always the case.<br /><br />Now in previous reviews, I notice that some people seem to miss this point. I really believe that this is the best way to get a very smooth, comfortable, and importantly irritation-free shave with an adjustable razor. I have a complete thread on this method. Please review the thread and give it a whirl, and report what you find please!<br /><br />The Routine<br />For testing I go through the same routine. I clean my face and wet the beard by washing with a glycerin soap. I rinse off the soap, wet it thoroughly and apply two drops of a pre-shave oil.<br /><br />By the way, I believe good pre-shave prep not only produces a better shave, but reduces irritation, and keeps you skin in good condition. I know of one rather famous reviewer whose skin frankly looks irritated, red, blotchy and awful, especially on his neck. I don't doubt he gets close shaves, but at what cost?<br /><br />I use an Arko shave stick applied directly to the beard and lather with a Stirling Synthetic “Kong” brush. I rinse and lather again between passes. I thoroughly rinse the head of the razor between passes.<br /><br />I remove the blade from the razor when I'm done. I dry it with a microfiber cloth. Naturally I dry the razor too when I'm done.<br /><br />I finish with an Alum block, which is a good indicator of razor burn or irritation. Then after washing it off , I apply Thayer's Alcohol Free Witch Hazel.<br /><br />The Shave<br />I shaved 22 hours before doing a test comparison of the Parker Variant and Ming Shi 2000s, so my face had a little less than average growth.<br /><br />First Pass WTG: Closed Comb Side<br />Fairly smooth, reasonably efficient. Not good enough for a one pass shave.<br /><br />Second Pass XTG: Closed Com Side<br />Not especially smooth and after the pass I wasn't especially happy with the hair removal. It still felt like there was a lot of hair, but I press on! Still not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />Third Pass ATG: Open Comb Side<br />Quite scratchy. I could feel the blade and I didn't enjoy the pass much. A lost of hair remained. Quite disappointing. Not a good shave at all.<br /><br />Buff up and J-hooking<br />I would have had to spend an age buffing and cleaning up because the beard was still quite rough, and frankly my face already felt quite irritated. So I did not buff with the Acevivi. There are limits to my testing zeal!<br /><br />Finishing the Shave:<br />Sometimes a specific blade is no good. In the interests of fairness, I took the blade out and put it in my most efficient razor, the RR Wunderbar slant (which incidentally is not a blade this razor likes a lot) and had to shave again, because the shave with the Acevivi was just not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />I then did another ATG pass, and boy, was there a lot to remove! The jawline and neck still had a lot of growth. The blade performed well in the Wunderbar, so I don't think one can't blame the blade.<br /><br />Now I'm not comparing a $13 razor to a $130. That would be grossly unfair. I just wanted to see if the blade was to blame, and frankly I didn't want to irritate my face more than necessary.<br /><br />I did a clean up and buffing pass, using the Wunderbar and got a BBS shave. However the feedback from alum block revealed a lot of irritation, not surprising given three indifferent and inefficient passes with the Acevivi, followed by another ATG pass and cleanup with the Wunderbar, though I don't blame the latter. No nicks, cuts, or weepers, but definite neck irritation.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The razor is well made, and low in price, and I admire the innovation, but I cannot recommend the Acevivi, unless you want to get a very long handle that's well made for under $13. It's possible that it will do better with other blades, but my initial impression is that it's not really worth testing. It's a fairly mild and quite inefficient razor.<br /><br />Is it good value? No! The Ming Shi 2000s Adjustable is cheaper (aroud $10 from China) and better in every possible way. The following razors, all under $20 are much, much better: The RazoRock (RR) German 37 Slant, the Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements  Bakelite slant, the RR Slab, the RR Mission, the RR Old Type, the RR Jaws (if you can get it), and probably some others too.<br /><br />It's a pretty poor razor, and even at the low price not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to newbies, because it will put them off DE shaving. Here's one to pass.\n",
      "8408->Moisturizing Clear Gel | 5 | 1 | I like trying new skincare products, and this one looked fun and festive. It comes in a little tube that is about 5\" tall and filled with confetti-like little dots in a clear gel. It smells sweet when you put it on. But, it doesn't look as cute on as it does in the listing photo, because the little jelly dots burst and disappear as you apply it. The clear mask feels nice and lightweight on and is meant to be worn overnight.<br /><br />I have normal but \"mature\" skin since I am in my 40s. This mask gave me a little moisture boost. I like that it has cleaner ingredients and that the company is committed to being cruelty free and environmentally friendly. I think it is a good product for the price.\n",

The material has a good strong feel, and it is large enough that it nearly feels like a washcloth. I can really get my hand on it. The packets easily tear open. The cloth, once wet becomes crazy sudsy. It has a barely there scent. I really have to sniff to be able to detect anything. Very fresh.  The lather is gentle and non drying. I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a \"bird bath\" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that... I didn't look.<br /><br />But for travel: definite yes. I would go so far as to use one in the shower to take care of face and entire body. The cleanser is so gentle, which is a huge draw for me and my dry/rosacea skin.\n",
      "8456->Love the angles on this blender sponge; since it is dense liquid foundation does not absorb easily | 4 | 1 | This is a lovely blender sponge. I love that this is dense because it does not absorb liquid foundation as some other less dense sponges I tried previously<br /><br />What attracted me to this the most are the angles.The two flat sides are great for smooth applications. The tip is great for more precision, such as around the eye. The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99. Even though all the angles are not in one sponge, the functionality is still there and they are dense, which I like.\n",
      "8457->Favorite Hair Product, ever | 5 | 1 | Received this in a paid subscription beautu box. I have used coconut oil on my hair before but this is so much more efficient.<br /><br />This product has done wonders for my hair and scalp. I leave it on over night. The next day people always ask what I've done different with my hair. It makes my hair so shiny and silky.<br /><br />The pack has enough for several uses (depending on how thick/long your hair is). My hair is shoulder length and so far I have been able to use one pack 4 times. Definitely worth the price!\n",

      "8465->Leaves hair feeling soft, but does have a strong scent | 3 | 1 | It's a strong almond plus something frangrance. It's not horrible, but my mother asked me if I smelled cigarettes when she stood next to me (and I have never smoked). I used it for the last few days, so after last night's comment, I decided NOT to use it this AM. I used generic grocery store conditioner (Tresemme)  and I can still smell the strong almond fragrance.<br /><br />I won't return it because I think it works well, but I won't buy it again just because there has to be something that works out there that doesn't have quite as strong a frangrance. I'm wondering if this stuff is what's giving me headaches the last few days...<br /><br />Take Note: If you're sensitive to frangrance, while this smells nice, it may not be the product for you. Bummer because I really like how my hair feels.\n",
      "8481->Matte Coat is TRASH | 2 | 1 | These are not as good qualities as the real one, the must be altered or something. The matte top coat, i typically have and have never had a problem but was out so ordered on Amazon. This matte coat is cloudy and white as it goes on and stays that way! Not like the  normal one at all. The top it off coat is okay- but doesn't harden the way the normal one does and indents so easily.<br /><br />You can't even return because it's flammable, otherwise i would return...\n",
      "8491->It WAS nice until it stopped working. | 2 | 1 | I really liked this product. It DID put out a decent amount of aroma. Yes, it is louder than my other diffuser but the lighting option and white noise canceled that out. For me at least.<br />The last straw, However, it no longer runs. So…in short, it is a $40 nightlight.<br />FAIL.\n",
      "8493->Nice thin bangs | 5 | 1 | Fabulous for price<br />Didnt match but I loved it\n",
      "8507->Needs Work | 3 | 1 | I thought this product was the answer to a problem....but it wasn't.<br /><br />TBH, its a great idea....but there are a couple flaws that need to be addressed. First, the claim that it will stick to all tub or shower surfaces is a fallacy that most people who own fiberglass tubs and showers should know. If you have a slippery tile or enamel floor to your bathtub or shower you will be good to go. But who wants to have a slippery shower floor?<br /><br />The second flaw is the curved piece that sits over the base.  If it had been designed properly, that piece would have been made from a bendable silicone so that if your foot hit it you wouldn't end up cursing a blue streak. But I am sure that was a money decision....easier to mold a one piece product than to have to assemble 2 pieces.<br /><br />As for the pumace breaking, I don't feel the product is meant to stand on with your full weight. My stone has not broken because I am careful not to stand on it.<br /><br />I can only give this 3 stars. I continue to use it, albeit carefully. But unless the design changes I can't really recommend it.\n",
      "8534->Love this razer, just like I loved the previous model (same razer) | 5 | 1 | Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the \"Speed-XL\" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.\n",

      "8561->Great value and soooo soft! | 5 | 1 | I picked these up based on reviews in a makeup group I belong to. I am always on the hunt for good brushes but can't get over the sticker shock of $50 each at Ulta/Sephora. These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I've felt there. I'm sure they won't hold up as long as the brand name brushes but I can buy 4 sets of these for the price of one brush there. They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs. They also came with a description of each brush and how to use it. They are well balanced and I LOVE the case they come in. It's really cute and perfect for rolling up when you travel! I would definitely recommend these brushes.<br /><br />My one complaint is the toxic smell when you first open them up however they arrived while I was home on my lunch break so I left them open on the counter and by the time I returned home that night I couldn't smell a thing.\n",
      "8564->Works well | 4 | 1 | For the price, I really like it.  It was nice to order online and not have to shop at a store for shampoo!<br /><br />I agree with the others, when you first start using it, it's very strong scented.  I suggest shaking it up if you can...because I'm half through the bottles and it's not as intense (maybe I'm just used to it..but I doubt that since I don't use it daily).  I sometime think the scents settle and come out first.\n",

      "8578->Great liner! | 5 | 1 | I really love this liner. It goes on easily and dries quickly. It lasts a long time.<br />I would buy again and try other colors. I got the black one first.\n",
      "8586->Not worth it. | 1 | 1 | It doesn't fit my blow dryer at all. Thank goodness I finally found a blow dryer that comes with the comb attachment.<br /><br />The instructions are also very confusing and they don't explain how to assemble this product well.<br /><br />I also don't think the quality was very good considering the price.\n",
      "8596->Small | 2 | 1 | I'm a little disappointed how small it is. It doesn't specify in the description how big it is, but its half the size of a normal thing of nail polish.<br /><br /> I'll attach a normal size of nail polish compared to this. Also, it came in a huge box and I think that was very unnecessary.\n",
      "8605->Black, not Clear. Fits, but not well. | 3 | 1 | I have a F5790 and the original clear cover cracked and I've been looking for a replacement. This one works, but it is black as the 2nd picture shows, and not clear, like the 1st picture. Also, it fits, but not that well and takes some effort to place correctly so it doesn't pop off.<br /><br />Good enough for me at this price, but I wish it was better.\n",
      "8632->Not worth the money | 2 | 1 | Not worth the money. I thought this would be a luxury moisturizer with light coverage and a healthy glow. It was recommended to combat redness, even complexion, use alone or under makeup.<br />I was so disappointed! No coverage. It did nothing to neutralize redness.\n",
      "8633->Not life changing but serves its purpose | 3 | 1 | I just wanted hot pink coffin shaped nails & that what I received .<br /><br />It does not come with glue I used my own .

      "8660->III Sisters of Nature Coconut Milk Cleansing Co-Wash | 3 | 1 | This co-wash has some interesting ingredients for its self-proclaimed title of a &#34;cleansing co-wash&#34; but a quick look- up of the ingredients doesn't reveal a cleansing agent.  It is a moisturizing co-wash made up of mainly oils & butter which are good ingredients to use during colder months.  I've used this product 3 times (twice after a hot oil treatment) and had more positive results after the hot oil treatment, rinsing with warm water: my scalp felt cleansed and curls were moisturized with minimal frizz.  When I used it as a straight co-wash & rinsed with cool water, my hair felt overly coated & slimy and only felt clean after a prolonged rinsing.<br /><br />Positives: Able to work the product throughout hair after initially applying it to my scalp & roots; very thick product so a little goes a long way; hair felt moisturized after rinsing; brought curls to life; fairly cheap at Beauty Supply stores.<br /><br />Negatives: Strong unpleasant scent that lingers after rinsing (smells like cherry cough syrup); can be too heavy for thin/fine hair if too much product is used or if not completely rinsed out; hair didn't feel 100% clean after rinsing; difficult to find on the ground.<br /><br />Although the product is giving me a good base to begin my wash day regimen during these colder months, I can recreate the same effect by adding oils to any cheap conditioner so I won't repurchase it.\n",
      "8668->Cute and Sparkly | 3 | 1 | Bought this for my 3-year-old grand daughter.  Cute and makes her feel like a queen or princess, depending on the day.  She has learned to put it on by sliding it from the front of her forehead instead of sitting it on the top of her head and pushing down........she doesn't have it on for long but it's a fun toy......  It came in a little plastic container, (flimsy but served the purpose), so no worries about it getting bent during transit and it came with a couple of replacement stones for the 'more serious wearer'.<br />Update:  This is still as cute as ever but we've had to gorilla glue/clothes pin it twice.......she hasn't been rough with it and hasn't bent it.....it just breaks and comes off the band....maybe they should have soldered it in a few more places or something.  Because we've had to repair it, I am knocking it down to 3 stars.\n",
      "8669->Great Product, Good Results | 5 | 1 | This is great for adding a little color to your hair gradually. It needs to be used a few times, and you will see the difference.<br />It is also like a hair conditioner. Use along with their companion shampoo for best results.\n",

I am always searching for the newest and the best cleansers and treatments.<br /><br />I really love organic cleansers because they are very gentle on the face and don't load my pores down with nasty chemicals.<br /><br />This is a charcoal based wash and we all know charcoal is a purifier. This cleanser does not foam, however, you can feel it cleaning. It has a pleasant scent and is amazing at removing makeup. I have found a little bit will do it, you don't have to use a lot of cleanser to clean your face.<br /><br />I haven't seen any miracle results but I will tell you it does clean well.<br /><br />Overall a decent cleanser. Price wise a little steep but with Organics you're always going to pay more.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

      "8682->Light and shimmery | 3 | 1 | Wasnt quite the color i was looking for. Was hoping it was smokier..and its quite light..bright silver. More appropriate for a highlight under your brow, etc .<br />I love this brand, i was just looking for a different result.\n",
      "8693->Buyer beware - comes without a user guide | 1 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:2e4786e03107c573adc8e58602166151]] I would suggest reading the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews. In order for this to work, the door has to shut. This door will not shut. There is no magnet or latch and there’s nothing in the box or unit that is loose. The directions aren’t great. There is no user guide, just a singular sheet of paper.  I took a video to show what I mean.<br /><br />Now we have a defective unit that we have to box up and deal with the return process. What a hassle. I will be looking at other units after we return this one. We won’t be using this seller again. One of the reviews says this isn’t a true UV sterilizer. I have no idea if that’s the case, but wouldn’t surprise me.\n",
      "8712->A Joke | 1 | 1 | My mother was offered a free trial of this stuff if she paid for postage.  She took it. When she got it we noticed she was being billed for the product which should have been free. Thankfully ,her credit card handled it for her . Because of her upset she refused to touch the product so it sat on her shelf till I asked her to try it.<br /><br />I have a good amount of experience with facial products. I could easily write factual informational blogs on them. At first, I was excited as the package labeling said \"no this\" and \"no that\" in regard to harmful ingredients and I was happy it seemed to be fragrance free. However, the proof is in the pudding. The cream was overly thick-the consistence of lard. Although it did eventually absorb after awhile it left my skin dryer to the touch than before putting the cream on.<br /><br />The performance of the cream in addition to the deceptive practices, result in a one star rating from me.\n",
      "8743->I give it 1 star for the color being right. | 1 | 1 | I don't know if this wig is a knockoff or what, but this is the first time that I've ordered a wig that was so terrible that I didn't just keep it since it was under 20 dollars.<br /><br />It's super shiny and the fibers are low quality. Imagine the look and feel of the wigs in Halloween stores. But honestly I could fix and look past that.<br /><br />But what I can't forgive is that horrible section they are calling bangs. It seriously looks like the wig was parted in the middle and then they decided to turn it into the pictured hairstyle. However instead of reworking the wig the just added the bangs in front of the freaking part.<br /><br />It looks terrible and the hair won't lay right because of the placement. Unless your planning on always wearing a hat I do no reccomend.<br /><br />I really wish I took a picture before packing it back up, but I didn't think to when I tried it because I didnt want a reminder of how bad that wig looked.\n",
      "8750->Horrible | 1 | 1 | Zero stars<br />Since we’re all quarantined I wanted to paint my own nails.  though this would be nice since It has multiple colors, however, polish is dry or has the texture of slime which makes impossible to use\n",

      "8761->Good for Calming Frizzy Hair | 4 | 1 | This argan oil and shea butter serum works pretty well. I use it on really dry days. When it is dry and cold my hair is crazy. It sticks out every which way and is impossible to make it lay flat or be reasonable. This stuff helps calm it down. It makes it actually lay down and gives it a smooth look. It does take some practice at applying it. If I get distracted it is easy to put too much and make my hair look oily. I have used product like this in the past that come in spray bottles or pump bottles and that made it easier to get just what I needed. This bottle has an eye dropper type applicator. I am not a fan of this. I use it to drop some into the palm of my hand and then rub it between my hands and carefully apply it to my hair starting in the back on the most underneath layer that way the front and the top layer do not get too oily. After applying it I gently brush my hair to work it through completely. I regularly put way too much in my hands and wash it off so I don't over do it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "8764->Sleek and modern | 4 | 1 | I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!<br /><br />Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.<br /><br />- Kasia S.\n",

It's made from the slime of snails fed only oriental raisins\"!?<br /><br />I like the light fragrance, and loved the way it felt on my skin -- it gave my skin a great dewey quality that I really liked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a few days of using it, I got an enormous deep pimple on my cheek... and I almost never break out! Bummer, because I really loved the feel and smell and idea, but the weird totally-out-of-skin-character zit that I got tels me that it's not for me.\n",

It's water proof but gentle enough not burning my eyes. Cruelty free.

      "8803->Rock Hard like candle wax. | 1 | 1 | Hard as candle wax.<br />I’ve been using this exact product for years and years … the last two 3 pack’s I got are totally different.<br />My recommendation is to go to Walmart ( that’s about the only place I’ve seen this other than Amazon) and check to see if it’s creamy and somewhat soft and pliable .<br />I’d hold back buying from Amazon …<br />Maybe by touching it at a store you can find out if it’s rock hard or normal.<br />I hope they didn’t change the formula.\n",
      "8827->Not exactly for my tastes | 3 | 1 | I've been using various models of Philips Norelco shavers for the past 8 years and have always been happy with them. Each time I buy a bit more expensive model hoping I'll save even more time each morning...though I've never really saved much time!<br /><br />Since this model was distinctly different from the others I had purchased before, I thought it would be a revolutionary new experience shaving in the shower and/or with moisturizing lotion. To be honest, the experience wasn't really any different and took me the same amount of time. The lotion adds an additional consumable requirement, and shaving in the shower seems such a waste of water. Not to say, however, that they don't contribute slightly to a great shave.<br /><br />For those moments when I decide to shave OUT of the shower, the fact that there is no place for the stubble (cut hairs) to go besides down on you is a bit inconvenient. I understand why a model like this has such a requirement, but it's inconvenient when you're all dressed and you've got to watch for anything that might be on your shirt. I'm not shaving a beard everyday or anything but the good news is that most of the stubble seems to stick near the plastic head. As long as you rinse well after every use, you're probably in great shape.<br /><br />It's a bit inconvenient, for travel usage, that you've got to carry around the charging dock/cradle and can't plug the AC right into the shaver. On the other hand, the shaver has a lithium ion battery (not familiar with many models with this feature) that seems to last a long time and charge quickly when needed.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'll still happily use this shaver. It does its job well, it's just that I'm not the target market for all the fancy wet/lotion features inside. Given that I rarely/never use the old fashioned razor and shaving cream, it's probably not a surprise. I'm guessing I'm not the market Norelco targets this model towards.\n",

      "8848->Scent is Overpowering | 2 | 1 | Let me start by saying I love french-milled soaps. I love scented soap. I love guest/sample size soaps. I adore the delightful concept and packaging design of this set. It was on my wish list and I received it as a gift. I was looking very forward to having these soaps to add some holiday cheer to my home.<br /><br />Here's what happened. The person that purchased it for me was so overwhelmed by the strong scent that he had to triple bag the box and store it in a vacant room until Christmas. Each soap is individually wrapped. They're wrapped in plastic. Then in a box. Then they're double bagged in two ziploc bags. Then placed in yet another box, wrapped with wrapping paper. The box was under my tree for two days, and scent still managed to seep out and perfume all the other gifts under the tree nearby - but not in a pleasant way. When this was unwrapped Christmas morning it was so unbelievably overpowering my eyes watered. I didn't even bother to look closely at them - I could not get them back inside their ziplocs fast enough. People got headaches and complained loudly.. The entire downstairs smelled like a soap factory instead of the fresh cinnamon rolls I baked for Christmas morning. The soaps are now safely contained in their hazmat bags and stored in the laundry room instead of the guest bath. :(<br /><br />I'm really kind of bummed about this because I was so excited about these soaps. I want to try them or at least take them out and smell each one on its own, but I'm afraid to now.<br /><br />Greenwich Bay, if you read these reviews: please, please, PLEASE turn the scent levels down several notches in the recipe for these soaps. I think the scent must develop stronger as the soaps &#34;ripen&#34; because it's just much too much. Way more than any other french milled soaps I own.\n",
      "8850->Great...BUT Beware of Size Issues | 3 | 1 | EDIT - I wrote the review below and then I realized that each page has it's specific style AND varied SIZES.  I didn't realize this at first.  This fact alone will lead me to not buy them again.  It's common to mess up on ONE brow in a pair.  Its nice to be able to go to your page and just cut off a new one and not worry if it's the same size as the others.  I only like the bigger (longer) brows, so I won't even want to use half the brows on each page.  Major issue for me.  I'll leave the tips below, because if you don't care about size differences, maybe this info will help you.<br /><br />1-  They are overall amazing!<br />2-  They take some practice, but it's worth it.<br />3-  When I mess up, I remove them with alcohol and toilet tissue.  I wet it with alcohol and rub with dry toilet tissue.  The dry helps rub the transfer off.  It's not super pleasant, but it works.<br />5-  They last for me for two full days.<br />6-  As crazy as it sounds, I followed the advice of someone here and shaved my (small) brows after trying to apply over my natural brows.  I was very freaked out about shaving my brows, but my brows sucked anyhow and it improved the look of these by far!<br />7-  My advice is to try all or almost all of the varieties sent in the package.  It can't hurt to try, right?!  Remember you can always remove them if you really can't stand them. Some of the ones that looked very odd on paper, looked not bad on me!  Some look better on \"natural\" days and some look better with make-up.  I wear the ones I don't hate on days I'm just staying home and I save my favs for the days I go out.<br />8-  The eyebrow print is on the front AND the back, so you can hold them up in the mirror to place correctly.  Super helpful.<br />9-  Again, overall these look very natural!  To eliminate the shiny look they can have a little brush of power foundation works, but I have found that a little water splashed on my face after helps too.\n",
      "8864->Not perfect, but it did the job. | 3 | 1 | I used an entire bottle of Hairspray on this wig, and it still didn't keep its shape for long. I realize this is the nature of wigs that stand straight up, but I did have high hopes for it.<br /><br />I'll mention that it DID stay standing up all day. Just didn't keep the flame-shaped point at the top. 🔥<br /><br />The quality was a bit lacking, and hairs kept falling out, but for only $12, I can't complain too much.\n",
      "8896->I'm happy with the brush | 4 | 1 | I'm happy with the brush.  The bristles are just right; they scrub well but don't hurt.  As another reviewer noted, the handle could be longer, but it'll do.<br />Later, disposal is very easy by just tossing it into the wood stove; no plastic.\n",
      "8897->Still Using Them | 4 | 1 | I found this bargain from a dentist on Amazon. I didn't expect much. They are great. I like the fact that they have a small head. Being Oral B, you know you have a good product. I have TMJ, my mouth can not open very wide without pain. So these smaller brushes work well for me. They are not tiny, as for a child, just a little smaller that most brushes. A good feature also is, they have a stripe in the middle of the brush. This will diminish in color, as the brush needs to be replaced. So you don't have to think how long you have been using the s<br />ame brush. The brush tells you!  MAK, PA\n",
      "8898->Quite spendy and not the best flavor. I use to be able to get ... | 3 | 1 | Quite spendy and not the best flavor. I use to be able to get this bulk at the health food store and this just doesn't taste quite the same.<br />Not much of a chocolate taste.\n",
      "8908->24 hour stay guaranteed! | 5 | 1 | One of the best brow pomades out there!<br />If you wipe your brows with witch hazel first and wipe off any unnecessary natural oils, will last over 24 hours!  I’ve gone a few days without touching them just washing around the brows by Mixing a drop of ingolt duraline with it. It made it more fluidly and easier to apply, especially when the pomade(any really) starts to dry up.\n",

      "8912->Horrid | 2 | 1 | If I could I would give this minus stars. It's horrible. The shampoo does not lather and the conditioner does not condition. It does not smell good and it left my hair feeling like straw. Very dry straw. I do not recommend this. You will be sorry.<br />To be fair though this does cut down on that brassy or yellowish look.<br />I hate giving bad reviews but this product is no good.\n",
      "8919->Great glass files | 4 | 1 | These files are fantastic. I really like the fact that they're not etched like any other glass file. They do a great job at filing natural nails without all that ear splitting, teeth hurting, grinding noise other glass files make.<br /><br />As far as buffing/polishing goes, yes, they do make a naked, natural nail shiny.  But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.\n",
      "8928->Good temporary tint | 4 | 1 | This tint kit comes with all the essentials you need. I like that it has an angled brush for application, I'm able to be more precise. The mix, color and application are all great. The reason I docked one start is because it fades quickly. Part of eyebrow tinting is that it dyes your skin in the sparse areas to make it look more full, however, the skin dye comes off after a day (two max). You will have perfect eyebrows for one day and after that the hair stays dyed for about 5 days.<br /><br />For the price I'm very happy and will buy this again. While it doesn't last a full week it dramatically cut down on the time it takes me to do my eyebrows in the morning.\n",
      "8931->Unique and bold but very small | 3 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:9daa366e09bb962fb4fcc631e8e74e09]] For the price I wish their was more in the bottles. I can forsee this not lasting with multiple girls. Very wet/runny. Slow dry. Easy to wash off kids skin. Beautiful bold colors. Easy to open bottles. Hope the brushes stay attached unlike other kid nail polish brushes.<br />Thanks if you watched the bad video (still new to that)\n",
      "8952->Dissapointed | 2 | 1 | I bought this to replace a Norelco 6848XL (about 10 years old?) that has worked well, but is beginning to have poor battery life.  This new 8140XL appears to me to be cheaply built, to the point that I find myself still leaning towards using the older model.  In more detail, the cutting heads are slightly larger on the 8140, but much less smooth (even painful to an extent) than the older model.  Also, the cutting head is held on to the 8140 by a very sloppy connection and falls off very easily when you are trying to clean it.  The whole general construction of the 8140 seems to much less \"solid\" than the older 6848.<br /><br />In short, Norelco seems to have gone towards cheaper cosnstruction in an attempt to save on costs (and yes, to be able to offer the 8140 at a \"low\" cost to the consumer).  However, this consumer is not impressed.  In hindsight, I should have instead sent the 6848 in for new batteries.\n",
      "8960->12 very pretty double banded headbands that fit well | 4 | 1 | The colors and design of these 12 headbands are super attractive. They are all double banded and most have a \"knot\" in the middle that can be worn in the center of the head or at the base of the neck. I personally do not like knots in my headbands but these are versatile enough to position the knot away from the forehead  without losing the good look of the band.<br /><br />The colors are great and there is a design for almost every outfit.<br /><br />Also, the current price of $18.99  comes to a reasonable $1.58 per band. These are definitely pretty and functional and they fit well. There was only one where the material was a hair looser on one side than the other for the top part of the double band. All the others were sewn perfectly.\n",
      "8968->Not a fan | 2 | 1 | This thing stalls out on my acrylic nails, and yet it actually burned me when I tried it on my natural toe nails (apparently, I wasn't moving it around enough, or maybe my toe nails are flimsy), so I really don't know what you're supposed to use it for. I'm not happy with it, but it's not the kind of thing you can really return once you've used it. I don't know, maybe you can, but I didn't try.<br /><br />So it sits there, neatly and quietly charging til I figure out if it will work for my polymer clay stuff. It probably will, but since I bought it for nails and it won't work for that, I can't rate it very highly.\n",
      "8999->A Nail Tech's View: I really like this gel! | 5 | 1 | The Builder Nail Gels Kit in Clear & Pink is medium to semi thin ~ especially if it is used in warm temperatures. It is nothing like polygel, though it includes a slip solution. The clear is really clear and the pink is nice, also, though I don't use colors a lot. This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel. You also get a large amount of product to work with. It will last me a while. I love working with it, and would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "9007->Nice idea, over priced with unnecessary/fewer features than competition. | 3 | 1 | The circular buzzer is ok but it would be nice to have flat attachment to get the harder to reach areas toward the front of the nose.<br /><br />The light feature is not helpful. It actually shines right into my eyes so I have to close my eyes. It's very bright and blinding and annoying.<br />It's also very hot to the touch after a few seconds so I'm forced to rush.\n",
      "9009->Soothing Comfort - A Hand Cream That Exceeds Expectations! | 5 | 1 | Goop Beauty's hand cream is soothing and deeply moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands looking nourished and hydrated. The skin on your hand will almost look a little plump, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I had high expectations for this cream after trying the lip balm and I was not disappointed. The tube is fairly small, but perfect for a purse or pocket. I have my tube on my bedside table for use before bed. This is one of the best hand creams you will ever use. The secret? Shea butter as one of the top ingredients. You may want to get more than one tube! With all the handwashing we've all done in the past two years it is nice to have a cream that is protective and healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "9015->I have BO while using it | 1 | 1 | Simple review- I applied it this morning, re-applied when I got to work because I felt sweaty. I got home and asked my husband if I had BO and he said I did, he wasn't even smelling too close to my arm. I also noticed I had BO yesterday while using it.<br /><br />It won't prevent the stink.\n",
      "9028->My hubby likes his new shaver | 4 | 1 | My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him. Here is what he had to say after using it:<br /><br />I've used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \"wet\" system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.<br /><br />To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.<br /><br />Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I've starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men's would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.<br /><br />I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.<br /><br />The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn't want to cut any hairs. But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.<br /><br />I also find the conditioner application button is in a position that I want to place my fingers when using the shaver, so occasionally I'll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner. A pretty minor issue.<br /><br />The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I'm blind as a bat without my glasses on.<br /><br />I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception: ­ there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin. I like my new shaver.\n",
      "9038->Shocked at how well it worked. | 5 | 1 | This Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover is great. I used it to remove my Christmas gel nail polish. I was surprised at well it worked.<br /><br />The box comes with a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle of gel nail polish remover and a pump bottle. It also comes with a pack of cotton pads and a pack of nail clips. Also included is a file and cuticle pusher. Instructions are included.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Morovan Gel Nail Polish Remover to family and friends.\n",
      "9045->Used item sold for new | 1 | 1 | This was suppose to be a new item, however the box had been taped and the return shipping slip was included in the box.<br />If I wanted an used light I would have ask for an used light.<br />Not happy!!!\n",
      "9048->Revised review...😔 | 3 | 1 | Foundation is fine it doesn't feel heavy BUT the pump quit working  so I would be interested to know if others have had this same problem.<br />UPDATE:The top of the bottle unscrews so I am able to get the makeup out of the bottle. About the makeup, when you apply it, let it set for awhile before to review it. Seems like it looks better the longer it sets.\n",
      "9064->Save your Money | 2 | 1 | I am really big on Organic & safe products.  I was very excited about this lip amplifier having given up on them when I discovered how toxic they were.  Sadly this product turned out to be a big disappointment & I will not purchase again.<br /><br />The only thing to like about this product is it's good safety rating in the EWG Cosmetics Database & it provides a nice shine.  That's where it ends.<br /><br />It smells unpleasant.  It is very very watery & thin.  It says to apply generously.  If you try to do that it will be all over your face.  It does not last long & it is not moisturizing.  It does not plump the lips(I have yet to find a product that does) & it is not the best tasting.<br /><br />Save your money.  It is wasted on this product.\n",
      "9071->Hair Tangles Way Too Much, Color T27 | 2 | 1 | I truly believe this hair was used, unfortunately I had made an appointment for an install, so I couldn't return it. If you notice, I have two different colors, and the hair is already frizzy right out of the pack. The hair tangles alot, everyday, I am spraying it, and adding conditioner. I use a silk scarf at night, I twist it, and spray it. Still every morning, I have to detangle and cut the knots, and strands. If I am lucky it might last a month. I wouldn't recommend getting this hair.<br /><br />**Update as of August 24th. The seller and I was in contact regarding this review, they wanted to make a wrong right, and I do appreciate that, not once did they ask me to change my review. I must say they are concern about their customers, and they have excellent customer service. I am very pleased with the end result, once I communicated with them directly. They deserve 10 stars, for their excellent customer service skills. Thank you very much.\n",
      "9081->Good for home made formulas. Perfect for travelling. | 5 | 1 | That's a good product, good quality, and good value.<br />I like to create my own formulas with no chemicals.<br />I fill up the bottles with goodies. Non-harmfull cleaning mixtures, natural anti mosquitos,  natural odors, and natural hand sanitizers.<br />The size is perfect for traveling and is very easy to hold.\n",
      "9083->Different from what I expected | 4 | 1 | Spa-Da Immunity Support Soap 6pk | 7 Essential Oils Clinically Evaluated to Boost Immunity and Protect | Moisturizes with Sweet Almond Oil | Healthy PH for Skin Microbiome | Handmade in Ohio-<br /><br />Pros-<br />Great for exfoliating<br />Hydrating<br />Skin feels great after usage<br />Made in the USA<br /><br />Cons-<br />The scent is very strong of clove (too much so for me) It's the only scent I can smell from the soap.<br />Breaks down very fast<br />Fewer suds than traditional soap ( more suds than I would have thought but still less)<br /><br />I was a bit thrown off by this soap.  Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it’s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br /><br />Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don’t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br /><br />After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn’t last long.<br /><br />The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it’s very strongly clove-scented.  It’s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent product but it’s not really for me.  I just don’t love the scent and it’s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.  That is the one area I really liked and I would buy this if I found a scent I enjoyed.  The price is reasonable given that you get 6 bars.  I would say they last maybe 1/3rd to 1/4th of the length of most bar soaps and that might be a stretch.\n",
      "9086->At least 1 pump is ALWAYS broken!! For $50/bottle? Come on! | 3 | 1 | How can a shampoo and conditioner duo (or individual bottles) that costs $50 per bottle always come with at least 1 broken pump every time? GKhair? I notice you don't answer these questions in the \"question\" section, only questions about smells and which product to choose.<br /><br />How can all the $3-5 hair products in the grocery have working pumps and you can't get a pump to work for $50/bottle? Yes, at 33.8 oz it's a longer pump and has thicker product, but that is NOT the issue because the pumps don't even pop up after unscrewing (well, trying to) to attempt to pump shampoo or conditioner. I turned my sister onto your products years ago and now she has the same problem I do.<br /><br />I like the product and have strong allergies to fragrance, so it's hard to find a product I can tolerate and I usually stick to it until the fragrance gets changed. But when I have to use the conditioner like a big dipstick and get wasted product all over because the pump won't even unscrew, it's ridiculous!<br /><br />Please fix this as you will see many comments mentioning this problem - clearly it's not just me and my sister (who live in different states and get the product from different places). Don't you care about your customers sticking around??\n",
      "9092->Great comb, case is NOT leather | 4 | 1 | The comb is great. Real simple. It’s quite a bit like a ton of the other combs you can find just like it on amazon or in stores.<br /><br />The case on the other hand is not leather as advertised so just know that upfront. It has a leather feel but it’s obvious when you inspect it, it’s not leather.<br /><br />No problems with the product or case, shipped quick and does the job. Just missed a star for the minor misleading.\n",
      "9098->Overpriced but good | 5 | 1 | After a shower and with wet hair, you apply this cream, and your curls form with a soft set (not hard and crunchy) that look defined and bouncy. It’s light, so you won’t add so much weight that curls turn to waves, and the scent is subtle and delicate.<br />Having said that, this is comparable to cheaper products I use like L’Oréal Curve It Curl Taming Cream, and that’s Much more cost effective (current price of $3.99 Prime).\n",
      "9124->meh | 2 | 1 | This isn't bayalage, this is straight up ombre. I had to add some lowlights to break up the harsh line.  Hair felt nice out of the package.<br /><br />Hair does not hold up well after washing. I use Kevin Murphy products and the blonde still felt dry.<br /><br />The adhesive it comes with is garbage. I've had these in for 5 days already took 6 sets out. I barely had to us any remover.  there are far better brands at the same price point.<br /><br />keep looking ladies.\n",
      "9143->Love the color! | 5 | 1 | For reference, I have a very fair, cool type skintone.<br />These reds are so classic! It dries so quickly though, so get your outline right. It is long wear, most definitely, but other long wear lipsticks survive lunch, this one does not. No big deal though, just reapply\n",
      "9152->Very inclusive set | 4 | 1 | This set has a lot to it! There are 24 eyebrow shapes, a facial razor, a brush/spoolie combo, and a two colored powder.  The powder has a darker tone and a lighter tone, and both apply easily with the rounded foam head. The powder itself is stored in the cap so it refreshes each time you close it.<br /><br />The 24 eyebrow styles are a bit overwhelming but maybe some people like to have that much choice. The shapes all need to have the center pushed out of the plastic before use; they come with it still tacked on in place.<br /><br />The brush and spoolie are small so I recommend using your own as this one is hard to hold.  The facial razor works as expected and the folding design makes it a little safer to store.<br /><br />Overall, a good set at a decent price\n",
      "9158->You Get What You Pay For | 3 | 1 | I've been cutting my husband's hair at home for about a year and needed to up my game.<br /><br />The cape is large and almost too light. Hair electrostatically clings to it, which may not be a plus. Let's see if it survives a cold water wash.<br /><br />I haven't quite figured out the closures. They don't hook together unless you twist them. Perhaps they are supposed to hook over collars, but there are no directions telling you so. And it is not really large enough to overlap in the back and block out that hair.<br /><br />The brush worked for the purpose but it more of a large cosmetic kabuki brush than a neck duster.\n",

      "9181->wanted olive oil cleanser. got one. BOOM. | 5 | 1 | Having grown accustomed to the fragrance of olive oil in an olive oil cleanser I had been using, after I previous stopped using a different one based on some not-so-natural ingredients, I went online to re-order...but the one I had begun using was no longer being carried by the store I frequent...and the search continued through a myriad of oil cleansers that were not actually olive oil cleansers, even though that was the basis of my search.<br />Long story not so short, I found this one. Yes, it is not just olive oil, but it is pretty natural and does have that fragrance---and does not cost as much as others! So I am happy.\n",

      "9216->Not talc anymore | 1 | 1 | It appears that, due to an observational study finding a small correlation between talc and cancer, many now believe that ‘science has prove talc bad‘.  This is due, primarily, to ubiquitous misunderstanding of what constitutes ’science’ and how enormous a difference there is between the reliability of actual science and observational studies—the former, after repeated and properly-designed experiments, provides a strong basis for causal inference, while observational studies provide little more than a reason to conduct an experiment.  Of course, we never hear about any actual experimental results, i.e. actual science, with things like this, because, either the observation result was merely promoted as a sensational headline and the people who conducted it know very well a minor correlation doesn’t even justify the time and expense of an experiment, or because experiments were conducted and didn’t produce the sensational result.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when media takes advantage of this widespread misunderstanding, good products are removed from shelves and good companies producing good products lose money.  Here, it appears the company chose to give in to the hysteria, which is a shame.  I suspect that, if their actual customers had much of a voice, they’d find out this was a bad decision.  They may find out anyway after people get tired of gelatinous gravy covering parts of their bodies after rubbing corn starch on them and sweating.\n",
      "9222->The cream is blue but goes on clear; it is very hydrating; looks like ½ a jar | 3 | 1 | The photo on Amazon must be wrong. This cream is blue and not white. I hate colored creams. However, this goes on clear and was so super hydrating to my face, that I did not mark it down for the color. Note that the box it came in was all smashed and it was almost double the size of the jar. They could have fit almost two jars of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks half full.<br /><br />I love the results but not the packaging or the color or the jar being half full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is wrong too.\n",

The scent of this is very strong.  It's a pleasant smell, but definitely strong.<br />2. I added a good amount of the oil to my conditioner and can definitely smell it in there, but I don't notice any difference in the softness of my hair like I did with the other argan oil conditioners.<br />3. As others have stated, it is very thin.  I don't think it is pure argan oil and it feels like it is watered down.<br /><br />Overall, I think I would look for a higher quality product.\n",
      "9231->Smaller than expected - mat wont come clean | 2 | 1 | I'm disappointed with the size of the brush cleaning mat. This would be best for travel, but not regular use. The mat holds onto the makeup and will not come clean despite my best efforts. Because the makeUp up remains on the mat I feel this would be a breeding place for bacteria.<br /><br />If you're looking for a product to clean your makeup brushes with in a regular basis this isn't the best option.\n",
      "9240->Almost no scent | 4 | 1 | Guys buying this stuff are doing it as much for the great scent as for their skin after shaving. The cream, soap and splash in the Venture set are not sillage monsters but they have far greater scent strength than the balm.<br /><br />Since balm is the final step of the shave, it should have a bit more fragrance I should think.<br /><br />So same great Captain’s Choice balm properties as all their flavors. But the beautiful Venture scent is unfortunately too weak to warrant a repeat purchase.<br /><br />If, however, you plan to use a cologne, the upside is this stuff won’t get in the way, and your face will feel terrific.\n",

The smell is really awful and if I hadn’t desperately needed this texture ( the store where I buy the RastaAfri brand was out of stock) I would’ve promptly returned this. Even after rinsing and spraying it with a spray designed for synthetic hair, it was still stinky!<br /><br />This hair has less of a tendency to tangle because it’s so hard and unyielding, so I’d rather have a few tangles than a stiff, itchy uncomfortable feeling. I was thinking about using it for crochet but decided against it because in addition to being itchy, the individual sections are almost impossible to separate easily.  Also, the 1b color needs a bit more brownish/red to make it blend perfectly with my natural hair color.<br />I did get a whole lot of hair that is finished well (lovely ends and segments) but I’ll go back to RastaAfri for this type of hair. Wish AMAZON would sell it as a Prime item!\n",
      "9253->Double disappointment | 2 | 1 | There are many eye-hydrating creams out there. But I was drawn by the way this product is presented. Being an artist myself, I recognized what they were trying to do; this cream looks like a tube of oil paint and I thought that was awesome.<br /><br />Sadly, once it was delivered I was disappointed in how cheap it looked and felt in my hands. For the price, I expected something better. And, even though we started with the wrong foot, I was still excited about the product inside. I gave it about a month, but up to this date, nothing has changed. No puffiness or dark circles removed. At least it didn't irritate my eyes, unlike other products I've tried. That's why it gets an extra star.\n",
      "9274->Love this product~! | 4 | 1 | I had one before and the applicator worked perfectly.  The one I bought this time, it's been harder to get the right amount of product out at the right time.

      "9332->A Valuable Addition To My Home & Hobby Tool Collections | 5 | 1 | I am a man with a full, somewhat wavy facial beard.. As individual hairs start to to die, they sometimes need to be pulled out. These tweezers are perfect for that, especially the angled ones, as they allow me to see around the hair to get a better grip on it before pulling. Additionally, the colored coating gives me enough of a resistance to the tweezers as to enhance the grip.<br /><br />I am also a modeller, sometimes working with 3-D exceedingly thin sheet metal materials [.2 mm] that are too thin to be picked up with this old man's big fingers. These tweezers are invaluable for both picking up / holding on to pieces, but for bending the sheet metal into position, locking the sheet metal tabs into place, and a quick buff up with a micro buffer.<br /><br />These tweezers have become a valuable addition to my home and hobby tool collection.\n",

      "9391->Not 100% Human Hair, but decent quality | 2 | 1 | Things to note: I waited 5 months to review the hair so I could give a fully informed review.  I've colored, curled, cut, styled, washed, deep conditioned, blow dryed, you name it! Here's my review:<br /><br />Pros-<br />• Affordable hair, 30+ inches will definitely cost more elsewhere, upwards of $350<br />• Takes coloring very well initially, I've only used watercolor meathod on any of my 613 hair.<br />• Straightens without much effort<br />• Holds curl but ONLY with flexi rods and mousse applied<br />• True to length with no odor or bugs after inspection<br />• Hair retained similar quality after being washed with swimmers shampoo (to remove gold tone/clean hair).<br /><br />Cons-<br />• After 2-3 months of consistent wear,  brushing and styling (Heat used sparingly, always with heat protectant) hair sheds uncontrollably. We're talking hair all 9ver every place I've stepped foot inside of.<br />• Hair will not hold heated curls, they fall within minutes<br />• Hair tangles and matts fairly easily in the nape<br />• Tons of split ends resulting in stragly looking hairs everywhere<br />• This is NOT 100% human hair, it is mixed with synthetic fibers, (I did do the burn test to confirm my suspicions).<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for something cheap and quick with minimal styling, this is it..<br />If you want an investment, hair you'll be able to revive and re-wear for a few months, baby, this ain't it. I'd recommend this hair for an event but not for a unit/ like in you want to get the most out of. Hair performed as expected for the price.\n",
      "9402->Omg | 2 | 1 | Wow. Im going crazy tring to get images of these plates. I tried all the tricks. Dont know what to do. May return them.<br />Ok. Many hour n tryies later..... Finaly. This set does work. But not for beginers. I noticed wiping them with Alot of acetone did help. But the stamper is still crap. Lol\n",
      "9431->Not for long or thick hair | 3 | 1 | This was my first time using hair chalk. After reading the reviews I was hopeful for good results with little mess.  Well, the results were just under satisfying and the mess was exactly what I was worried about.<br />It’s chalk, I get it. But there were so many reviews saying the color stayed in and didn’t rub off onto white clothing! Thank goodness my daughter’s costume was black.  Though we could still see blue/green on her shoulders and back. Her neck was blue/green for 3 days. And after 3 showers her hair still had color in it.<br />We used leave in conditioner and hairspray since I read many reviews advocating for them.  I think if your hair is short, this could benefit you. My daughters hair is long and thick, and it was awful. I tried not to brush, but I inevitably had to comb horrible knots caused by the chalk being rubbed onto damp hair. (And a spray bottle is a must, chalk on dry hair is a joke.) This caused much of the color to fly away in clouds of chalk.<br />True, her hair was colored blue/green, but it was not the vibrant color that initially came off of the chalk. It was muted at best.<br /><br />I strongly recommend doing this outside and with clothing on you don’t care about. Any tools you use in the process will subsequently get chalk all over it. Our flat and curling irons cleaned up easy enough.<br />I got some wet chalk on my light blue jeans and the color has stained.<br />When you iron your hair the chalk will dissipate in colorful clouds. And the remaining color will slowly work itself out on your clothes, chairs, couches, pillows, and eventually multiple showers.<br />I will say I chose chalk over dye for the benefit of no chemicals on my girl or in my house. But I think a mask would have helped, as we probably ended up inhaling tons of chalk!<br />Hope you have better luck than we did.\n",
      "9434->For the price, This is a Very Nice Set. | 4 | 1 | For the price, I think this is a very nice set.  The brushes are all soft and do a decent job applying makeup, I personally didn't have any shedding of my brushes, but I was reading other reviews and they washed them up and they shed everywhere.  I don't do that. I have never liked anything using a wet application... it annoys me, so that's something I didn't test for.  I can see this as a fabulous starter set for a teenager, or someone who just slaps on some blush and a little shadow before skipping out the door.  If you're planning to do any fancy techniques or anything. You might plan on paying a little more for your brushes.<br /><br />* I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

      "9436->Wonderful creamy face masks | 5 | 1 | ✨This mask has such a plush and soft feel so it adhered so well to the face’s contours. The essence is a thick and milky emulsion. My favorite feature is the scent though!! It has a very pleasant herbal fragrance, sort of like a creamy spicy essence of ginger.<br />•<br />💫Because of the thick essence texture, I was able to wear it for a long time before the mask dried up. The result was a VERY hydrated and moisturized face with lots of dewiness. And I even had enough leftover essence for my arms and legs. These masks are such winner🥇\n",

      "9465->Eh. | 2 | 1 | [[VIDEOID:7cd48f9d531b66f3743f8cccbffa1d0a]] I have bought similar displays like this before that have worked perfectly. This one I am not pleased with. The tops come off super easy so if you need to look at the bottom of the jar at a sticker price then you will have a hard time removing the jar. The foam also only fills 3/4 of the jar so if it’s pushed all the way down the jewelry does not stay still in the jar. I do like that this one is in a plastic case instead of a cardboard like others. I will be purchasing a different one and use this as back up.<br /><br />If you do not need to remove jars or do not care if the jewelry is not firmly in place then this will work fine. If you need to prop this up, remove jars or keep jewelry still I suggest purchasing a different one.\n",

However, it stopped working for me after 9 months and it's been a hassle trying to get seller contact info and product warranty info.<br /><br />Update: Change my rating from a 3 to 1. Have ordered this product twice, each time with the same outcome: a device that doesn't function after a couple of months. The company is impossible to get in touch with through Amazon or via their website/email.\n",
      "9488->good. | 3 | 1 | Works, for the most part, I like the scent and it wears good for almost three days if your not working out or doing any activity that results in sweat..<br />However, Three stars because of the stains it leaves on my clothes.\n",
      "9502->Nice product, with uncertain benefit to my dry skin | 4 | 1 | (Note: I received this as a review product.)<br /><br />Because my skin tends on the dry side, I avoid any product that says &#34;mask.&#34; That's because most masks are drying to my skin. But this product claims to be moisturizing, so I tried it.<br /><br />The product is clear, without the clay in many masks, so there is no spooky cracked mask-effect after 15-20 minutes. But it does dry &#34;taut.&#34;<br /><br />The benefits of rose hip oil seem straightforward enough, but this mask does not feel oily.  I'm also not sure what pro-vitamin B5 and an amino acid complex will do for my skin; I doubt published studies are devoted to this.<br /><br />The mask leaves my skin feeling soft and supple but definitely ready for moisturizer. I don't have the time for a regular routine with this mask, and I'm not sure it's worth it for me.\n",
      "9514->Great misting continuing sprayer! | 5 | 1 | This spray bottle gives a nice even mist when used.<br />My daughter has curly hair so I use this for her hair product.<br />The packaging shows that it would also work good for misting plants and de-wrinkling clothes.<br />The bottle holds 160ml (5.4oz).<br />When filling up the bottle make sure you don’t fill it over the line where the neck starts otherwise you are just waisting product.<br />It takes about 20 presses on the trigger to get the pressure built up for the sprayer.\n",
      "9521->Works, but ergonomics seem off | 3 | 1 | First the good things. It works. In fact, I found the battery life to be outstanding. I took the toothbrush on a 12 day trip and it lasted that long despite only being rated for 10 days. It cleans your teeth pretty well. I also like the pressure indicator that lets you know if you're pushing too hard. Because it's fully functional, I don't feel like I can give it less than 3 stars. But here's why it doesn't get more.<br /><br />First, the brush cycle. I've used other electric toothbrushes that also have the concept of a brush cycle, a beep, series of beeps, difference in the brush, whatever, that informs you to switch to a different area of your mouth. This toothbrush has that too and it works. Then it keeps working. The others I've used ran through the full cycle then turned off. This one, just kept going. You have to manually switch it off before it will stop. It's not a big deal since I know what part of my teeth I'm brushing, but it's part of the general  behavior that I don't like.<br /><br />Next, drool. Again, I've used other tooth brushes and I know that you have to maintain a good seal or you'll spray things everywhere and/or drool all over your chest. But with this brush, I was getting drool despite maintaining a good seal. I was very careful and always was leaking. Why exactly? I'm not sure, but I attribute it somehow to the shape or action or ergonomics.<br /><br />Finally, the easiest to fix, I think the brush is way to strong. If I were to continue using this, I'd need a softer brush.<br /><br />It might just be me, but I'm just not crazy about it even though it works adequately.\n",
      "9526->You can wear this for days. | 4 | 1 | If you're looking for a lip product that really, truly only needs to be applied once a day, this is it. This is my second LipTint from LA Splash (The other was Bellatrix/Belladonna) and both of these have stayed on my lips through 48 hours of wear until I decided to remove them. They lasted through eating, drinking, talking, sleeping, showering, exercising, and just about any other task you can expect to do throughout a day.<br /><br />If you've never used an LA-Splash LipTint, the first thing you're going to say about them is that they're super drying. I've found that the drying effect is really what keeps this stuff attached to your lips until you decide to remove it. My best advice is to keep your lips in good condition before its use. When I do this, my lips don't get that cracked appearance people tend to complain about when using LA-Splash LipTints. They look more like the advertised picture. When I remove it, I do a lip scrub and put on a little more lip balm and my lips are as good as new. For the longevity you get out of this stuff, it's hard to complain.<br /><br />This would get a 5 star review, but the color Gigi itself is much darker than I thought it would be and isn't the vibrant pink you see in the picture. I should have checked Instagram for what it would realistically look like on a real life human before purchasing it. I still absolutely love the color and wear it regularly, but it isn't what I was looking for. If you've already looked up pictures of people wearing Gigi and you like how the color looks, this will be a 5 star product for you.\n",
      "9528->Nice toothbrush | 4 | 1 | Got this a few weeks back when it was on sale.  I can't compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I've owned.  My dentist recommended the phillips brand but I chose this one over the price.  I love it.  If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one.  It's amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel.  I was skeptical at first - I just thought my dentist was trying to give me something I did not need.  I was wrong I'm glad I bought this one.<br /><br />It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.\n",
      "9533->travel sized bottle will provide many applications, works well, even better as day goes on | 5 | 1 | It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br /><br />DARK HAIR option: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JCXT18<br /><br />PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too. Look for formulas like this- just some clay and other body friendly ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Zea Mays (Corn Starch), Organic Maranta Arundinacea (Arrowroot) Powder, Yellow (Kaolin & Illite) Clay , Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Organic Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Powder, Organic Lavandula Hybrida (Lavander) Oil<br /><br />How to Use Organic Dry Shampoo<br /><br />1. Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until you see fine powder particles falling onto your hair. 4. Using a makeup brush or your fingertips, massage your shampoo into your scalp. Brush as usual, or (for extra body), use your fingertips to massage the shampoo into your hairline.\n",
      "9547->it's all right - the straightening iron works better in my opinion | 3 | 1 | it's all right - the straightening iron works better in my opinion, but this will give your hair a rest from it - the only thing is the on/off switch, which is placed awkwardly on the handle, so that while you are using the brush you inadvertently shut it off.  Also it takes some time to heat up, a little too long for me. Other than that it's ok, does a decent job but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />Update on my previous review: the brush just died. It only lasted a couple of months and I didn't even use it often.  Very disappointed - this ting was a waste of money, a piece  of junk. Do not buy.\n",
      "9560->Lovely Colors | 4 | 1 | These are so cute. They are made really well and the materials are strong. These are actually comfortable to wear and they stay in place.

This is a great value and the colors are lovely.<br /><br />*If my review of this item is helpful please hit the helpful button below to let Amazon know. Thank you!\n",
      "9567->Excessive handles, great brushes. | 4 | 1 | I'm no makeup pro but these brushes are soft and apply evenly. They are great at what they do! The only downside is the size. Can't take them anywhere when I travel because my suitcase space is precious. I bought a smaller two sided set for traveling that is easier to access.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the case they give you with these brushes. Because of the size of the brushes, the case is huge. I'd prefer to have a rectangular case so I can decide how to set these brushes in my cabinet based on my shelving needs.<br /><br />Other than the size of the brushes and the lack of versatility in the case, these brushes do a great job!\n",

      "9585->A simple and effective addition to skin care | 4 | 1 | The Wonderskin Derma roller seemed to be a prefect choice to see if micro needling was something I could incorporate into my facial routine. The unit itself came nicely packaged in it's own storage case which keeps it safe and clean when not in use. Instructions are printed on the box and suggest replacing the unit every 1 to 2 months.<br />I use the roller after washing and drying my face and before applying my facial cream. It doesn't hurt to use the roller but you do feel a prickly sensation. I'm hoping that the facial products I use are being better absorbed with use of the Wonderskin Derma Roller. I do notice a nice glow to my skin after using. I'm excited to see more improvement to my skin with continued use.\n",
      "9596->Beautiful compact mirror w/high-gloss shine; saying is one star less than special | 4 | 1 | This is a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside is nice but the last two words of \"I WIN!\" may be taken wrong; it depends on the girlfriend. <br /><br />TO MY<br /><br />Girlfriend<br /><br />NEVER FORGET THAT<br /><br />I love you<br /><br />THE MOST,<br />I WIN!<br /><br />In summary, this is a lovely gift in a nice gift box.

      "9600->Needs improvement. | 3 | 1 | I had high hopes for this product, unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. This is not like the Tyme iron, I know many may have the impression that's it's a generic version-- it definitely isn't. To begin, the two clamps do not make contact with one another when closed. Unless you use both hands to clamp it closed, you don't get a solid grip which prevents the convenience of using one hand to hold. The packaging is beautiful,  but for performance and practicality it needs a lot of improvement. 3 stars for design and a decent wand.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "9620->Great temporary tattoos!  Not just for kids anymore! | 5 | 1 | I love this company's products! This is it my first purchase of temporary tattoos from this company and so I am familiar with their brands and products.  I would definitely recommend their products if you're looking for high-quality tattoos that are modern and stylish.<br /><br /> These are super easy to put on and tends to stay for several days versus some of the other tattoos on the market.  The one I have in the picture below has been on for four days now and it still looks just like the day I applied at.<br /><br /> I love all of the different packs of variety so that you can get a pack of that suits your style and needs.  I would definitely recommend these. Application is really simple.  You pick the tattoo you want and place it in side down on your skin wherever you would like it to be. Just make sure it is straight and where you want it before you apply the wet paper towel.  You just take a wet paper towel and place it over the paper side of the tattoo. The other side you adhere to your skin. Then hold it there for 30 seconds, and when you left it off, the tattoo stays on your skin and the paper peels away. Then, just let it dry.<br /><br /> Love these! I highly recommend them. Happy shopping\n",
      "9626->Decent Pillow, but may not be suitable for Deeper Tubs | 4 | 1 | I was concerned that this bath pillow wouldn’t attach properly to a deep oval claw-footed tub, but it worked out fine. The suction cups are sturdy and easy to adhere, and they stay secure. However, for a deep tub, the pillow may be a bit short and sits too high, which would probably make it more suitable for a standard-sized bathtub.<br /><br />The bottom part could be a little more padded, but the material is durable, waterproof, and fast-drying. It’s reasonably comfortable and of decent quality, for the price.\n",

      "9645->17 months and still going strong | 4 | 1 | This is definitely the most inexpensive entry into the Sonicare line.  Well worth the price.<br /><br />Likes:<br />-Uses AA batteries, either disposable or rechargeable.  Works great with Sanyo Eneloop or similar \"pre-charged\" rechargeable batteries.<br />-Very inexpensive<br />-Uses same technology and brush heads as the far more expensive models.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-Lacks some of the features of the higher-end models, such as the little beep that prompts you to move on to a different quadrant of your mouth.<br />-No indication of low battery.  When the batteries are done, they're DONE.  Leaves me running around with a mouthfull of toothpaste while fumbling to replace the batteries.<br /><br />I've had mine for about 17 months with no issues other than periodic brush and battery replacement.  Recently added two more to the household for the kids.\n",

I am actually planning to collect the jumbo sets and I already got the set of #4 and have no complains<br />but this set #5 made me think that I should try a different brand or name of stamping plates.<br />just got it today and planning to return it right away.\n",

So tight! | 3 | 1 | They are so tight I feel like my head is going to pop.<br />I know what you’re thinking, but I swear I have a normal sized head.<br />Fortunately I only use them to hold my hair back when washing my face and putting on makeup.<br />On the upside there is enough headbands in the package I may never need to purchase another as long as I live.\n",

It's cut perfectly to the mold. If I try any hard I'll need a very sharp knife or will end up breaking a nail.<br /><br />FYI Easy to peel should mean attached pull tabs at the very minimum.\n",
      "9656->Moldy and not round Loofahs | 1 | 1 | I WOULD NOT GIVE A ONE STAR IF I COULD. THESE ARE NOT LIKE THE PHOTOS AT ALL.  THEY WERE FULL OF MOLD AND ARE NOT ROUND LIKE THE PHOTOS. THEY ARE GROSS. VERY DISAPPOINTING.<br />BECKY HIGGIE\n",
      "9662->Super Natural | 5 | 1 | Super love this wig, very soft and comfy....I would definitely wear this a lot. I just had to cut a lot to my liking....<br />Super speedy delivery! Planning to get another one, maybe blonde?!\n",
      "9664->Should have read more reviews | 1 | 1 | I've been lusting after this stupid color ever since I missed it when the collection dropped. I was convinced I hated pink back then, so I didn't bother. Now that I've had like 3 years to work out my conflicted feelings and my hair is dyed this color and it looks great with my skin tone (I am very pale), I wanted this. The color isn't quite what I was expecting, it's chalkier in person and the shimmer is barely visible in direct light, and it doesn't play well with my skin tone at all. The formula is gross and thick and somehow still patchy, even doing thin even coats I needed a third coat to cover spots that didn't cover completely and there was still VNL. It didn't dry right. I use Seche Vite, which never gives me problems, but I noticed a dent in one nail where it had pushed away from the edge and some of the polish peeled when I was cleaning up my cuticles.<br /><br />Overall, hard pass. Try OPI Frenchie from the new Grease collection instead, the swatches look really close and I hear the formula is good. Plus it's not sold out and marked up over 100% yet, so there's that too.\n",
      "9679->The power of peppermint! (And other natural stuff thats cool i guess) | 4 | 1 | I've had a beard for 3 years.  It's pretty thick and heavy and tends to grow in thickness/volume and not length.  It's more like a face afro, if you will.  Overall it's a pretty healthy beard but I decided to give Wild Willie's a shot since I like their beard butter so much.<br /><br />First off I when the bottle arrived i really thought they werr small.  So for $30 i wasnt sure if it was money well spent.  Time will tell.<br />Second I love the peppermint smell.  I don't feel it's overpowering at all and find it refreshing in the morning.  The shampoo lathers really well and a dime size goes a long way, even in my thick beard.  We do have soft water FYI, so that usually helps any soap/shampoo lathers better.  It feels like it cleans really well with out drying my beard out.<br /><br />The conditioner goes a long way as well. About a dime to penny size drop is all I need depending on how thick my beard has gotten.  I let the conditioner sit for about 5 minutes to let it really work in.  It leaves a nice cool tingling feeling on my face and has the great peppermint smell.  When I rinse it, it doesn't leave a heavy conditioner feel and rinses cleanly.<br /><br />Overall I think it does a good job.  It leaves my beard moisturized and not dried out and somewhat soft.  Definitely keeps my beard looking healthy and shiny.  In fact, while I actually get a lot of compliments on having a really great beard; once I started using these products I got so many more compliments. Now, that may just be a coincidence.<br /><br />Overall I'm so far satisfied.  Both shampoo and conditioner have lasted about a month with less than half used.  Both of which I use on a daily basis.\n",
      "9686->Get what ya pay for... | 2 | 1 | Looks nice. Easy to hold. Cheaply made. The bristles if the stiff bristled side began falling out after 1st use.<br />😞 The soft side is very soft, though.\n",
      "9689->I have tried others but sad to say they were not as rough as this ... | 4 | 1 | ★ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br />📌 UPDATE: 6/2/2016. I've had this product since January 13, 2016 and the beginning of this month the callus remover strip has start to break way. I would have updated earlier, but I forgot. I still use it and I still like it, but my 5 star has dropped to a 4 star because the longevity of the product. It probably should not be pulling away so soon. I keep it up right so it's not hitting any water after my shower.<br />-----<br />I have been so needing one of these. I have tried others but sad to say they were not as rough as this one and let me tell ya, I truly need a rough one. My feet are pretty dry. I love going for my pedicure's but the cost can add up. I would much rather just do it myself.<br /><br />So, needless to say, I got a chance to try this one out and I have to admit, it's &#34;great&#34; It's perfect for &#34;me&#34; I have a home pedicure system. I soaked my feet for thirty minutes then I took this wooden foot file and went to work on my super dry feet. WOW, it worked wonders.<br /><br />I was going to put a picture up, but I'm sure no one wants to see my callus feet with dead skin. That's just gross. As far as longevity, well, that's up to you. You can wash these with hot water, but after a while, you will need to throw it away and get a new one. As far a price does, I have seen this same size at a brand store for a few dollars less. But you will have to actually go to the store and buy it, when you can order right here on amazon<br /><br />❤️ PRO:<br />• it's large<br />• does good at removing tough dried skin<br /><br />💔 CONS:<br />• the suction does not hold<br /><br />✔️ Overall: It's a good callus remover. It works for me.\n",
      "9698->So far, so good | 5 | 1 | So far I love this water flosser! Im not sure how long it will last as it isn’t top quality (it isn’t the cheapest either), but it does amaze me how clean it gets between my teeth! This flosser does a much better job than threaded floss—much better!<br /> The only issue I do have is that the lightest setting still feels rather hard on my gums sometimes; however, I’ve never had a water flosser prior, so it could just be operators fault (me). I am getting used to how to operate it, making that a very little to almost nonexistent issue.<br /><br />As of two weeks into it, using it at least twice a day, I am really impressed and pleased!\n",
      "9712->It’s junk | 1 | 1 | The liquid soap doesn’t come out and if you push on the button it sinks in<br />Don’t like anything about it<br />Waste of money\n",
      "9713->Cancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion | 3 | 1 | Kale Leaf Extract (Brassica Oleracea Acephala) is the 14th ingredient listed out of 23 for the Cancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion. This lotion is made in Canada.<br /><br />The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin, but did leave behind a slightly tacky feel for about 5 minutes after application.<br /><br />It’s currently the middle of winter where I am, so I was able to see just how moisturizing the lotion is for me when I already had dry skin. The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is subtle, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it’s fine at first. But the scent lingers for several hours, and after that time, I’ve had enough of it.\n",
      "9722->WARNING!!! USELESS PUICE STONE. | 3 | 1 | Only good for washing 3/4 of your foot. The pumice stone for the heel is useless, because in order for you to scrub your heel properly, you need to lift the front of your foot pretty high to get the right angle, and the loop on the top prevents that. I wish it had bristles all the way to the heel instead of that useless pumice stone. I recommend buying one with ALL  bristles and NO pumice stone.<br />I hope you find this review helpful.\n",
      "9729->Small enough I can brush properly without a gag reflex but \"sonic\" takes getting used to. | 4 | 1 | Oh, my goodness, the size of the toothbrush head..... I can actually brush all of my teeth without triggering my gag reflex!<br /><br />That alone should get it five stars, but.....<br />Philips wasn't kidding about the &#34;Sonic&#34; part. That part will take quite a bit of getting used to.<br />And while I like that I can use mouthwash in the air flosser instead of limiting myself to water, sometimes I prefer a steady stream of liquid over the &#34;pulses&#34; this thing uses. I'll still use it on occasion, I just won't be getting rid of my Waterpik any time soon.\n",
      "9730->Ok. Soft, not a lot of shine on their own, they are ok | 4 | 1 | This hair has a very interesting texture.. it is soft to the touch, yet simultaneously has a rough texture. It is not like baby fine hair, it is like thick, slightly frizzy hair.<br /><br />There is not a whole lot of shine to this faux hair, although the flash on my camera added some.<br /><br />You get a generous six packages of hair. There is not a large amout of hair in each package, but it is long enough to be versatile.<br />Please note I do not wear this type of hair - I use them for craft purposes. I was happy with both the texture and the color of this batch.\n",
      "9731->reduces feeling of puffiness | 3 | 1 | I don't think there are any creams that would make eyebags disappear.  I just look for ones that would reduce the feeling of puffiness.  For that, I'd give this 5 stars.  But it does not reduce wrinkles, eyebags, etc., which is what it claims, so I gave it 3 stars.<br />I use it in the morning and in the evening, after washing my face.<br />It feels cool when applied, and doesn't cause any irritation.  It also doesn't give me eye crusts.  There is no smell.  It doesn't have any bad interaction with my makeup either.\n",
      "9741->Best price & product on Amazon. I researched and read reviews prior to ordering. | 5 | 1 | Best price and awesome product!<br /> Last year I started doing self lymphatic drainage on my face. These tools do a much better job than my fingers. After 10 minutes of using on my face while watching a move, I could feel intense drainage in my throat.<br />Ordering 3 more for my girlfriends for Valentines Day:)\n",
      "9742->BE CAREFUL WITH THIS PRODUCT | 1 | 1 | what the actual **** did I just put in my hair?<br />I had platinum blonde hair, almost white and I just used this for the first time because it's apparently supossed to add a hint of lilac hue to your hair. It turned DARK REDDISH BROWN almost immediately and I didn't even leave it in for 5 minutes and when I rinsed it my hair was a light brown colour! I immediately washed it using a clarifying shampoo and got most of it out thankfully but my hair is still stained a dark blonde almost orangey colour?? don't know if this bottle was old or what but this is absolutely not what is being advertised here and thank god i rinsed it as quickly as I did because it probably would have completely ruined my hair. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.\n",
      "9744->Picky toddler loves them | 5 | 1 | My son, who is an avowed beigetarian, loves these. So five stars for getting vegetable and legume into him without excess sugar even though I do not think they are delicious. Maybe someday he'll eat something that isn't a carb or space food but for now, we've got these.<br /><br />(the worst part is he will eat it up to the point that the wrapper is rolled down to, and then sort of suck on the end creating a rehydrated bean slurry).\n",
      "9756->NO NO NO | 1 | 1 | Don't buy these clips. They are not fully finished so all the edges on the entire clips 2 sides are super sharp like knives. They will break your hair people. They will cause breakage if used with rollers from the pressure of the sharp edges directly on your hair. They pull and catch terribly too. NO these are poor unfinished cheap trash.<br />What they send you looks nothing like the smooth ones in photos they show. They almost drew blood on my fingers.\n",
      "9763->Add to your hair curling collections | 4 | 1 | The bubble wand itself was a little short, I wish it was a little longer for those who has longer hair. This is really perfect for over the shoulder hair length. If you have longer hair, I suggest parting your hair into smaller section for better result.<br />The wand heats fast and I really appreciate that it has the rubber part towards the end so I could hold on to the wand while curling my hair. The wand is not heavy and it’s the perfect size to be carried around. The only draw back is that it only has one setting for heat level. Other than that, it came perfectly in a box.\n",
      "9769->Best trimmer yet, but one irritating flaw | 4 | 1 | So, I bought the lower model at Target without the vacuum earlier today and plugged it in, realizing that it didn't have enough power to do the deed, and the battery seemed pathetic.  It was a tough choice between the lesser model and the one with the vacuum/turbo.<br /><br />I exchanged the crappy one for this one and found its capabilities supersede my needs, and then some.  I could probably trim the hedges with this thing.  The vacuum is also very impressive.  I assumed I'd be sweeping half my body hair off the floor (yeah, \"bodyhair\" trimmers don't actually do what I want them to, so I use beard trimmers.  Most people that I know do, too).<br /><br />So, what's the drawback?  The setting doesn't stay put.  Unless you old it by the setting dial, it'll slip down with even the slightest pressure.  It's pathetic.  The box says something about setting \"lock\", but that's just a norelco company inside joke.\n",
      "9776->I tested a small splash on my hands and I really just didn't like the smell | 1 | 1 | No issues with shipping, packaging, etc. The product arrived new and in expected condition.<br />This product to me was very medicinal smelling and I just couldn't bring myself to use it. I tested a small splash on my hands and I really just didn't like the smell. I can see how others may like this product but smell is very subjective. Very glad it was inexpensive. I passed along this new bottle hoping a friend would like it more than I did. As a reference point I didn't like the Clubman Osage Rub scent either. It was different than the FL Water, but both to me were medicinal and I would rather go without aftershave than to use either product.\n",
      "9781->Great for thin hair! | 4 | 1 | As someone with thin hair, it is difficult for me to find styling tools that work for me without flattening the small amount of volume my hair will carry. I've done a video review so you can see this brush in action, but I find that this is an ideal brush for thin hair and people who hate to spend time doing their hair and generally prefer to walk out the door in a bun or ponytail. It took me about a minute to complete my full head of hair and look walk out the door ready.<br /><br />Pros to this straightening brush:<br />*cost effective<br />*easy to hold<br />*instructions are simple to read and easy to implement<br />*Works very well<br />*whole head ready to go in one minute<br />*fast heat up<br />*pretty in pink<br />*easy to read temperature gauge<br /><br />Cons:<br />*may pull some hair<br />*could scorch hair if hair is not completely dry when using<br />*easy to burn hands, be very careful<br />*over time may not be as hair friendly as other hair straightening brushes<br /><br />Overall, this is a great value and I plan to continue using it. If you have longer hair or thicker hair, you may want to consider a straightening brush with prongs that are more wide-set. For me, this was a great purchase.<br /><br />I purchased this hair straightener at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them. I am not a paid reviewer and I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. I gain nothing by giving this item a positive, negative or neutral review. If at any time in the future with prolonged use of any product my opinion changes, I will leave an update to my review of the product (as you can see by past reviews, that happens).\n",
      "9796->Do not buy | 1 | 1 | I installed this hair for a quick half up half down style for an event. Not ENTIRELY disappointed considering I knew this wouldn’t be the best hair for such a cheap price, but I didn’t expect it to mat and tangle after only a few hours.<br /><br />I installed this hair the night after I received it, we were taking a road trip the following morning so I had done nothing but sat in the car. The hair was matted and tangled after only a few hours in the car. No wind, no heat, just matted. It got extremely dry after day 3, EXTREMELY.<br /><br />I will say using argan oil helped with the dryness, left it shiny and easier to comb through. But left the hair oily after so many uses to the point it doesn’t hold a curl. Also, the ends are very very dry, I crimpped this hair and it will hold a crimp— everywhere BUT but ends. The ends will straightened and dried out within an hour or so.<br /><br />I said that to say lol i Definitely wouldn’t recommend the hair\n",
      "9804->Disappointed | 2 | 1 | I was excited about getting this.....This is the first time I've ever seen a wig in this poor of quality. Hair is noticeable as a wig with poor styled cut bangs and unattractive wig net spots majorly around different parts.<br />Wasted my money because there's no way I'll ever wear this.....very disappointed :(\n",

I will not be doing that anymore.<br /><br />After searching for a new scrub, I stumbled upon the Arabica Coffee Scrub and I am never turning back.<br /><br />This scrub does wonders to my skin (I do NOT use it on my face).<br /><br />It leaves my body refreshed and smooth after one use.<br /><br />I have not had a problem with rashes, or breakouts (I have extremely sensitive skin and break out easily).<br /><br />The scrub smells like coffee (obviously), but it also has a sweet smell that flows with it.<br /><br />It is a scrub, so it is rough (Don't rub it into your skin relentlessly).\n",

Baby headbands are so expensive and I don't want to make my own. I'm delighted to have found these! I was given these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. All views expressed are 100% mine and 100% honest. Thanks for reading and I hope my review helps you.\n",

      "9850->Cakey, pink, and way too dark. | 1 | 1 | Firstly, this is not what “Ivory” looks like. It’s waaaay too dark, and has a very obvious pink undertone. The formula is super cakey, and it pills up immediately as you apply which is the most weird thing I’ve ever seen a foundation do.<br /><br />Only getting one star because the finish is nice. This doesn’t change a thing though, since the foundation is unuseable.<br /><br />I also can’t return it so COOL. Many thanks.\n",
      "9859->Quick and easy facial cleaning in no time | 5 | 1 | Fantastic facial cleaning brush.  I like that it has a pretty case to use if I ever travel with it.  You can store the other brushes (comes with 3.  One for massage, one for sensitive skin and one normal brush)<br />Great that the battery holds a charge for about 30 uses.  Nice feature for when I'm on the road and don't want to bother with the charger at every hotel.<br />Has 3 speeds so you can decide on how much brushing you want on your face.<br />My face feels so clean after I'm done using it.  I put on some night cream, with the massage brush, afterwards and my face is so smooth.  I love it.<br />I'm also wondering how difficult it will be to find replacement brush heads.\n",
      "9865->Cute, but slip | 3 | 1 | Crazy cute headbands; they don't stay in place well, though.  Made of nylon, swimsuit-like, material.<br />Would be a little better if they had nonslip elastic on the inside\n",

      "9879->Very light, very pleasant | 5 | 1 | Definitely a clean fragrance that's fine for anyone.<br />To me, the scent is pettigrain, orange blossoms.<br />As you would expect, it doesn't have a lot of longevity. But after application it's quite uplifting. Not overpowering.<br />Absolutely suitable for babies and toddlers, as well as teens and moms.\n",
      "9890->Nice starter lashes | 3 | 1 | These accent lashes are easier to apply than full strips, but they do take some practice. I bought these because they had an applicator, but it doesn't work. The lashes stick to the applicator and don't let go of it. I had to google another way to apply them, and that works pretty well.<br /><br />I need mascara on my lashes, or the magnetics slip right off. Then I put on the bottom lash and close my eye to hold it in place. After that, I quickly drop the top lash into place. It took a lot of patience and practice to get it. Don't try to use them right before you are going out--practice first when you aren't rushed.<br /><br />Once the lashes are on, I can feel them and sometimes see them when I squint. The feeling goes away the longer they are on. They do look great, though, and I will try full lashes later.\n",

      "9899->A fairly basic 'stache wax with good hold and tackiness | 4 | 1 | I'm the proud owner of a rather glorious handlebar moustache (though I say so myself). So when a 'stache wax or grooming product comes available on Vine I'll usually request it if it's anything in the neighborhood of what I usually like.<br /><br />I like firm or strong hold waxes with significant tackiness. I won't even consider a wax unless it either states a strong hold or a tacky hold or both. As a reference my other favorite common varieties of moustache wax include (in order of preference descending):<br />Firehouse Moustache Wax - Tacky (Wacky Tacky)<br />The Vintage Grooming Company - Death Grip<br />Can You Handlebar - Primary<br /><br />All of these are either exceptionally tacky or very strong in hold or both. I have tried many other waxes by various brands over the last several years but the ones above are my favorites and the ones that I feel are most worth mentioning in comparison to this product.<br /><br />I would rate this wax as slightly less tacky than the Firehouse Moustache wax Tacky and slightly less stiffness than the Can You Handlebar Primary wax. Death Grip has it's own unique and weird properties (and I don't love the way it smells) so it is hard to direct compare :-)<br /><br />As far as my general ranking I'd put this solidly in the top 5 waxes I've ever tried though, probably just under the three above and maaaybe 5th place after maybe Fisticuffs Strong Hold (which also has some pine resin for stickiness).<br /><br />Unscented is good! Nothing worse than a cloying scent right up under your nose holes all day long!<br /><br />Anyway, it has a strong hold for shaping if you like a strong curl as I do, combined with a tacky hold if you get a lot of stray and fly away hairs as I do. While my \"go to\" product is still Firehouse Tacky, and this has not replaced that, this is a worthy offering. The tree embossment on the wax is cute and I kinda dig that they give you the recipe.<br /><br />The price point at the time of this writing is very fair. If you're in need of a good strong hold tacky wax I'd say give this product a shot!\n",
      "9906->smells nice | 5 | 1 | I want to use this spray on the bedding.  All the bedding.  Makes it smell so nice for when we all go to bed.  Just a nice fresh scent.<br />I can't really pick out a particular scent with this spray.  It's a nice combination though.<br />With spring here and the windows open again, we're all loving having a nice fresh scent in our bedrooms and our beds using this spray.\n",
      "9911->Terrible sticker that couldn't hardly get off the bottom | 1 | 1 | Why would any company put a sticker that almost covered the whole bottom of the pan on there?<br />There is still residual glue stuff on it...am I supposed to burn it off?\n",
      "9916->Edited previous review after opening every bottle | 2 | 1 | After reading the reviews for this product I, was nervous that  The nail polish was going to arrive and not be actual miracle gel products. All six bottles arrived perfectly intact and valid sally Hansen miracle gel polishes. The colors are fun and I absolutely love them, I’ve changed the color quickly. I recommend this variety pack for anyone who loves multi colored nails and wants to have a clean and polish look.<br />** EDITED after opening opening each bottle\" Brushes are falling apart, I'm talking the bristles were falling out as I was painting my nails. Brushes were 1/2 gone, yellow color was really cute, but wen opened only 1/2 a brush was intact.....and then more fell out.

Oh and if you let the mix sit for 15 minutes before applying, the color will develop faster on your skin.\n",
      "9939->Many 2\" stencils, color doesn't apply well | 3 | 1 | It comes with 24 different stencils (you'll have to flip the same stencil over for left/right eyebrows), which are for eyebrows that are a little over 2 inches in length.  I tried a few that are close to my eyebrow shape and thickness (or thinness), but my eyebrows are a little too weird and short.<br />It took quite a bit of effort to transfer the color from the tube to my brows/skin.  The end result is okay.<br />It comes with a double ended brush to help with applying and fixing the color and shape, so that helps.\n",

      "9946->Just the perfect size & weight for my purse | 5 | 1 | Evolve Boar Bristle Purse Size Brush<br />  I needed a new brush for my purse & now I have one!  Just the perfect size & weight for my purse.  Lightweight yet sturdy.  No plastic!  This brush would also be perfect for a toddler's hair or an elderly person's thin hair. No sharp edges to poke you!<br />  I have never had a boar's hair brush so I suppose there is a bald boar running around somewhere!  Not in my neighborhood, I hope!!<br />  I just hope I don't lose this brush!  I have a hard time keeping brushes.  Usually, I lose them.  Sometimes my cat decides he likes my brush, so I give in.  He needs to stay out of my purse!<br />  I'm hoping this brush works out.  Then I will graduate up to the larger sizes.  I think the plastic brushes are rough on my hair & pull some hair out.<br />  So far, I'm loving this brush.  It really smooths & tames my hair down  If you want a natural soft brush, this is the one for you.  I don't use this brush on wet hair.  I switched over to a wide tooth comb.  My plastic brushes are in the trash!!<br />  I did receive this brush at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I love it!  Thank You!!\n",
      "9952->Deep cleaning | 5 | 1 | This is perfect for me!  I was using sponges and brushes but, one needs to be replaced every couple of months and the other needs batteries replaced.  This wash cloth is exfoliating and soft at the same time.  I have combination skin and this pad is great for my skin.  If you need a gentler wash just lighten you pressure and if you need a good scrub just at more pressure.  I throw the pad in the wash with my towels each week so, it is easily kept clean.  Also, it has a hook so, I hang it up to dry after each use.  Great product that is just so simple and easy to use.<br />Sample provided for review\n",
      "9954->Very agressive peel off mask which took skin with it. | 1 | 1 | Never has a peel off mask removed a layer of skin.<br />Be very careful.<br />I’m always able to use them to this area which is the high cheek not the under eye.<br />Never any issues before with other products but for some reason this one it was.\n",
      "9956->Very pretty | 5 | 1 | Whoever designed these hair clips knows that little girls LOVE unicorns. The sequins on one clip project a gold-fuchsia vibe while the other is magenta, gold and blue.<br />The wings and star are glued on and I can see these coming off in time but hey I've got a glue gun. The front of strong clips (the bit you see) are covered in the dusky pink grosgrain ribbon, and the endings look neat and tidy. These are a big hit with a 6 year old\n",
      "9959->Solid product for the cost | 4 | 1 | Wish the instructions were a little more clear. Product feels to be good quality, works great. Tank capacity is pretty minimal but I guess you'd expect that from something that is classified for travel.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase.\n",
      "9975->Where do you get refills | 2 | 1 | I love this tooth brush but where do you get refills.  I can not find them anywhere and they are so expensive.  they cost more then the tooth brush alone.  so if anyone has an idea please let me know<br />jongale64@comast.net\n",
      "9980->Not the perfect hair dryer for me | 4 | 1 | I wanted this to be the perfect dryer for me b/c it has a longer lasting AC motor compared to the typical DC motor. But after a few uses I decided to return it.<br /><br />Pros: 3 heat settings, 2 speeds settings, cool button, removable filter, included diffuser for drying my curly hair<br /><br />Cons - too heavy for regular use, dries slower than Revlon 1875\n",
      "9981->I really hope the company sees this review | 2 | 1 | I think they switched the formula. I used carols daughters early last year in 2020 and it was amazing and it smelled nice. However, I had to stop buying their products bc of the strong chemical-like smell that's being masked by overwhelming perfume.<br /><br />I was so disappointed because I bought a whole bottle and was in the middle of doing my hair and I could not bring myself to even use it for the sake of my wash day routine.... I believe the other reviews when they say it smells bad.\n",
      "9990->These work great! | 5 | 1 | These Daletu Nail Tip Clips work great. I put on the nail and then clipped it to my finger. It helped the nail stay in place while it dried. I think they will be good for other crafty things too.<br /><br />The clips are clear and they are not too tight on the fingers. They come individually packaged. Because they are clear it helps to get the clip in the correct place on the nail.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Daletu Nail Tip Clips to family and friends.\n",
      "9992->Smell when it gets wet and causes itchy scalp | 2 | 1 | I had to take it out after 2 weeks.. This is NOT a good hair...it smelled so bad after it gets wet i could not take it.. it smells like mildew and urine ..and it caused itchy scalp..I will go back to antibacterial prestretched hair.. it hold up much better and does not cause itching and horrible smell..<br />I would not recommend and wont buy again..\n",
      "10000->Best sleep mask I have ever used, with a flaw. | 4 | 1 | One star off because it is hard to adjust small enough for my admittedly somewhat smaller head and the elastic stretches out quickly. The velcro barely overlaps on me, just enough to hold when the mask is new, but within a short time, the elastic stretches out and I can no longer get a snug fit. An extra inch of velcro would solve this deficiency. For the price, around $6-7 each, replacing them frequently is affordable, but it is wasteful. They are otherwise well-designed and well-made. They even hold up well to a gentle hand-washing.<br /><br />Update August 2017: Still happy enough with these masks, but the last batch I received don't block out light as completely as I remember my previous masks doing. They look the same, but I'm wondering if there's been a change to the filler material. One of these days I will open one of the old ones and see if it used to be filled with black floss, or have an extra layer or something else that made it block light better.\n",
      "10011->Nothing like my chiropractors device. | 3 | 0 | I use it for extreme muscle tension or pinched nerves.  Of course I need help reaching where it hurts the most.<br />Not too bad in places I can reach.<br />Worth the money?? Ehh, for me, not really. But I also have other devices and a husband to calm my muscle tension.<br />It’s great in a pinch while I’m at work.\n",
      "10013->TOTAL RIP OFF . THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE | 1 | 0 | False advertising. There’s nothing NANO about these. The tips are HUGE. They’re 3 to 4 times the size of Bella Donna hair tips. I contacted the seller to ask about how to install and about the beads and was treated so badly I don’t think they should be allowed to sell on Amazon. I’m not kidding when I say I had to send 20 emails back n forth and I never got a straight answer. They said they know nothing about any beads. That’s a quote! I said, well then how do you install? I kept getting the run around. Finally I pointed out they had photos of beads actually on the listing and then they claimed they had a new employee that accidentally put those photos up. They finally admitted you need beads to install and said they would send me some but I never got them. They lied of course. The beads from Bella Donna are too small. All beads on Amazon are too small. I have no idea what to do with these. They strung me along for so long saying “the beads are in the mail”, I can’t return them. so I decided to make a YouTube video for you all! The good reviews must be fake on here. Because I can’t figure out how to install and they won’t help. I mean how do they stay in business? If I was happy I would return again and buy more.  I work in the fashion business! I bought these for a photo shoot so I was looking for cheap. I don’t expect top of the line for the price I paid. But I expect polite helpful people who don’t insult me and I expect help telling me how to install them. That’s not asking too much!<br />Now let’s talk about the “hair”. I’m going to make a video review of this hair they claim is 100% real VIRGIN , but it says not to bleach it. It’s also so straight it looks and feels like doll hair. Why can’t you bleach it if it’s real virgin remy hair??! I have learned about how to test hair to prove on camera if it’s real hair. If you don’t care that it’s real hair then it is pretty. It is very soft and pretty color but it’s unnaturally stick straight and the tips are massively huge. Like a cigarette size.  Thick n huge with wire loops on the end that you can not cut all of the way out. Why????<br />Why not include , with the hair , CLEAR instructions on how to install? This has NO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL. No beads and you can not buy beads large enough to fit the ends. I think the reason they do not admit the beads is to avoid telling the size of the bead we need because then we would realize how big they are. If you want cigarettes in your hair then maybe you’ll be happy.  It looks weird even in photos. Because I wanted these just for photos they didn’t have to be great. But these are a Total RIP OFF.\n",

      "10035->Overpriced, not worth it | 2 | 0 | I was really looking forward to my first 'fancy' face mask. As someone that primarily buys $1-2 sheet masks, this was supposed to feel luxe. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the product for several reasons. It's difficult to adhere for long periods of time and mine kept falling off several times before getting it to stick. This was annoying and pretty gross since my hands were basically all over the mask.<br /><br />It has a nice cooling effect but I can't see paying $6 for this mask when cheaper ones easily are as good. There are other brands more worth your time and money.\n",

      "10065->Good razor for the price | 4 | 0 | This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra. However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.<br />I like the corded feature because there is no battery to wear out over time. Of course, the razor is lighter than the Quadra because there is no battery, and it tends to make a bit of a shrill sound from time to time.<br />Overall, though I like it and would likely buy another when this one wears out.\n",
      "10067->Cute set of lipsticks, makes a great gift too | 4 | 0 | This set of lipsticks is such a gimmick but man I really like them. They are meant to look like a box of cigarettes and the 4 lipsticks are actually pretty small, also meant to look like little cigarettes. This set of 4 will run you about $10 which is not a bad deal to be honest.<br /><br />The little bullet style lipsticks all have very similar tones to be honest but are just different enough that you can distinguish them. They are very easy to apply and you can get a nice pointy application with them which is great. They are surprisingly smooth and creamy and have a good taste to them. They have a pretty good staying power, again it was a bit surprising to be honest. They wear not bad in the waterproof department but did wear off a bit on cups and mugs.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed by these and think these would make for a great little gag gift, especially for young adults dabbling into makeup but also for others as well that are looking for a lipstick that goes well into the purse and gives them options.\n",
      "10078->Nice color but arrived broken | 3 | 0 | Unfortunately, this lipstick arrived broken. It was cracked in the middle and stuck to the bottom. It seemed like it had been that way for a while, not just broken in transit.<br /><br />I was able to get it out and stick it in the correct side. It’s not secure, but it will do. I definitely can’t take it in my purse for use out and about as I have to pull it out with my fingers each time.<br /><br />The color of the product is nice. The lipstick has good color and is also buildable. I found this particular shade flattering and delicate enough for someone who mostly wears neutrals.<br /><br />I wasn’t a big fan of the pointed shape of the product. I’m getting used to it, but just not convinced it makes application more precise than a round one.<br /><br />The longevity of the lipstick was OK. It definitely didn’t stay after eating or drinking - this is the kind of product you have to reapply every couple hours.  It’s creamy enough but I wouldn’t say super moisturizing.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn’t impressed by this product. I liked the color and texture, but the packaging, shape, and longevity were all nos for me.\n",
      "10087->It's ok... | 3 | 0 | Everything is very lightweight, which is nice, but the toothbrushes are so light that they tip over VERY easily. Also, unlike other typical toothbrushes, there is no flexibility to them. After repeated use (and rinsing), the handle just doesn't feel as clean and comfortable to me.<br /><br />No tray was included (as the product picture shows), but that's fine. I wouldn't be keeping my toothbrush with an exfoliating pad anyway. Would have enjoyed the exfoliating brush more if the handle loop had just a little more space to allow me to fit my hand through it to hold the brush properly.<br /><br />The comb has very wide teeth, which is good for long, thick hair just after washing. But if you don't have long, thick hair... it's pretty much useless. Would've been nice if the handle of the comb had a notch or a groove to allow for a better grip.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying this as a gift for someone... don't. Unless it's for a child/teen. There are too many other better sets out there.\n",

      "10164->But is it right for YOU??? | 5 | 0 | It really IS like a mild Botox treatment!<br />Ummm, I may or may not know that from personal experience, haha!<br />Okay, yes, I know it from personal experience.<br />As a little background, paracress has been long used as an anti-inflammatory and numbing herb, it's even called the toothache herb.<br />It also 'numbs', as in relaxes, the skin.<br />Guess what, that's exactly how Botox works.<br />While it isn't going to have nearly the same dramatic effect, I found it to be enough of the difference to where this is always going to be in my makeup/skincare bag.<br />Clinical trials using it in this way have indicated that it works on all but about 25% of the participants, so there's a chance it might not work for you. I'm thrilled to be in the percent that it did.<br />It has some of the same chemical components as Szechuan pepper, which has got to be safer than the botulism in Botox, right?<br /><br />Paracress is almost unheard of outside of Brazil. This will be our little secret!<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s. I've always taken care of my skin and stayed out of the sun, so I probably have fewer wrinkles than most people my age, but trust me, I've got them.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to make the rather substantial investments in this product. It's definitely a risk since it doesn't work for everyone. And I can't stress enough that it's not going to be super dramatic change. But heck, I'm excited at even small changes.<br /><br />xxoo\n",
      "10218->Beautiful green bottles leaked! | 3 | 0 | Bottles do leaked when shaken. Putting a rubber band at the neck of the bottle did not improve much. So if you must shake the bottle, shake it sideways.<br />Nice fine mist.<br /><br />Update:<br />Added one star. Company reps Elena & Lisa contacted us, gist of their msg was they need positive reviews for a successful business. We absolutely agree ! And they mentioned they are seeking a manufacturing plant that gives quality bottles (not their words but the thoughts conveyed) They also offered a refund which we haven’t received. It woulda been much more effective had they fix the problem and sent no leak bottles for a positive review. In any case, it’s still usable. And keep in mind... you will read about leaking bottles from other vendors too!! Go ahead and purchase if their price is right. And if there are problems, return them.\n",

      "10225->Great for your legs! | 4 | 0 | They say the cure for cancer will be found in the sea. I've long been a fan of Dead Sea Mineral products so I was excited when LeliaSea sent me a sample to try and test as a consumer for the purpose of this review. Here's my opinion:<br /><br />It's packaged quite nicely. I don't detect much of a scent at all which is nice so it won't compete with my fragrances. However, I think it's quite small for a body lotion. It's the size of a hand cream. So given it's size, I feel like it's a bit pricey but it is a nice lotion. It soaks in quickly to dry skin and is highly moisturizing. It works well on my legs but on my hands it feels a little greasy. It's best to use on the driest parts of your body. Overall, I think it's a great lotion for extremely dry skin.\n",
      "10261->Has a spicy aroma; leaves my hair nourished and enhanced my curls (see update) | 2 | 0 | This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.\n",

      "10317->Great for mixing oil blends for rollerballs | 5 | 0 | I use fractioned oils to make rollerballs for my oil blends and for a carrier for various topical uses.<br />I have been wanting to recreate a muscle cramp relief oil from a major essential oil club and lucked up with a copycat recipe.  These oils are over $30 for 5ml and, while it works great and smells amazing, I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that knowing that I have a box full of single oils.<br />When I saw this bottle with the pump, I knew it was time to try my hand and mixing this recipe.  I had a few other rollerballs that I wanted to make (some decongestant and immune boosters since it’s getting to that time of year) so I inserted the pump and got to work.  The oils mixed VERY well and the pump on the bottle made it very easy to dispense just enough into the small rollerball opening.  That is SUCH a nice feature – manufacturer, please don’t remove that from the item.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it’s thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I’m soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby’s back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).  I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to use fractioned oil for their essential oil uses.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered. I have not been paid to leave a review but simply received a discount to test the product for flaws or issues.  This review is of my own words and using my firsthand experience with the product.

Oz. / 85 ml - Inspired By Pink Friday By Nicki Minaj Perfume]]<br /><br />I have been trying several different parfums and body sprays to help me find a new fresh scent or to come up with my own signature scent by combining two or three scents or wearing one scent alone. The seller does a fabulous job of packaging and delivering quickly. The parfum is very pretty in it's design in a feminine bottle with a curved feminine design that's cute on my dresser or vanity. I like this parfum. It has a sort of delicious smelling fruity scent that is very inviting, but you can also smell musk and a slight hint of sweet floral undertones like jasmine. The scent is nice and soft and doesn't bother or irritate my senses. The scent is not overpowering. It's super difficult to explain how scents smell but all I can say is it really does smell fantastic and it does stay on for a pretty good while. I like how the scent sort of softens and mellows when I wear it a while. It lasts a lot longer if I spray it on my wrist and other pulse points and lingers in the air. I definitely like this parfum and would absolutely say try it for yourself. It's a pretty sensual scent and my finance likes it. This is a 2.9 ounce bottle at under 11.00 delivered to your door. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received will not alter my honest opinion in any way. Since I count on honest product reviews to make my selections on Amazon, I will always be forthcoming and sincere in all my reviews. No matter if the product is discounted or not, I will leave honest feedback that I base on my own personal experience with the product I receive. I am in no way affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods. *One last note, I wasn't sure what the difference in Eau De Parfum and Perfume is, so I looked it up. Here's what I found on the web on perfume website: Eau de parfum. &#34;After the top notes have died away, the middle notes or heart notes of a perfume become noticeable. This is the focus of eau de parfum which makes it perfect to spray on hair or clothing. (Be careful with delicate fabrics such as silk, though, as they may stain.) The concentration of oils is over 15%, sometimes reaching as high as 20%. Since it is less intense than perfume extract, it is also cheaper, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes.&#34; So it is stronger than Eau de Cologne which contains about 7% essence dissolved in alcohol of 60º or 70º, and stronger than Eau de toilette which contains around 10% aromatic essence. But not as strong as Perfume. This is the strongest of scents because of the higher concentration of essences – as much as 40% by volume.\n",

The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a great product to you use for your hair. When dry my hair is still very manageable and looks great. I really like this a lot and what it does to my hair.\n",
      "10445->Really Hard to Put on | 3 | 0 | I don't have anything bad to say about this manufacturer. I was really excited to try magnetic lashes, but girl, these are impossible to put on! I even watched a YouTube video of someone teaching you how to put these on and even she couldn't get them on! I tried another brand that comes with a little applicator type thing and that didn't work either.<br /><br />The idea is amazing. There are two magnetic light lashes. One goes on top of your eyelashes and the other one below. Then the magnets snap together to hold to your lashes.  Sounds amazing, but I had to give up before I got crazy frustrated.\n",
      "10455->Nice set | 5 | 0 | These looked very pretty in my daughter’s hair. They really stood out. They looked just like the picture. They went in and out easily. They stayed in fairly well. They were very pretty. She liked them a lot. They really made her look nice. They would also look nice for pictures. The quality was pretty decent. It is nice that it is a set and you get a bunch. I liked the variety. I was happy and would recommend it.<br />They also helped keep her hair out of her face.\n",

      "10466->not easy to get my feet into | 2 | 0 | I'm diabetic and need something to soak my feet I daily. I like the wheels since it hard for me to carry things, I also like the handle to pull it with and the drainage hose. It feels like the water gets too hot. the massage rollers should have at least 2 settings gentle and MORE. There is no spot for EPSOM SALTS. The best part was the rain shower.<br />For me the water was too hot, the rollers were too rough, the edge where your legs rest is rough and scratched the back of my legs. I would have returned but the packaging was destroyed\n",
      "10467->Not what I expected | 3 | 0 | The elastic band that holds make up brushes has been sewed upside down.<br />Production pictures show biggest bursh can fit right side of holder and smallest of left.<br />What I received is misdirected.<br /><br />The holder is waterproof, easy to wipe and hold my make up brushes.<br />But it's very thin and flat that when I close it, it smushes my brushes and I don't want to keep them in that position.<br />I just keep my small brushes in and not the big brushes.\n",
      "10477->Large pads | 4 | 0 | I don’t usually use makeup remover pads, just a cleanser with my facial brush and a wash cloth to rinse. However, I find these pads easy to use and a quick solution when I am tired or in a hurry. The pads are extra large and easily clean my entire face. One side is for cleaning or removing make up and then the other side is for wiping the face.<br /><br />The pads are in a large jar with plenty of liquid. The lid fits tight so I can flip the jar over to make sure they are always wet.\n",
      "10486->Love it, oriental scent that is very similar to LouLou | 5 | 0 | This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.\n",

      "10516->Not as user friendly as I’d hoped. | 3 | 0 | These are ok, not great not bad but ok.<br /><br />They hold static so any glitter pieces you put in them are hard to put back.<br /><br />They’re small too & a bit hard to manage but for the price, I figure it was fair.\n",
      "10552->Not a Fan | 3 | 0 | I have super curly hair and need a smoothing shampoo and conditioner. I was disappointed in the size of the products. I only got to use it one time since I have a lot of hair.<br />I also didn’t like that it weighed my hair down.\n",
      "10555->Mmmmm Im not sure... | 2 | 0 | I was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any árgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won’t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.\n",
      "10561->Not as easy to use in my own hair in the beginning. | 5 | 0 | These Braided Hair Clips are nice. I used them in my own hair, and I did have a bit of difficulty in the beginning. I practiced on a mannequin’s hair and was able to use them easily.<br /><br />The pack comes with 4 hair clips. The clips have one big clip on the bottom and three smaller clips on the top. The small clips have little crystals in a flower shape. Each clip has different color combinations for the crystals. Each clip has a spring mechanism for the opening.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Braided Hair Clips to family and friends.\n",
      "10564->3.5 stars; awful flavor and smell, 4 coats gets a good opaque color | 4 | 0 | There’s such a strong, sweet, artificial vanilla flavor and smell to this that is cloying and sickening. Yuck. I hate it.<br />Once it sets (about 2-5 minutes, which is longer than most), it looks matte and stays in place very well. It took 4 layers to look fully black on me.<br />Would be 4 stars if it didn’t taste and smell horrible. 3.5 stars\n",
      "10568->Works like advertised. | 4 | 0 | Works great for traveling and having in office. I use mine with rubbing alcohol instead of using hand sanitizers all the time.  My only complaint is it's hard to find where the spray comes out.  It blends in and is hard to see.  I usually feel for it.<br />It also doesn't come with a little funnel for filling.  I had one already so wasn't a problem for me.  But hard to fill without a funnel.\n",
      "10576->Korean Beauty Product Filled with \"Pearls\" | 4 | 0 | I've never heard of this brand before but the price is high and it's considered a premium beauty product, made in Korea. The question is, it is worth the price?<br /><br />First, kudos to the packaging. The Glam Pearl Radiance Capsule serum is full of pearls (whether they are real or not is unclear). The bottle is filled with tiny \"pearls\" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br /><br />Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all. I've been using it only a few weeks and will update my review if I see any significant change to my face. As it is, it's a pricey but aesthetically pleasing beauty product that will make you feel like you will get a pearl-like beauty just by using it.\n",
      "10578->Moisturizes, Comforts, Some Color Correction-Emphasizes My Pores, Need An Ingredient List | 3 | 0 | JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in Korea.\n",
      "10595->Dotting works great, the brushes less so | 3 | 0 | I've been wanting these on and off for a few years now, but it always seemed like a silly extra thing. After all, painting my nails is already an indulgent activity. Why do I need extra tools for that?<br /><br />Because these make it so much easier to make cute designs on your nails! Want flowers? 6 quick white dots and you're done. Want a heart? Do two quick dots and pull them down to connect. You don't need any artistic ability to create cute designs while using the dotting side of these tools. Which is perfect, because I definitely cannot draw with my non-dominant hand.<br /><br />So why the middle of the road rating? Because the other side of these tools, the brushes, aren't nearly as easy to use. They're thin and stuff by design, so that you can use them to draw designs on your nail. But somehow, the stiffness seems to work against you. It resists pressure, which is great, bit can be hard to make the kind of brushstrokes you want. That makes it much more difficult to draw with.<br /><br />I still recommend these, if only for the dotting side of the tools!\n",
      "10596->Too dramatic | 3 | 0 | This might come down to personal preference but these lashes are just too dramatic for me. The quality is nice and the lashes have a good feathery quality but the length of them exceeds my eyebrows. It would be great for costumes but not for weddings or special events.<br /><br />The lashes tickle my eyebrows are a and honestly remind me of a spider. I'm sure some love this type of look but it's not for me. If it were shorter I would be a good dramatic lash.\n",
      "10608->Strong scent that stays with you - and yes, you can feel the scent | 3 | 0 | The scent you can feel? I wasn't certain what that could mean, but now that I've used it, I get it. I dont know if it's the caffeine or the tea tree oil... or maybe its eucalyptus, but it does have a tingling effect on your skin. And that tingling effect is not just some slight effect, its noticable. In fact, certain times (and xertain areas of skin), it's almost too much. As such, I dont use this daily.<br /><br />As for scent - it is a strong but pleasant scent that smells like it feels... and again, it strikes me as a bit strong. I have some Beast \"Blue\" beard oil that has the same scent. It cleans nicely and the scent stays with you as you go about your day.\n",
      "10637->Worst brand on the market | 2 | 0 | I bought several brands of Magnetic Eyelashes and liners: Newcally, Yiwamica, CARETHYS, Coolours, and LAMIX. This one, CARATHYS was the worst. The eyelashes looked \"unkempt\" compared to the others and less natural because the fibers were double layered. The magnets on the back were such poor quality! They had weak magnetic power (compared to Newcally, LAMIX, and Coolours but same as Yiwamica) and they were glued on haphazardly. The spacing was uneven and they were all crooked. Yiwamica had magnet issues too, where the magnets were weak and some even fell off, but at least those lashes looked more natural. This brand was the worst.<br /><br />Two pros:<br />--Lashes fibers were thinner so looked more natural compared to the better quality brands and slightly less black<br />--The liner wasn't too bad. The consistency was actually pretty good, neither goopy nor too liquid, but the lash magnets are bad so not going to keep just for the liner!<br /><br />I would recommend Newcally for the best quality (but least natural). LAMIX and Coolours are also good choices.\n",
      "10653->Great eyelash kit !!! | 5 | 0 | Pros:<br />Lashes look great<br />Easy to apply<br />Stayed on the whole day<br />Reusable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !!!\n",
      "10697->Cute - works OK - doesn’t get too warm…No directions | 3 | 0 | This eye massage thing doesn’t come with any directions. Now it’s not rocket science but I would like to know if there’s supposed to be heat in each function - if it supposed to pulse on the blue and the red light etc. I say this because I think there’s only heat when the red light is on. The rest seem to have no heat.  And it is very light - very slight heat as it is. It makes me question is there even heat or has my face heated the crystal up. So I was really expecting it to have much more heat. Also with both the red and the blue light it’s not a constant vibration - it’s kind of like a pulse vibration it goes on and it goes off then it goes on and it goes off.<br /><br />I do like that you can use it without the red or the blue light because the third setting is just a vibration - and that one is a constant vibration. But again that setting seems to have no heat at all.<br /><br />The crystal does seem to be some kind of quartz. It is a clear type of crystal so I assume it’s quartz because quartz is pretty common.<br /><br />It feels pretty nice around my eyes and if you hold it a certain way the red and/or or blue light will not get into your eye - you won’t see it while you use it. And I do like that. So this is OK and it looks just like a tube of lipstick.\n",

      "10712->Pretty but pricey for 3! | 4 | 0 | These are really pretty & even more than others I have purchased, I like them! They seem well made but one of them is lined up differently and I'd like to take it off and re-glue it so they are all facing the same way.<br />All in all, they really are pretty!  :)\n",
      "10717->Returned product- very disappointed! | 1 | 0 | I returned these- first of all, they are mini sized. Secondly, they didn’t hold my bun up like the larger sized Conair brand did. Thirdly, when I take them out, they catch my hair and pull it really hard. It’s so difficult to get out without pain. I even tried them on my friend to see if my hair was too thick/curly, and they did the same on her hair, which is thinner than mine.<br /><br />Save your money.\n",
      "10718->Works quite well | 4 | 0 | Review for: PRESKBOO Facial Hair Remover for Women,Painless Hair Remover Shaver for Face,Nose Ear Trimmer<br /><br />This small hair remover works quite well. It is also small enough to keep in a bag or back pack. It comes with a cover over the top so it looks like a lipstick tube at first glance.<br /><br />The shaver requires 1 AA battery that is not included. It is easy to change out the battery just by pulling the base off. There is an on/off button that slides and is easy to access.<br /><br />I am happy with the closeness of the shave. It also does not leave my face feeling all tingly like some shavers do. Because the head is small, I can use it close to my eye brows to catch any excess hair. There is a tiny head included for nose or ear hairs.\n",
      "10732->Nice exfoliating bar! | 4 | 0 | Finally got around to using this bar and I'm glad I did.  It's kind of a small bar, but it's not super lathery, so I suspect will last a while.<br /><br />It's most definitely an exfoliating bar, so use it with some care or you might scuff your skin up a bit.<br /><br />I like the aroma and exfoliation.  I would definitely buy this one again.\n",
      "10747->Ok powder, not worth the long wait on shipping | 3 | 0 | Let’s see. I was looking for a nice, inexpensive mint green pallet. It’s hard to find a genuine mint green. No one had left a review of this, so I decided to take a chance. First of all, the shipping took forever. I ordered this April 25, and I didn’t receive it until May 22, almost a month later. I’ve received things faster ordering them from China! Then, once I got it, I tried it out (see pics). The colors are nice, but not extremely impressive. The matte colors are very powdery and get all over your face. The shimmers are nice. I usually dust my eyes with powder, after I apply eyeshadow, to set it, and then apply more shadow, if I need it. I lightly dusted loose powder in my eyes, after application, and I dust very gently. Most of the shadow came off. So I reapplied. The color was nice, but the matte shades faded a lot, after two hours. The shimmer stayed, but the pigment wasn’t as strong, after a few hours.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor. Buy a mint green palette from a store where you can get it faster, and where the color payoff is better.\n",
      "10766->Shiny hair but not very desirable with packaging | 3 | 0 | Sometimes when I am not in the right mood, I change my hairstyle to feel better. After a bit of searching on Amazon, I found this amber hair that was very beautiful in the picture. When I received the product, it did not look and feel good. But it was easy to install and use. I think the quality of the product is a little different from what the picture shows. But in terms of shine, the hair is of good quality. I have always wanted my hair to fall on my shoulders, and this hair is exactly what I was looking for.<br />If I want to summarize:<br />- Improper packaging<br />+ Good hair length<br />+ Easy installation\n",

My frontal / closure is nowhere near 14 inches and the bundles even though I have not unravel them appear to be thin. Review again in 2 weeks.<br />Ohk.. Took it out right at 2weeks..

      "10822->A good human hair wig! | 4 | 0 | 613-20”-bangs<br /><br />I would buy this again! It came in a bag, tangle free and had a slight smell to it. Bangs are long enough to be cut to desired length. In both pictures they are uncut.<br /><br />The first picture is it straight out of the bag, only styling the bangs with a flat iron. The second picture is after a color bath and styling.<br /><br />THE ENDS TAKE COLOR QUICKLY! I dipped mine in a purple shampoo bath, leaving the ends out (only allowing the water to touch it when squeezing the water out) and they still took more color than the top of the wig, along with the bangs. Holds styling well, went all day without losing curls even in the snow.<br /><br />I would say it’s all human hair, I don’t see any plastic hairs or had any melting when styling.<br /><br />The wig is 20” from top to bottom, though I was expecting the hair to be 20”. It’s a comfortable stretchy mesh cap, and fits my larger head snuggly. My head is about 23” around, so heads 22”-24” should be fine wearing this.\n",
      "10828->Quite surprisng | 4 | 0 | This is a very pale mud mask. It spreads really easily. It's not as 'mud' looking as most of the other ones I've tried. Makes you look like a ghost appearance wise or someone who is very pale.<br />I left this one for about an hr. It never cracked, but it was there as a very light mask. Easy to wash off. My skin felt very soft afterwards. I was surprised really as I had left it on for so long I'd almost forgotten about it.<br />I feel that the mud mask did have a restorative effect to my skin. It also has a very subtle (and I mean subtle) flower scent. I liked the scent but was happy that it wasn't too strong as I have extremely sensitive facial skin and perfumed skin products make me itch.<br />My skin still feels softer 24 hrs later.\n",

      "10846->Lovely serum but very expensive | 4 | 0 | I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Age Renewal Serum comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $120 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with phytobiotics stem cells, botanical hyaluronic acid, retinol, Vitamins and various herbs. Keep in mind, whenever you use retinol to use sun blocker since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to sun light. This particular blend is supposed to help protect your skin against environmental stressors and resulting in youthful looking skin while hydrating it. When you use this you will notice this serum it has the most pleasant fragrance of the 4 that I have and is actually pleasant and not as reminiscent of an essential oil as the others are.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin. When I use this my skin feels nice and soft, very smooth and definitely looks beautifully hydrated, thanks hyaluronic acid.  Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that also have hyaluronic acid that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this serum. But I do like this one and it is a very high quality product.\n",
      "10847->Nice colors formula needs some work | 3 | 0 | Nice looking set colors are beautiful.  All though I love the colors, the formula needs some re-working.<br />When applying the base coat it began separating on my nail like it had oil in it.  My nails didn't last longer than two days before it started to lift and peel.\n",
      "10854->Fits funny, hair is too thin, and the top is bang heavy | 2 | 0 | I decided to try this wig with no reviews because you never know, it could be great and I liked the style of it. But I have to say that it's thinner than it looks in the pictures, and the top of the wig is very weird. It's super thick and very bang heavy. It's hard to style it in a way that looks current or fashionable and it really looks like a wig when on.<br />I have also had trouble keeping it on, though I have not secured it with bobby pins, which I'm sure would help keep it in place. I would never wear this for anything other than Halloween, because it just looks too fake, unfortunately.<br />Not recommended!\n",
      "10860->You're reading reviews for the sleep mask, be aware! | 3 | 0 | I love this company a lot and can swear by the sleep mask as an amazing moisturizer.<br /><br />But we're not talking about the moisturizer.<br /><br />The Mood Change clarifying mask does its job - it says leave on for 3-10 minutes.<br />I was like...three minutes?  Only?  Huh.<br />And now I know why.<br /><br />It burns.  It burns with the passion of a thousand menthol suns.  My skin was straight red after around the ten minute mark.  There IS no leaving this on overnight, that comment was for the sleep mask.<br />Which I do frequently for that product.<br />Because it soothes.<br /><br />I won't give it one star because I did notice it pulled things to the surface immediately, and I am aware I might just be sensitive to the product itself.  It wasn't as drying as masks can be which was also a huge plus.<br /><br />I guess ultimately if you get this, be careful and don't leave it on too long!\n",

      "10936->Fantastic product that does what it promises | 5 | 0 | I really like this Tone Up Cream. It is a great little moisturizer that I like to use during the day a lot. It adds a nice little glow I find to my skin that just gives it a little extra. I don't like to wear foundation every day but instead like to wear tinted kind of products on occasion, just a little bit of something. This one is along those lines just a step back I think since it only adds a bit of glow really while giving a lot of moisture to your skin which it really needs right now. With wearing masks a lot my face is suffering and this really helps countering those effects.<br /><br />This moisturizer comes in a cute little squeeze tube that I do like. It smells very nice, a scent I can't pin point but is very lovely.\n",

My scars have diminished in color and severity and my skin looks smooth and plumped. As I write a blog about my foray into cruelty-free products this was right up my alley.  I wrote an independent account of my experience at amberbutbetter.blogspot.com.<br /><br />The down side is that I haven't noticed a difference in my dark spots (sun spots).<br />For comparison my skin is oily and acne prone and not sensitive. I use this product daily in my evening skin routine.\n",
      "10976->They don't stay on very long | 3 | 0 | The lashes are nice and there are options for several tastes in length.<br /><br />Unfortunately these don't stay on very well and very long.<br /><br />I own another set where I had to remove the lashes after 3 days - they stayed on that well.<br /><br />These start to peel off after a few hours.  I even tried putting more liner to test but they just don't adhere that well.<br /><br />It's a no for me.  I would not buy them when there are other brands that not only stay on for days but that also have more pairs in the kit and are very easy to remove.\n",
      "10980->Big combs for curly hair | 4 | 0 | I need big combs like this because I have very thick curly hair. I love these combs except that the teeth break somewhat easily. You have to be careful with them.<br />But I'll get more of these in the future. They are easy to use, they stay put, and they are overall good.. Just be gentle\n",
      "10993->Cheap for sure. | 2 | 0 | Arrived quickly enough, but quality is NOT what I expected... my fault, I thought I was paying for one ribbon and wand, didn't realize you got 5... Great price if you need several, but really  not quality for ones I've seen before. Thing wand, ribbon is cheap and SHORT. I should have read though better, for sure, but unless you're using in a class or for party favors, where you don't need or want excellent quality, this is not worth it.<br />Probably will not return because of COST to return, but am sorry I purchased this for my 5 year old.\n",
      "11017->Great detangler but not as sturdy | 3 | 0 | Does a great job getting out tangles, even in wet hair. The only reason I didn't date higher is that the handle is short and hard to hold. I end up holding the body of the brush instead.<br />7/10/17 Update: several bristles have broken off easily only a few weeks in. I don't know how long this brush will hold up.\n",
      "11021->Great quality! But seriously annoyed with the ever rising outrageous price! | 3 | 0 | ***Update, I think it's ridiculous how fast the price keeps raising for these! We shouldn't have to be rich in order to buy all natural deodorant. This is a good deodorant but over $17 for 2 ounces!? Seriously what the actual F#%&?? I already had a hard time paying around $9..<br />Super fast shipping! My husband loves it, he has sensitive skin & was getting tons of rashes from store bought deodorants.. this was just what he needed. It seems like a small amount for the price but a little goes a long way. He wants to try the stick version next, hoping it will be available in patchouli scent in the future. Disappointed that the price went up even more! Going to try an off brand next.\n",
      "11030->Turned my hair dull brown/gray | 2 | 0 | This does NOT work if you have well water. Everything I read said that this would just be a conditioning treatment but this turned my hair a dingy brownish gray. It was awful! Having read more online about cassia treatments, I've learned that you cannot use this with well water or water buildup. This should be on the packaging in LARGE PRINT.<br />I guess it should work fine if you've done a clarifying treatment recently and you're using distilled water, but who would think to do all that?? Probably smarter people than I. Well, you've been warned.\n",
      "11038->Good value for what you get | 3 | 0 | These hair pins are very attractive but will fall apart quickly I’m sure.<br />There are no “teeth” on these barrettes, so they do not hold very well.<br />Nevertheless, because they look better than other barrettes, I’m keeping them.\n",
      "11045->It works better as a liquid eyeliner | 3 | 0 | I was super excited to try this out, especially because my alternative is more expensive. It got here in 2 days. I was disappointed for sure. I’ll be going back to my normal.<br /><br />I order jet black<br /><br />Looks good in a photo but does not last because of natural oils from skin as well as mild sweating.<br /><br />Even after application  it still transferred into a dry napkin.<br /><br />It does not last for days.<br />Great for a quick wear<br />Goes on pretty fierce\n",
      "11079->Shop & Compare Product | 3 | 0 | I love the different size of magnification,  however, the light is not illuminated enough to do make-up.<br /><br />I still had to add a stick light on the wall next to where I use this.<br />I'm not saying don't buy this . . . just research other products and compare.\n",
      "11101->Quality and affordable price | 5 | 0 | A wonderful treatment for the skin<br />And such great results that can be delivered to your door with Amazon\n",
      "11127->Terrible | 1 | 0 | I bought the foundation and decided to try their primer. I applied a thin layer of primer and the makeup. It shows all my pores and made the makeup look thick and horrible. My nose looked ridiculous. I used the translucent powder and it made it worse.<br /><br />I wiped it off my nose and used L’Oréal pore reducing primer and it looked fine.<br /><br />Horrible product unless your skin is flawless I guess.\n",
      "11138->Serviceable Badger Brush | 3 | 0 | There are several badger brushes at this price point. This one is a decent performer for the price, but for more money, you will be able to buy a softer brush.<br /><br />Packaging: The brush comes in an attractive box, so you can give it as a gift. The brown stripes in the resin give the impression of lacquered wood, and the silver-colored aluminum alloy trim pieces are without blemish. It’s a good-looking brush. And it fits nicely in the brush holder I have. Some of the advertising copy could use a good going over--it's awkwardly written (\"best gift for gentleman\"???).<br /><br />Performance: For this price, you can get badger bristles. For more money, you will get softer bristles, and more of them. This is a modest-sized brush, but it is adequate for creating, holding, and spreading lather. When I used it, I could feel a couple of bristles poking at my face. Most of them were soft, but these few made the experience less than ideal. On a second use, they seemed a bit softer (but still noticeable), so perhaps over time the lanolin in the soap will work some magic. But on my more-expensive brushes, this was never a problem.<br /><br />Value: A higher price is no guarantee of better quality, but my experience over many years of using a variety of shaving brushes says you will get more if you pay more. Still, this brush does work. And it is three, four, even ten times cheaper than other, softer badger brushes. My advice is to splurge on your brush and economize elsewhere. But if this is the price point you are shopping at, this one will do just fine.\n",
      "11147->A Stay Put Headband That Works With Short Hair | 4 | 0 | When the covid pandemic hit I had a very short pixie cut, which gradually turned into a mullet because I was unable to get a haircut. I am a creature of habit and I have been getting my hair cut by the same person every fourth Saturday at 9 am for the past seven years. I do not like change. A lot of things happened at the same time. The person who cut my hair moved away, covid shut down our world and my hair continued to grow. I was a mess. I tried using stretchy elastic headbands and found those stayed in place for about fifteen seconds. I successfully used felt backed headbands, but as my hair has grown longer I've found the hair in the back does not cooperate as nicely and the back of the band slips up constantly.<br /><br />I decided to try these bands only because I am now desperate. They work. Huzzah.<br /><br />I will say that I wish they were a little wider and in black, but I know they are meant to appeal to women and girls who want to accessorize and not to people like me who have on more than one occasion stated \"my favorite color is gray\". These headbands stay in place. I have been wearing the plain green one for about six hours in the kitchen, around our two dogs and doing laundry and it has not moved. Also, it does not pinch behind my ears, which I completely anticipated being a problem I would need to deal with, but I was wrong. I have noticed the felt backing has already started to come unglued, which means I am going to need to get the glue gun out and fix it. These are not headbands that are made to last for years. The price does reflect that fact.\n",
      "11156->💓💖💕🛁🛁 Enhance Your Bubble Bath Relaxation Experience🛁🛁💕💖💓 | 4 | 0 | After a hard day's work or workout session, there's nothing better than nothing than soaking myself in a bubble bath with epsom salt - it really helps me with relaxation & pain relief. I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Charyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub/Spa』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head/neck comfortably.<br /><br /> INSTALLATION<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it. For those of you having issues, remember to put the thin, rectangular strip portion around the rim of the bathtub, and the wide part on the slanted portion of the tub & that's where your neck and head would rest on while soaking in the bathtub.<br /><br /> REMOVAL<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />A few words of cautions, after you're done, make sure you slide the bathtub pillow suction cups off the tub instead of pulling them off, trust me - you pull enough times, the suction cups will no doubt be severed from the pillow main body.<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />  I think this bathtub pillow works well, allowing me to get the true relaxation bubble bath experience that it's designed for. As long as you follow the aforementioned tips, it really does the job. It would have been nice to have a hook so that upon removal I can hang it inside the bathtub area like bathtub caddy or showerhead allowing it to dripdry.<br /><br />💓💖💕🛁🛁 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED🛁🛁💕💖💓\n",
      "11159->Great mini-size. Grit doesn't last long | 3 | 0 | Pros:<br />Great size, perfect for my desk and bedstand and car, etc.<br /><br />Eh:<br />The patterns are \"eh,\" some suck and some are decent.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The grit wears out very quickly. Faster than a regular cardboard/foam emery board. That sucks. I was hoping that the glass version was an option that would be more durable and last longer. But, sadly, it is not. I'd say within a week, I had worn both sides down on at least 3 of these, so it is now just smooth glass in those spots ....<br />I was willing to make an investment on something that was longer lasting and potentially more eco-friendly (than buying the cardboard/foam ones all the time), but I will have to go back to the cardboard/foam ones until I find something more durable.<br />There is no way that throwing away that much glass every 2 weeks is better than using cardboard/foam. ....\n",
      "11168->Fantastic sheer color! | 4 | 0 | I have always been a voracious nail biter... Until covid19!<br /><br />Since February, I've quit biting my nails and have kept them polished.  I tried the brands I was familiar with, but the formulas weren't the same.<br />Heard good things about Essie, and decided to try it.<br /><br />So glad it did. The shade Sheer Luck is perfect in every way for me. Sheer enough to wear to work, but enough color that I love it!  Went on easy (picture shows 3 coats) and dried bubble free.<br /><br />Loved it so much, I went today and bought three gel couture colors and the top coat!\n",
      "11180->Odd scents | 2 | 0 | The way a product smells is just as important for me as how it performs.<br />In this case I just couldn't get past the way these products smelled.<br /><br />The face wash had a strong alcohol like smell to it, but not as noticable when scrubbing my face.<br /><br />The toner smelled sour. Gross.<br /><br />The skin creme had a light citrus/floral scent. Easily the best smelling of the bunch, and the only item out of this product line I would continue to use.\n",
      "11193->DID NOT WORK! | 3 | 0 | I have been using it for a month and I saw no change! -  Now I changed my opinion because they give me my money back.. so they are 100% real.. It's really sad it doesn't work on me, but I am thinking to give it another opportunity.. so maybe I will order it again and I hope this second time it works. If it happens I will definitely give them 5 stars<br /><br />Thank you\n",
      "11199->Perfectly moisturized skin that smells heavenly of coconut | 5 | 0 | Now this is a body lotion I can only recommend. It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.\n",
      "11202->Great brushes! | 5 | 0 | These wooden brushes are just plain fantastic. The bristles are nice and stiff but not too stiff to hurt you. Stiff enough however to stimulate to provide a good scrub, wet or dry for that matter. You get 2 brushes in this set and one handle that you can put on either brush.<br />One is a nice round brush with nylon bristles that are good for scrubbing your feet that cleanses, softens and smooths the skin. The second brush is an oval brush that just has the stiff boar bristles that helps to exfoliate and smooths the skin.<br /><br />Using these brushes dry helps cleanse your skin but also stimulates your lymphatic system. It promotes blood circulation, helps excrete toxins and relaxes your muscles. Plus it just feels great! You can switch the handle between these two brushes for the one you need it for which is convenient in my eyes. I really like using these and they are just good for you and feel fantastic.\n",
      "11209->For kids | 4 | 0 | This is a fun little set geared towards little girls. It has the nail spacer included in a lovely glittery purple. The nail polish tends towards the clumpy so I added some thinner. I don't expect perfection anyway with nail polish for kids as the little girl in question doesn't sit still long enough for it to dry properly anyway. But thicker polish is destined to be a problem. So thinner is great.<br />The colours are perfect for a little girl and she was thrilled with this set. Teens... may require something a bit more sophisticated.\n",
      "11213->S | 1 | 0 | Its not working now .after 4day<br />The plug not work i need a new plug .\n",
      "11216->Not a shaving brush | 3 | 0 | The description says shaving brush and that's why I bought it. But the brush box says its a Beard Brush. So, I still tried using it as a shaving brush. Big mistake. It was like using a pot & pan scrub brush. I couldn't raise up a lather it's so stiff. But it did a nice job exfoliating my face.<br /><br />Badger? Don't think so. I have many real badger brushes. This appears to be horse or boar. There might be some goat mixed in, who knows for sure?\n",
      "11222->Five Stars | 5 | 0 | Good stuff reliable, gets the job done,<br />battery lasts at least 4-5 days.\n",
      "11234->Very hard to put on | 3 | 0 | Very hard to keep it on the dryer. And the heat would come through the cracks burning my fingers.<br />I’d think it was up there good and a day later it’s falling off. I had to duck tape it. But after using tape it’s been staying on pretty good.\n",
      "11236->Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up | 4 | 0 | I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. \n",
      "11238->My favorite body spray! | 5 | 0 | This stuff is amazing. It used to be like three bucks at Target, and when they stopped carrying it I couldn't find it anywhere until Amazon started selling it. Though it's now about 10 bucks a can it's still VERY worth it to me. I've gotten so many compliments while wearing this, and being told I smell good is probably one of my favorite compliments haha.<br /><br />Great value, lasts pretty long, and smells amazing!\n",
      "11239->Good replacement brush | 4 | 0 | Overall a decent alternative to the originals.  My brush's didn't feel extremely soft but they weren't stiff or hard either.  To me they compare the normal brush head stiffness of original Oral B heads.<br /><br />I still prefer the floss head type, but these will work just fine.\n",
      "11246->Great bath pillow, just wish it were thicker | 4 | 0 | I love to just chill in the tub after a long day and wanted to have something that would make it more comfortable. I have tried the thick pillow only options, but it just didn't work so when I saw this I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />I love that it is washable and even has a little hanger that I can use to dry it after use. The only thing that would make it better is if it were thicker. Still a great buy for the price.\n",
      "11266->Ok set of tunnels & flares | 3 | 0 | The quality of these tunnels is not the highest but reflects the cheap price. They are all like the image but just a bit more rough than expected- still wearable tho and thankfully no threading issues.<br />The flare are pretty neat - just wish the steel cut items were a bit nicer looking.\n",
      "11288->Strongly Scented and Feels Great, But Sticky and Overpriced | 4 | 0 | The Isa Lazo Body Scrub comes in a heavy round jar. The outside of the jar was somewhat sticky so I wasn't happy about the way it was packaged - it should be in a bag of some sort to prevent leaks.<br /><br />Except for that, this scrub has a pleasant, relaxing scent. It consists of coffee colored crystals. You get a lot - about 8.8 ounces worth. I rubbed it on my legs and under the soles of my feet. There is a slight oiliness to the scrub that you often don't get from other scrubs - it's probably from the essential oils. After rinsing it off, I felt my dry skin feel much softer and hydrated. It really provides a nice semi-spa experience.<br /><br />The price, however, is off the charts. I've used many scrubs and I'm not sure this one is worth the cost. The ingredients seem to be of high quality, though, so if you can afford it, indulge!\n",
      "11290->This seems to be a good moisturizer. I have not seen any difference | 3 | 0 | This seems to be a good moisturizer.  I have not seen any difference, however, in fine lines<br />or firmness around the eye area after 3 months of use.\n",
      "11308->Perfect for summer! | 5 | 0 | This color is amazing!! Im so happy I took a chance on it. Its a hard color to explain, its like a darker traffic cone orange lol. (For some reason we actually had a traffic cone at my job so I took a side-by-side too)<br /><br />The application itself went smoothly. Two coats was perfect for solid coverage. Bottle is a decent size too, most gels are small bottles. Looks like high quality stuff, I'm certain it'll last awhile. Will update review when I see chips/issues.\n",
      "11310->Very creamy but effective | 5 | 0 | This Retinol Moisturizer glides onto your skin feeling creamy and wonderful. I can feel the vitamins and natural oils at work.  But after about three or four days I did begin to notice exfoliation taking place.<br />We all know it's kind of a hassle to exfoliate, but I've found if I buy a gentle scrub to slowly rub the extra dead skin away, I have an amazing clear luminous glow I never would have had without the Retinol and that exfoliation.<br />I definitely recommend anyone that wants their to glow, buy this product.\n",
      "11315->Great for the price. | 3 | 0 | This clip in bang is a good item for the price. The hair is decent quality and holds up to washing and styling. It has three clips: one at the apex and two at the hairline, which help the piece stay in very well.<br /><br /> I do have two major complaints:<br /><br />1. The shape of the weft is oddly irregular, thick and stiff, which means I have to play around with the placement and styling quite a bit.<br /><br />2. At the top of the bang the hair is thinner, meaning the weft shows through quite a bit.<br /><br />However, the price is great, and overall it is a nice item. I will be purchasing again.\n",
      "11317->Nice perfume scent instead of the harsh chemical smell | 5 | 0 | This Acetone Free Nail Polish remover is great!  It works as well as acetone to remove nail polish and doesn't give off a headache-inducing smell when doing it.  In fact, there is a slight perfume smell to it.<br /><br />The only thing to note is that it leaves the hands oily after use, but that's not a big problem at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended because it is much less harsh than the traditional method and even more recommended for anyone who gets a headache from the fumes.\n",
      "11357->Makes super high heels bearable | 4 | 0 | Makes high heels bearable, not comfortable. They are not miracle workers but would recommend for improving comfort.<br /><br />They were received timely and with no problems.\n",
      "11361->No reason To Use This Product | 2 | 0 | I had thought this product would be less irritating to the skin when used as a beard color. It's not. The capsules are extremely old or so tightly packed that opening them is virtually impossible. Ultimately I was forced to use scissors, and the contents flew all over the place when I cut into three capsules. After wasting five capsules (to get two), I finally got enough lumpy mixture to use on my beard. The skin irritation was just as irritating as the primary competitor to this product, at less than half the price.<br /><br />With all the difficulty opening these capsules and mixing the hydrogen peroxide and powder, so the product was usable, I spent well more than double the time as the competitive product. At three times the price, the packaging for this item is ridiculously cheap and hard to deal with.<br /><br />All and all, I wanted this item to work, but it's a no-go, and I'll be returning to the other brand.\n",
      "11363->Very nice...😃 | 4 | 0 | These hair bows are very nice.  Haven’t had to wash and dry yet.  They look nice in my hair...<br />  Thanks 😃\n",
      "11371->Only lasted a few hours before makeup meltdown | 3 | 0 | First, I wanted to try each product by itself to see if they did what they are suppose to do individually...these products do not work by themselves. That led me to believe that together, they probably wouldn't work as well as they advertise these products ( aka the Best Selling Primer on the Market). I was wrong; when I tried them all together, they worked! But...they only lasted a few hours. My pores started showing through and the primer caused my makeup to crease. Yet, while it lasted, my makeup almost looked flawless, but when you wear makeup all day, having the product suddenly cause a makeup meltdown is stress inducing.<br />Positives: the products are lightweight - - - I never really felt them when I put them (as directed on the back of the box, and yes, there is English on the back). I have super sensitive skin, and had no reaction to the products either individually or together.<br />Negative: I have used better moisture primers that were just vitamin E and Argan oil.<br />These are travel size versions of the products: all three are .50 fl oz.<br />I don't think I would get this again because it only lasted a few hours for me, but if you only need it that long, then this would be great for you.<br />The products have a 12 month shelf life.\n",
      "11378->No changes yet , the smell though is great ! | 3 | 0 | Love the smell.<br />Been using it once aweek and i been having it for about 4 weeks now . Using it once a week .<br />Havent seen a change yet.<br />My hair smell great though !<br />If any changes in the next couple months will update the review\n",
      "11381->Wrong color | 3 | 0 | It says Plum, but it is more of a pinkish. I don’t like on a fair skin like mine.<br />Good quality, though, like all Clinique products. And great  price!\n",
      "11420->Color was off for me | 3 | 0 | Product came quickly and was as advertised.<br />Unfortnetely it was a really bad color match to my hair so  have to return it.<br />It looked right on-line but it's alwasy hard to tell.\n",
      "11421->Portable | 3 | 0 | I like the idea of separate handsanitizing packaging. I easily put 2-3 of them in my bag's pocket and use when I'm outside and don't have access to water and soap. It is also ideal for kid's hands too when we want to dine out of home or sanitizing after playing in the park.<br />The only thing I can say about it, is that the moisture is not enough and gets dry sooner than other wipes but maybe it's the way that works to sanitize the skin!<br />I like that it is environment friendly, so you pay more to help the environment.\n",
      "11432->Good product but quantity misleading: Only one pen included! | 2 | 0 | Is it just me? I have purchased this exact product several times--happily--in dark brown, grey brown, and chestnut (red brown). My eyebrows are, like my natural hair, about a level 4 or 5 dark brown, and the grey brown is probably the closest, though the other colors are handy for changes of color to hair and makeup. My brows are thinning, but a little filling in does the trick, and these pens are my favorite tool for the job, as they both color in where you need solid filling and can be used to make feathery strokes for a more natural brow look. This pen came with a useless little razor and three eyebrow \"templates,\" only one of which I might consider useful (if you are new to shaping your brows).<br />The problem:<br />In the past I have received (I see now from other sellers) at least two or three pens for $6.99 to $8.99. I can't believe I paid over $8 for just one pen from this seller \"Generies.\" Going back over the seller page, I see that indeed, by the pictures it appears that one will receive two pens. A sneaky little trick, showing the same photos as the sellers with better deals, but neglecting to include the \"2 CT.\" If you are busy or distracted in the least, you might fall for it, as did I--and doubtless, as have many customers.<br />I really dislike writing negative comments, but am doing this to save others the trouble and disappointment of feeling ripped off. Needless to say, I will be buying this product from other sellers in future--the ones with the more reasonable--and honest--deals.\n",
      "11443->MEH! | 2 | 0 | Meh! Doesn’t flatten out my curls like some products do, but doesn’t enhance them, either, which is what I was expecting. The scent is orangey and not unpleasant, but thankfully does not linger.  (Personally, I don’t care to smell like something edible.)<br />Considering the price, I expected a WHOLE lot more.  I cannot recommend them, nor will I purchase again.  At this price, I think I have the right to WOW! products.  These are just meh.\n",
      "11468->Cheaply made/ Decent for thin hair | 2 | 0 | Thought I  finally found the right clips for thin hair.<br />After 2 uses this clip snapped in 2.<br />The banana clips are very difficult to open. So I  don't know how sturdy they are at this point.<br />Update: after closer inspection  I found the clip wasn't broken. Just came apart. There is a slot, I was unaware of, so repaired for now.<br />For those of us with arthritis in our hands, this type of clip is better than most as far as ease of use.\n",
      "11480->Buyer beware! Cheap aluminum, NOT ceramic!!! | 1 | 0 | Buyer beware! This is NOT a ceramic core, this is cheap aluminum covered in matte tan paint.<br /><br />I've had this for a year, and it's never given me the results I'd expect from a ceramic core. It's my least favorite brush, because the temperature spikes and drops too quickly. Now I know why! The terrible heat retention is because this is made of aluminum! Not only is this is terrible for your hair, this is deceptive! The product description says \"material: ceramic\". Lies!<br /><br />Shame on them!\n",
      "11493->Looks natural | 4 | 0 | I love this hair, it stays on well, however it’s starting to dry out at the ends, not sure we’re I'm going with this, ether trim or try oils.<br />But I love how it looks so far\n",
      "11494->Made my face feel greasy | 3 | 0 | I really wanted to like this facial serum. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is common for this kind of product. The serum is a prickly pear oil that is supposed to be very good for your face.<br /><br />When you use it you will first notice the fragrance of the oil. I am not sure if maybe my bottle went bad, but mine just smelled very bad, almost like oil that went rancid. I really didn’t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time. I would not recommend using this during the day. Especially when wearing a mask, using a facial oil that leaves an oily residue makes my face very hot and sweaty, just awful and this one would do exactly that. Sadly this one is just average at best and I will not be re-purchasing when I run out.\n",
      "11502->Meh, expensive and does not last long. | 3 | 0 | I used this kit twice and found that it wears off on the tips of my nails really fast like three days into a fresh manicure. IMHO for $20 a bottle for polish + their topcoat, etc<br />Sorry but my inlp, orly, and Revlon lasts a full two weeks and then some\n",
      "11521->Dry Brushing for Leaky Gut Detox | 5 | 0 | I read, on a leaky gut blog, about dry brushing while doing detoxes so I ordered this brush to give it a try.  This thing is pretty cool to be honest and I am so glad I opted for the brush that can be modified as such.  I hate having “stuff” so anytime I can consolidate a product to be multi-use, especially living in a small space, it really helps.  So using the brush does not feel entirely unpleasant but I am sure it will be something to get used to.  It came wrapped in cellophane and really pretty tulle that it actually looked like a gift (a note for anyone ordering as a gift there is really no need to pay the extra fee for gift wrapping services).  Also there is a velour draw string bag that fits the brush when it is assembled.  The purple is gorgeous kind of reminds me of a Crown bag.  I tested the brush out on one arm at work (I have packages delivered to me at work) and my coworker said my arm feels softer than the other.  Oh and the TMI factor-I am calling it fairy dust for now but the white dust that flew off my arm, presumably dead skin, is kind of gross to see.  Makes me want to go home and brush every bit!  And so I will! I rarely give all 5 stars but I already love this thing<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  This is a required disclaimer per Amazon’s review guidelines.

      "11539->Just ok | 2 | 0 | Got it for my husband,overall kinda disappointed. I got it for the eyebrow trimmer and it's not that good at trimming. My husband used it for the first time. The nose and ear trimmer came apart the cutter thing came out he was able to put it back in. The other two attachments seem to work ok at least so far. The battery seems to be ok. I guess it's not that big of a deal for the price.<br /><br />If you're looking for a eyebrow trimmer I'd recommend looking at another one. If on the other hand you are looking for a rechargeable beard trimmer it might be what you want.\n",
      "11540->Lovely Serum | 4 | 0 | This is a very thick serum that feels extremely soothing to my skin.<br /><br />I have very dry, mature skin that needs lots of moisture so I use this before moisturizing.<br /><br />I also love the natural ingredients in this serum.  The scent from the yarrow is soft and pleasant.<br /><br />My skin is not only dry, it's pretty sensitive to a lot of products. I've had no problems at all with this serum.  No tiny bumps in my forehead, no redness, just smooth skin.<br /><br />I don't see a firmer reflection in the mirror yet but my skin feels great and a bit firmer from the inside. Does that make sense?<br /><br />This is a lovely product.<br /><br />I hope this helps you.\n",
      "11547->Very  nice essence, very toner like | 4 | 0 | This is a very nice serum. It has sedum extract in it which is supposed to help adding hydration to the skin, which in turn adds firmness and elasticity. It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. I for one do like it quite a bit. This is more like a toner and you use it quite similarly to one. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels a tad sticky at first but that quickly goes away. My skin does feel nicely moisturized when I use this so I do like this quite a bit. This is a lovely product.\n",
      "11558->I got the products but it's not the color I wanted. | 2 | 0 | So I ordered the clear and while yes I did technically get a latex body paint I got purple which is not what I ordered I figure if you're gonna give me the choice of picking a color you should at least give me that color.<br />If you're going to order this I really hope the color doesn't matter to you or your project.\n",
      "11583->THESE ARE NOT FOR FACIAL FLEX BEGINNERS!!! | 3 | 0 | I initially thought these were a scam product until I went to Facial Flex’s website to order replacements and found that they sell different “oz” based on how long you’ve been using the product (but nowhere on their website do they explain when you should move up in weight… size… whatever)… to further explain, when you first get your facial flex device, you start with a 6oz band (band resistance for muscle building) (side note: The device seems to be working but how cheap do you have to be to provide ONE BAND that’s supposed to BE CHANGED WEEKLY!!!?). Then after however long, again, their website doesn’t say when, you would move up to 8oz bands, then 16oz.<br /><br />Long story short, THESE ARE NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!\n",

      "11628->Works well on dirty paws...if it fits | 4 | 0 | These types of paw washing cups are an excellent way to clean muddy paws. I’m so glad the days of lugging a bucket of water are behind me. I’ve tried a couple different versions and found this one to be good, if it fits your dog’s paws.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it’s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that’s good for cleaning, if you’re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog’s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn’t see a size noted when I ordered, so I’m not quite sure if it’s possible to order different sizes since I don’t see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn’t too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth. My dogs feet come out pretty wet, so the cloth is soaked by the time I’m done wiping her feet. I use a towel instead.\n",
      "11631->Not a fan | 2 | 0 | I can't really find the right words to express exactly why I just wasn't a fan, but among the issues were I didn't care for the size of the tube, I found it to be too big for me, and my hands aren't the smallest, so I can't imagine a really petite person w/ tiny hands trying to use this big axx wand! I didn't like how it came out and the application onto my lashes, I found it to just be kinda messy and they would end up clumping together. I have been trying to find something comparable to Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara and this definitely isn't it!<br /><br />I've heard good things about other Essence mascara's but this one isn't among them probably for a reason.\n",
      "11642->Nice item, but takes practice to use. | 5 | 0 | Once I learn to use it, so I don't  look a clown, I'll  love this product. But it will take a bit of practice.<br />I do wish though, that it came  in a lighter colour.<br />It's a bit too dark for me, as I am turning gray.\n",

      "11671->No access to outlet . Wobbly | 2 | 0 | No access to outlets . Door in the way .<br />Wobbly . Station is lower the others that I have had in the past . Like the look of it but nit function.\n",
      "11690->Pass on this one | 2 | 0 | Really not worth the money.  You could buy off the rack at a retail store, and get better for far less the $$$$.<br />It's not full coverage but if you're looking for something quick and convenient, this would work.\n",
      "11699->A decent micellar water pad | 4 | 0 | These are really handy to have.  I find using a makeup removing cream or gel a bit annoying and any sort of wash type remover ends up trailing down my arms and neck.  You know how when you see women on movies gently splashing their faces and not making a mess?  Well that's not me.  So back to the pads.  I do like them.  They're nicely soaked and a decent size, about the size of a large cotton pad but it took 3 pads to make an inroad at removing my makeup and I don't think I plaster it on, just a bit of foundation, some mascara and a bit of blush.  The bonus is that you can use both sides but I do think it could do a better job at actual makeup remover.  For a quick cleanup and removing tinted moisturiser it does a good enough job.  If you're using it as part of a multi phase make up removal which I do when I have the time and motivation then this is a great second step.  I didn't have any adverse reactions.  I didn't dislike them, I just wasn't blown away by them and my search for the unicorn of make up removers continues.<br /><br />All in all they work as well as your average micellar water with the added convenience of having the pad and micellar water all in one.\n",
      "11708->Nothing like in the picture | 1 | 0 | The palette is so much darker! Nothing like on the picture at all! I cannot and don't want to use it. So disappointing<br />Also it came sort of dusted all over - because the Packaging was very poor.\n",
      "11715->My hands love this! | 5 | 0 | Best hand creme, hands down...<br /><br />But seriously, it keeps my hands so happy! I wish it came in larger tubes though.\n",
      "11717->Omg omg omg | 5 | 0 | I absolutely love this this. I am officially obsessed with baebody! Although, like I mentioned in other names not a huge fan of the name but the quality.. Woah. The quality is there. I like that this scrub is a little drier. Why? Because it's not gross and goopy and getting everywhere. When a scrub is drier it is more versatile for your hands, feet, and where ever. I tested this on my hands and omg did my hands feel amazingly soft afterward. It's late and I am too tired to try on my feet but I am now really looking forward to my next shower!<br /><br />I do think this will preform best a bit dry first then dampen. You could also soak your feet in warm water to soften the skin and more than likely get optimal results!!!<br /><br />Well worth it!!!\n",
      "11735->Perfect for bridal party! ❤️ | 4 | 0 | I love these, these are so cute and would be great for a photo-op. They are great items to put into gift bags for your bridesmaids.<br /><br />I think that these would be so great during the summer, and amazing if someone was having a beach wedding!<br />(Also, if you are having a girls weekend  Bachelorette party, these would also be a great gift for those girls of yours, you all can wear them and match!!!! And then you can have the scrunchies for your wedding!!!)<br /><br />I can see many opportunities for you and your girls to use these.<br /><br />A little touch like this, can be fun and I love the heart glasses because they are so cute, but I also love the touch of humor on the scrunchies. The bridal party would love the fact that it says, \"to have and to hold your hair back\". It makes me smile, every time I read that! It adds abit a humor to it.<br /><br />These scrunchies are extremely comfortable, my daughter usually hates scrunchies, they usually fall out of her hair easily but she seems to love these. As for the sunglasses, my daughter didn't care to much for it, she said it doesn't sit on her nose correctly but it seemed to look good on her. I actually love the sunglasses. It adds a special touch that we needed.<br /><br />I would recommend these for a wedding on the beach or in the summer, or if you expect it to be a bright sunny day!<br /><br />I would also recommend these as items to put into bridesmaids gift bags.<br /><br />The quality seems to be exactly what I had expected and I am quite pleased.<br /><br />I would like to note: You may not want go wear the sun glasses all day, but for a few hours here and there, it is quite cute and stylish.<br /><br />These sun glasses and hair bows would also help coordinate your bridal party, without braking the bank. Little touches like this, really does make a difference.<br /><br />(These are to be used for wedding next summer.)\n",

      "11768->So many cool, unique designs! | 5 | 0 | These tattoos are too cool! There are some really cool and original designs in this set!<br />There are twelve different sheets of tattoos in this set, and they are all different! There are birds, cats, feathers, letters, henna designs, and so much more! You and your friends can definitely find a few temporary tattoos to show off your interests for your next girls night out concert! It is so much fun to dress up, and this is a form of dress up! It is a way to express yourself, temporarily! Haha!<br />These are great for kids, too! My girls love them! They love how different they are from their &#34;kiddie&#34; temporary tattoos and they think its so cool when I wear them with them! Haha! As I said above, it is another form of dress up, and what mom doesn't like to dress up with their kids?! It is so fun! And it is interesting to see which tattoos they pick and how they determine which tattoos they are going to wear for that round of dress up! They get so into it! I love it!<br />In addition to the many different designs that are in this set, there are also metallic and white tattoos! Metallic tattoos are so cool! It is like jewelry on your skin! And the white tattoos look really cool in the summer time when my skin is tan! They show up really well for white tattoos, even when I'm not super tan, I was surprised! I really like them!<br />We are definitely satisfied with this purchase, we have had a lot of fun! We will be recommending this product to all of our family and friends!<br />I received this product at discount in exchange for my HONEST review. The discount did not affect my review at all! I take all of my product reviews seriously, whether discounted or not! I rely on these reviews to make informed purchases, as I'm sure you do as well, so I do my best to give my honest thoughts and constructive criticism, if needed. I hope you found this review helpful!\n",
      "11775->Cute on Picture Advertised.  Disappointing in person. | 1 | 0 | I was excited to get this hair especially from the advertised picture. In the middle of it being installed I knew I was going to need at least one more pack so I ordered another set of hair. The hair is not as shiny and silky as the picture shown.  The butterflies are GROWN. In other words too big, too many in one lock and exaggerated to say the least.<br />I also tried distressing some of the butterflies and after it was done that it would look better. Nope<br /><br />Only keeping them in because I wasted money on other hair a couple weeks ago and<br />now this too.  I will find the right ones after a few weeks.\n",
      "11781->Epic fail batch 2-unfortunately, new batch ain't  the same. | 2 | 0 | Epic Fail.Have been eagerly awaiting this order--was bitterly disappointed!!  It's like having an apple substituted by a piece of fake fruit. Yuk!  Will have to contact company re this.<br /><br />I was born with a naturally very full bottom lip so I go thru a lot of lip gloss/lip moisturizer to keep my lower lip from drying out and cracking and splitting.  My go to favorite is a commercial name brand which does an excellent job, smells like mocha, and is a bit pricey.<br />1st order-<br />Name brand move over! This lips moisturizer smells EXACTLY like a maple bar  has a very faint sweet taste, is twice the size of the name brand, and is fairly price.  What's not to love! I really like the very faint sweet taste which gives a hint of sugar without being cloyingly sweet.  The maple bar scent is to die for--no funky chemical scents or the like. I WiLL BE BUYING THS AGAIN!!!<br /><br />Batch 2- not the same formulation.\n",
      "11792->Smells great and works well | 4 | 0 | Smells great and works well. Mostly natural, but does contain yellow 5 and blue 1 dyes, which is the only con, but it is a big con. I would much rather have something that's completely natural and might have a white or &#34;funny&#34; colors, than using dyes that have warnings by the FDA.<br />Otherwise, it feels good in the shower.<br /><br />Although I have received this product for free/discount, it has not affected the honesty or judgement of my review. All of my reviews are my own honest opinion, whether I pay full price or receive a discount.\n",
      "11794->Representing your skin condition by smiley face! | 4 | 0 | I like a feature that you can see water and oil in your skin by smiley face/ sad face. A spray volume is better than a compact nano mist spray that I have.<br />There are 2 of Chinese manuals which I don’t understand at all.\n",
      "11795->Cute Mirror; Just One Tiny Issue | 4 | 0 | Great little mirror and totally solid and can stand up to being jostled in my makeup bag. My only issue is that the painting depicted on it is the same on both sides. Because of that, when you open it, you can't tell if you've got the magnified mirror or the regular mirror. Also, because it's a rectangle, sometimes you have to turn it on its side after you flip it open to get a wider view.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, this is a great little mirror. Well-made and pleasing to the eye. Great stocking-stuffer or gift to add to shower-favor-bags. Also great \"Secret Santa\" gift where there's a price limit but you still want to give something nice.<br /><br />4.5 stars.\n",
      "11817->Good product just takes a while to remove | 4 | 0 | It will take off your color street strips but take a couple applications leaving it on for a really long time<br />Love the smell though<br />For regular polish would probably work great but nothing with multiple layers\n",
      "11878->Use a base color first! | 4 | 0 | Not the best quality but not bad.<br /><br />I was not sure what to expect with such an inexpensive product, until it arrived and I found out the powders are from Born Pretty! When just following the directions, the powder did not work but I layered it over white, cured for 30 seconds, pressed the powder on, then top it off with a non-wipe top coat. Cured for another 30 seconds and bam! Color changing powder!\n",
      "11893->Somewhat disappointed | 3 | 0 | I used to get these all the time, but disappointed with my most recent order.<br />They seem thinner.\n",
      "11907->New and ripped | 2 | 0 | Just opened it and its ripped. Other than that its good. Print looks clear, fits comfy. FYI-It does press/lays against eyelids,<br />Incase their description didt say ...some are bubbled..\n",
      "11911->Flimsy but cute | 4 | 0 | First impression... theyre super thin and flimsy. We'll see how they hold up with wear... I can already say that I won't repurchase.  I'm too active. I need sturdy nails that can take a beating. But worth a shot. 🤷‍♀️<br /><br />Edit: now that I've got them on theyre actually not bad! I put on 2 coats of nail hardener on them and that really helped. I'm curious to see how long they'll last but they seem solid enough now. I'm expecting a week off wear. So with that being the case I'd say they're worth the money and if repurchase afterall.\n",
      "11916->Not great quality | 2 | 0 | These are too flimsy and weird sizes and the beads are cheaply made. The color isn't as natural as other ones I've purchased,  and it when made it sticks out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />I missed the return window and unhappy with the product. There are better ones out there - this one missed the mark.\n",
      "11948->Bad | 1 | 0 | This product isn't great at all the material , quality and the way it was put together Bad.<br />I wouldn't recommend even tho it was only 5 dollars but not worth it ..\n",
      "11962->Bristles fall out | 2 | 0 | I liked this brush when I started using after Christmas.<br />However, the bristles keep falling out. In a short time I will have to toss this brush. Too bad, because I like it.\n",
      "11975->Salty, Sweet Brown Sugar and Pistachio Cookies | 3 | 0 | B&BW had all of their body sprays on sale for $5 last Sunday, so I stopped in and picked up the new Magic in the Air (very nice), a back up of A Thousand Wishes (surprisingly very nice), and Golden Pear and Brown Sugar. This review is for the last.<br /><br />Top Notes: Italian Bergamot, Decadent Pistachio Mousse, Sugared Almond Cookie.<br /><br />Heart Notes: Caramelised Praline, Toasted Hazelnuts, Plum Blossum.<br /><br />Base Notes: Silken Vanilla, Glazed Chocolate Wood, Whipped Musk.<br /><br />As you can see by the listed notes, this is a sweet gourmand fragrance intended for the Autumn/Winter seasons. It is festive and has a bake shop vibe. In the top and heart notes I am able to detect the pistachio, almond cookie, and hazelnuts, but I do not detect either the bergamot or the plum blossom. As with most B&BW fragrances, this one dries down to the base notes within 15-20 minutes. In the base, I mainly detect vanilla and chocolate. I do not pick up on a musk note which is fine by me because musk is not one of my favourite notes.<br /><br />All in all, this is a well blended, sweet, sugar cookie type of fragrance that is warm and comforting. If you like gourmand scents, especially those with a few or more of these notes, then I think you would like this fragrance. It is probably too sweet and cloying for warm weather, but on cold, windy, wet Autumn/Winter days this fragrance can be the perfect compliment to a cozy sweater in front of a warm fireplace. Smells good enough to eat! The one thing I do not understand is why they named it &#34;Golden Pear&#34; and Brown Sugar. The notes combined definitely give a brown sugar smell, but I do not detect any pear smell.<br /><br />Recommended for those who like (or think they might like) sweet, gourmand fragrances.\n",
      "11981->An adjustment but worth the money | 4 | 0 | I really struggled with these lashes but I had to stop getting extensions so I really just forced myself to get comfortable with them. So I kind of played mad scientist and I'm gonna comfortable with them. I have some tips for anytime struggling.<br /><br />1. If you HATE liquid eyeliner like me, do your eyeliner with whatever you use normally. I like my felt tip pens. So I did my eyeliner, then took the magnetic eyeliner, wiped the excess off the sides back into the tubs, and carefully just did a line thick enough on my eyelash base to get the magnetic property there. It was waaaay easier for me and therefore less messy and I didn't accidentally place them too high, they were truly down on my eyelashes.<br /><br />2. I have very round eyes and they're big but not wide, so I cut them up! Instead of one long strip I have about 5 pieces of each lash to individually put on.<br />I found them easier to put on this way and I didn't have to shorten them to fit my eye, just space them out properly so I'm not just cutting up a good product unnecessarily that I paid full price for.<br /><br />3. Decide if you like the applicator took they gave you or not. I put the lashes on with my fingers, but then use the applicator took to really squeeze them into my normal eyelashes so they blend flawlessly and you can't see an awkward gap between real and fake.<br /><br />4. DO NOT TRY TO JUST RIP THEM OFF!!! You're going to rip your real eyelashes off. I would know, trust me I lost some soldiers the first time I took these off tipsy and just ripped them off 🥴<br />I get a towel and warm water and loosen the product, then an oil-free makeup remover on a soft towel and sat that on for a good minute to really get the magnetic properties off.<br /><br />Overall worth the money but man it was an adjustment.\n",

      "12000->Seems to work well, no weird residue left behind | 5 | 0 | Between regular,  every day germs and now Covid-19, we go through a bunch of sanitizer. It's in the cars, the house, the horse barn and luggage. We tend to use Purell in the giant wall dispensers in the house and barn, but these big bottles are nice too.<br /><br />The sanitizer smells like what it is. This seems a bit thinner than the Purell, but dries quickly enough. I haven't noticed any sticky residue left behind or excessive drying of our skin. I'm taking one of these with me to West Texas tomorrow for use in the truck and cabin. It fits nicely in my overnight bag pocket.\n",
      "12020->Uhh.... ok, will use for skincare routine, then. 3.5 stars ✨ | 4 | 0 | When I saw these I was so excited because they match most of my wardrobe. I'm always wearing my hair up and love wearing skinny hard headbands with ponytails to keep straggly hairs back. I thought this would be something new to try altogether.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fabric is awful to wear in your hair. I am a seamstress and it is definitely synthetic and feels like it. It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use. I'm constantly losing the ones I have, so now I have plenty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3.5 stars for effort and couldn't bear to recommend them. Sorry.\n",
      "12036->A cheap drugstore sunscreen in fancy packaging.  Thick and greasy feeling. | 2 | 0 | This product was advertised in a Wishtrend video as a recommendation for dry skin.  I have been using it for a couple months but ultimately had to put it away and try something else because I couldn't deal with the way this product felt any more.<br /><br />It doesn't feel like skincare or like a great Kbeauty sunscreen.  Kbeauty usually boasts sunscreens that are lightweight, nongreasy, and leave no white cast.  While this doesn't leave a white cast, it feels extremely heavy and greasy.  It comes out very thick and hard to work with.  You have to pull at the skin a lot in order to apply the product evenly.  It takes a long time to absorb and I could tell a big difference in makeup application when I decided to forgo this product some days.  My cushion foundation just did not apply well over this product and it caused it to slide around on my face.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it didn't feel like a high end, high grade sunscreen but rather like any old sunscreen you can get from the store.  Save your money and try something more water/essence like.  I traded this for the Missha soft finish and am MUCH happier.\n",
      "12043->Great gift set | 4 | 0 | This is a fantastic little gift set. It contains a moisturizing cream and an overnight night mask that both come in beautiful little jars.<br /><br />These smell lovely of rose water. They contain some great ingredients like squalene, retinol, Aloe Vera, shea butter, chamomile, hyaluronic acid, argan oil, collagen and more. This is really a little power house.<br /><br />Both are on the lighter side and absorb quickly into your skin. Your skin looks and feels great when you use these. I really this and this makes for a great gift. The price is also fantastic.\n",
      "12051->FIG AND YARROW ORGANIC FACIAL SCRUB | 4 | 0 | I like this facial scrub because it is not harsh and can be rubbed gently into the skin and washed off easily.<br />I have combination (oily and dry) skin and I don't want to have to use a separate item on the oily parts of my skin.  The fact that it has natural ingredients and can be used all over is a good thing.  I use it once or twice a week and also use Christina Moss' facial wash every day. Would recommend other ladies give it a try.\n",
      "12060->Takes forever to remove eye-makeup | 1 | 0 | This is a really crap. Using H2O I have to use a q-tip around 4 q-tips (2 per eye) to remove eye-makeup, and that's after using a makeup-remover wipe for my whole face+using a facial cleanser. I bought it cause it was cheap, but it will cost you valuable time and cause more wrinkles since you spend a lot of time rubbing your eyes with wipes or q-tips to remove your makeup.<br /><br />If you want a real makeup remover, this DHC one is truly magic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UE60E0/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2Z3W7RJXQRHH2<br />^It also works as a facial cleaner. I tried it last week and wow.. it removes everything, even using a q-tip is unnecessary. I am a budget buyer and this is expensive but I will definitely buy this!\n",
      "12068->Pure Sapphire is Disappointing | 1 | 0 | Used Splat for the first time today.  We purchased the Pure Sapphire kit and this is how it turned out.  Very disappointed.  I sectioned her hair off and did her scalp in sections and then started down the body of her hair.  I used a color brush and then my hands to fully coat her hair.  Left it on for an hour and is the result.<br />She is a mixture of strawberry blonde with blonde ombré.\n",
      "12081->Wow! And I mean wow! | 5 | 0 | I’ve tried nearly all the major brands for beard balms and butters. I mostly stick to butters now. The only con I’d say is Detroits beard butters contain beeswax. Had I realized that, I wouldn’t have purchased them. I’m willing to compromise at this point though. I’m hoping Detroit will come out with a VEGAN beard butter version as most other beard butters are.<br /><br />I had been looking at purchasing a beard butter  for a while from Detroit because I liked the fragrances I read that were used. I had no real idea what they’d smell as most folks who use beard products may understand. Also, fragrances can often be way too strong and these all mostly seemed just right. It stinks when you spend a bunch of money that is going to be on your face all day/night and turns out it is awful smelling, triggers migraines, etc. … this sample pack helps mitigate waste to find your favorite scents and the price seems reasonable.<br /><br />With all that said, most of the fragrances smell mature and very nice. I was pleasantly surprised given how much beard products, scents, and companies I’ve tried.<br /><br />For now, Detroit is my favorite company for beard moisturizers.\n",
      "12102->need manual for this | 3 | 0 | I think price is ok, and fact that it can be nearly permanent can be awesome,<br />but there is no manual included in this product at all. I have used the one time 3 blades shaver,<br />but this one is a bit hard to use. I tried using it like other razor/shaver, but it won't work.<br />can somebody please tell how it works? I really like the product, and quality, but it is not like any other<br />normal razor that I used before. Price was ok, and quality is great, but they definitely need to<br />tell customers some tip for using their product. It was with box, and only product, no manuals included.<br />Overall, other than manual, I really like the products, but no manuals took away the 2 stars.\n",
      "12123->Great compact unit -- not as strong as others though | 4 | 0 | Our last water flosser died -- so it was time for a replacement. This unit is VERY compact, I was actually shocked when it came because I thought there was no way it could fit in there. Lo and behold -- it did! Although this is a permanent fixture on our sink, it could easily travel with us if we went anywhere. Being a compact, travel-friendly water flosser I was surprised at how much volume it can hold. If you can't tell, I'm really impressed by the compact ability of this water flosser.<br /><br />It comes with a variety of tips, enough to make this usable for a couple as my husband and I share it. It is very easy to use, the one call out if you have a more traditional water flosser is that this is a rechargeable unit! It comes with a charging cord (USB), but no base -- so you'll have to grab one of your existing ones and let this charge for about 8 hours -- so you can't use it straight out of the box.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that even at maximum pressure it is not as strong as our previous one. It does work well enough to get any extra stuff out of your teeth after brushing, however, it is not the strongest water flosser -- my husband would like something a bit more strong, but that is really the only complaint we have!\n",
      "12125->One Broken Lid Out Of Three... | 2 | 0 | These are decent enough and I love the twist up lid rather than the ones with the little caps that are so easy to lose. However, one of my lids is defective so I had to remove one star. I'm hoping to find another that matches the size.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />As it turns out, one lid was broken and another didn't fit properly but, because I haven't needed it right away, I didn't find that out until I turned it to shake it and it leaked oil all over my clothes after having sealed it, or so I thought.<br /><br />I asked the company what they could do about it. They wanted photos but have no way to receive them since they don't use regular means to communicate like other sellers. So, that was a bust.<br /><br />I asked them to just send me two working twist top lids as the bottles were fine and returning them would be as hassle at this point since 2 have stuff in them even though I van only one properly... They did a song and a dance and wanted me to jump through hoops just to get some lids for their defective item that I could have just rated lowly and returned.<br /><br />So, I'm changing my rating. They would have been a 5 if they'd all been in perfect, usable condition. One out of three and poor customer service is unacceptable!\n",
      "12143->Light & pleasant moisturizer, but nothing really sets it apart from others. | 4 | 0 | This is a pleasant to use product: it goes on smoothly; it soaks in quickly; it doesn’t irritate; it’s light to the feel both during the application process and once it’s on the skin; the scent is nice and dissipates quickly; the amount used for one application to face and neck is economical (about three pumps); and the product feels good on the skin, even the eye area.<br /><br />Having said all that, there is nothing particularly outstanding about the product which, at this price point, I would expect. My skin is not irritated but neither is it improved after nearly half a bottle’s worth of use. It is a good, light, daytime moisturizer, but I can find nothing to set it apart from other moisturizers both more and less expensive.\n",
      "12158->Pretty but not effective | 3 | 0 | While the stickers themselves are adorable they are actually pretty slick and don't keep me or my child from sliding around.  The bottom of my tub came with a better non-slip tread than these stickers have.<br /><br />I would recommend these more for decorating the side of the tub rather than using them as a non-slip pad.\n",
      "12189->Best yet from Phillips/Norelco. | 5 | 0 | Yes, it's true. This is a good switch from even the latest Gillette multi-blade wonder. Even the replacement lotion (or gel) cartridges are much cheaper than those blades or the multi-pack (whole plastic ones with a handle) throws-away.<br /><br />I recommend spreading the lotion or gel with a finger rather than relying on the 'glide rings' as this will make it go further. Also, any basic model without the bells and whistles will serve you just as well.<br /><br />I suffer from a heavy growth/sensitive skin combination, and find this razor to be the best Phillips/Norelco device, yet.<br /><br /> I bought mine about eight months ago, and even shave my head with it. Not quite as close as the 'naked' blade, but as mine grows to stubble within a few hours - who cares? My wife LOVES it, too - and can't stop kissing and sniffing my face and head after I shave!<br /><br />Now for the going shopping bit:<br /><br /> I highly suggest going for a factory refurbished unit. This is by far the best value for your money at about one third the  price of a new one. I found mine at Goodmans (also available through Amazon). These are simply shavers that someone has tried and returned because it didn't suit them. Mine is absolutely like brand new, and arrived in the same sealed packaging as a 'new' one. Obviously the heads and cutters have been replaced, making them perfectly clean and safe.<br /><br />Yaba-daba-do. I'm a very happy camper (shaving camper, that is)!<br /><br />Bon chance, fellow hairy's..\n",
      "12200->Just meh | 1 | 0 | It's very easy to use but never set properly I ended up having to file it down and just put a tip coat over the dip powder.<br /><br />Update I decided to try again thinking I messed up somehow and again the top coat never sets properly. I again had to use polish remover to get the goo off and then just applied a clear to coat of my own and it looks much better. Try another brand slip this one\n",
      "12237->And pumping... | 3 | 0 | The bottle is cute. Love the pink. Unfortunately, the bottle is very cheaply made. Felt and looked like something that would be purchased at a swap meet. I had a very hard time getting anything to come out. I pumped and pumped and pumped and pumped....and pumped. This was tasking and quite irritating. When the serum finally came through it was watery. I enjoyed the scent.  It was crisp, light and fruity. Not sure how long I have to use this to see any changes. I will continue to use and update my review after more time has passed.<br />I was given this vitamin c serum at discount to review. This is my honest and unbiased opinion.\n",
      "12249->The best toothbrush I ever had | 5 | 0 | I love this toothbrush. It is the most effective brush I ever had.<br />The only thing I do not care for is it pauses briefly every 45 seconds or so and this aggravates me.\n",
      "12256->Vile | 1 | 0 | When you first put this on it's delightful, a bouquet of various flowers.<br />After one hour it becomes Eau de Vampire Breath, truly horrible. It doesn't fade away either. It stays as strong so you have to scrub it off with soap and water.<br />Is absolutely vile. Just because it's inexpensive, it shouldn't make you sick.<br />I'm so glad I only bought the sample and lost $10.\n",
      "12290->The most important thing: kids love these! | 5 | 0 | When kids love them they WANT to brush!<br />They clean well and keep the color.<br /><br />They do have to be replaced every 2 months.\n",
      "12303->Manufacturing Issues | 2 | 0 | One keeps making noise when it bumps together .. the other fits flush and made no noise.<br />. No matter how in tried to adjust the two pieces kept making  noise during wear.\n",
      "12304->Nothing Rosy Here! | 1 | 0 | 🛑STOP🤚<br />IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EVEN A HINT OF COLOR, FORGET A \"ROSY\" COLOR,  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.<br />Its just a Vaseline lipgloss. There is no color whatsoever!!!<br />The only thing rosy about this item is the color of the tube. The worst part is, you'll  have to open it up to examine the color, to know that! Once you open it, you can't return it.\n",
      "12335->Works well but didn't like the dispenser | 4 | 0 | This combined with the moisturizer has made my skin absolutely glow. I've been using just one pump for my whole face and neck both morning and night.<br />The scent in the serum is so light that it doesn't cause any irritation to my skin which is so rare.<br />The packaging is beautiful and looks gorgeous on my countertop. I do however have some trouble with the dispenser pump because it gets finicky and will only pump out product from one side. The component is made of plastic which is why I'm not giving it five stars. For the price you would expect glass or some sort of refill that was more eco friendly.<br />For those that have arthritis, the pump can be tricky to use because you have to press down fairly hard. Hopefully this is fixed in the future because it's a lovely product.\n",
      "12337->i like this sample kit for trying the different colors and ... | 4 | 0 | i like this sample kit for trying the different colors and the brushes were wonderful. a very good deal for this product.<br />But as it get older now…it becomes harder to deal with very small containers.\n",
      "12346->Doesn't hang on well but does the job. | 4 | 0 | I bought this to replace my Deva made diffuser, which was cracking with age and didn't fit the new dryer.<br /><br />Well, this one doesn't either, it doesn't have a secure connection.  But I saved the very wide rubber band from the Deva one and used it to secure this diffuser and it's working.<br /><br />More air comes out of the back of the hand than the front, which is odd, but it does reach into the hair to dry the interior, which is the main reason I like this type of diffuser.<br /><br />So, not perfect but fine for the price.\n",

      "12352->Nauseating | 2 | 0 | I wore the lavender scent with a single mask to a doctor's appointment, minutes into the ride there, the smell was noticable but not uncomfortable. Once inside with the doctor thirty minutes had past and the smell was becoming stronger. The more I spoke doing my visit the smell became nauseating, I decided to remove the scent.<br />Doesn't pass the smell test for me, no pun intended.<br />I'll stick with a melting peppermint ball.\n",

      "12366->Great for press on nails. | 4 | 0 | It was exactly as I expected. I wish it was three sets of stars. I really don't like the gray at all. The packaging was very nice and neat. It has a strong oder when it's first opened, but it fades away after a couple of minutes, much like regular nail polish.<br /><br />The wraps were very easy to apply on the press on nails that I bought. I am very pleased with my purchase. I definitely recommend purchasing these nail wraps. I would have given it five stars if they were all space patterns.\n",
      "12378->Very mini | 4 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:21ddac411e00668aac7eceb5ed24668f]] Nice little machine. It doesn’t come with styling ideas or anything so I don’t know if it can do something other than crimp hair. Anyways this style of wave is the closest to my natural hair without styling so It takes like 35 minutes to finish my hair.<br />It’s very easy to use and comes only with on and off button, you cannot set the heat.\n",

      "12423->BAD SEED | 1 | 0 | COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED!<br />The first ingredient is WATER!<br />This is supposed to be for Ethnic Hair?<br />H2O is contraindicated, at least for my ethnic hair1<br />Perhaps that is why this product is advertised for &#34;heat treated hair&#34; and<br />then a flat iron is required after use.  I thought this product would add sheen, etc.\n",
      "12425->Wax and perfume? | 2 | 0 | Not around my eyes!  Perfumey, some menthol, waxy chunks that wont melt.<br />Now using it on cuticles and my knees.\n",
      "12427->smells | 4 | 0 | I like this brush.  It is very stiff, but massages your scalp while brushing.  I really feel the nylon bristles more than the boar bristles.  Truthfully, I can't say there are any boar bristles.  But is has nice cushioning and is a typical paddle style brush and seems well made.<br /><br />The rubber base the the brush does have the rubber odor that will hopefully go away soon.\n",
      "12432->Great! | 4 | 0 | Bigger than I expected which is great because I have a lot of hair and long ,  It's a good quality plastic.<br />I wouldn't recommend for short hair, because the clips are really big / long\n",
      "12446->Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet ceda | 5 | 0 | I'm a bit of a hair product snob. Years of coloring has damaged my hair badly so I am very picky what I use on it.<br /><br />Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet cedar.<br /><br />The shampoo has a medium lather. I used 10 pumps as I have think and mid length hair. I also left the shampoo in my hair for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />After washing my hair was not greasy or heavy from residue. There was definitely a shine but no oily feel.<br /><br />I have oily roots and this shampoo cleaned my hair with easy while leaving it evenly moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased and I definitely will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item for free. My review and assessment is my own after personal use and has not been influenced or compensated.\n",
      "12465->Love all the sizes but I love the 6mm best. | 5 | 0 | These Nail Art Brushes are pretty. I love the shape of the handle and the color. I like the 6mm size best.<br /><br />The box comes with 6 brushes. Each brush is a different size from 6mm to 11mm. There are no instructions for cleaning included.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Nail Art Brushes to family and friends.\n",
      "12493->B- | 2 | 0 | This is alright.<br />I thought it would be like my previous trimmer but have the vacuum so I don't make a mess.<br /><br />Turns out the vacuum is a great feature but it doesn't cut as well as my  beard trimmer.<br /><br />Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain \"vanilla\" Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc.\n",

      "12507->Amazing Wig! | 3 | 0 | I love this hair. It’s very soft and the cap construction is amazing. It’s big head friendly, but it has combs and an adjustable strap, so it fits well on my relatively small head. This wig is thick! The unit comes preplucked, it’s very much beginner friendly. Also, it came with a few gifts! Wore it all day, no tangling at all. Will order more soon.<br /><br />One Month Update:<br />The wig is shedding quite a bit. It now looks like 120% density. The ends started fraying although I’ve been applying oil to this unit. It’s not a bad wig but I question how long it could last and the quality of the hair. Still pretty soft but tangling a lot more.\n",
      "12528->So many butterflies it's hard to choose! 5 stars ✨ | 5 | 0 | Wow! This set comes with so many different types of butterflies. I love how the butterfly stickers come in so many different colors that no matter what color polish should you choose to wear, there are so many butterflies that will go with it. Some of my favorite ones are the butterfly outlines that are shiny or holographic. Most of the color ones also shimmer, which is so beautiful.<br />I like that there are butterflies that are flying sideways and also complete butterflies. It gives nail art a lot more interest. Having the glitter butterflies is a bonus to play around with encapsulating. With this sticker and glitter kit, there are so many nail art designs you can create. I've done several, but my mind is filled with endless possibilities. Highly recommended! 5 stars ✨\n",
      "12574->Attractive Comb, Works On My Long & Short Haired Cats (Long sparse teeth comb) | 4 | 0 | I ordered the \" Long sparse teeth comb\" with my long haired cat in mind. I was worried the teeth would be too far apart, they're not. What is surprising is that this even works on my short haired cats. It pulls out loose fur just fine & my cats enjoy the way it feels. It does pull my long haired cats fur. She doesn't put up a fuss. Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome. But for a casual grab to comb a visiting fur baby while I'm on the couch - it's purrfect!<br /><br />Made in China.\n",

      "12645->Nice tiny bottles but horrible brush!!! The nail polish doesn't last a week on my hands. | 3 | 0 | The colors are beautiful 😍 but the quality of the brush is horrible. The brush is too big and narrow for the small tiny bottle of nail polish. These bottles are mini sizes and cute. I bought them in the meantime because here in NYC everything is closed and I need to lift up my spirit asap. Having my nails not done wasn't helping at all with this quarantine situation. The color and thickness of the liquid colors are ok but the brush is a big NO.<br /><br />Update:<br />The color chips within hours of getting my nails done. I use a natural and organic base coat and top coat and still the nail polish doesn't last. I'm disappointed because I like the colors.  I use gloves to do dishes and when I am cleaning the house.  The nail polish started to chip within two days.  I am so disappointed because the colors are gorgeous.\n",
      "12660->Very disappointed customer | 1 | 0 | When I placed my order I wanted a certain scent. The scent that was sent to me is not what I ordered. When my package arrived a couple of the bottles top were busted/broken and wasted all in the box all over. I was disappointed twice with not getting what I ordered and was expecting and product busted and wasted all in the box:(<br />I’ve always loved caress products because I could only use certain products and scents on my body. I never had this scent and it’s not the same. I wouldn’t never ordered six bottles of a scent I never tried before:(<br />I should’ve been informed my scent was out and would I like another scent instead because I wasn’t inspecting the new scent to come.\n",

      "12695->A gentle shave | 3 | 0 | This is my first time trying out an electric razor.<br />I used it to shave my arm pits and my legs. I think overall it did an okay job but I didn't get quite as close of a shave as I do when I use a regular razor and shaving cream. Part of this may have been due to user error/just not being used to this method.<br /><br />Overall, it was comfortable to use. It is nice and lightweight. It didn't cause any razor burn.<br /><br />I think I still feel more comfortable using a traditional razor on my legs as far as getting a close shave, but I plan to continue to use this for my armpits and bikini area because I read online that this type of razor is less likely to contribute to ingrown hairs and overall be gentler on the skin.\n",

      "12737->Tastes bad, Messy | 4 | 0 | I started seeking out this product when, even after using petroleum jelly or chapstick on my lips overnight, I still awoke with chapped lips.<br /><br />I wanted to like this product because it was cheaper than the alternative.  But alas, this product was more liquid that I expected.  And, applying essentially a pink oil from my jar is not my preference.  I would have preferred something in a tube.  I also did not like the fact that it tastes especially bad.<br /><br />I prefer the version advertised by Avashine - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WG448FM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1.\n",
      "12740->It's worth trying | 4 | 0 | This is an interesting way to get some very nice curls in your hair. It’s a long soft rod type thing. The material is the usual you’d get for a curler wrapped in silk. It’s all bendy and what you do is sort of braid your hair onto/with this. After that, you use the included scrunchies to hold it in place at the bottom.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good but, maybe it was just me, it was difficult to get my hair twisted correctly onto the rod. My hair is long, reaching about mid back and perfectly straight. If you get it on there right, it comes out looking very nice. It just takes a whole lot of practice. Also, as a side note, if your hair is a little damp, it works better.<br /><br />This comes with the main curler, two large scrunchies, two smaller scrunchies, two hair clips, and a nice bag to keep everything in. The scrunchies are silk.<br /><br />This works nicely and it’s worth trying out if you want heatless curls. For me it was difficult to get the knack of but if you are good with hair, which I am just not, you might find it quite easy from the start.\n",
      "12741->Good enough for a last choice….. | 2 | 0 | A person can’t expect much from cotton pads right?<br /><br />True, but these rounds are rather thin.  Not a lot of cotton/puff/padding in there.<br /><br />Would buy again if no other choice, but being so thin makes them a NO, on my list.<br /><br />Not a paid/compensated reviewer.  Wish I was!<br /><br />David\n",
      "12760->I like them. You might, too. | 4 | 0 | Durability is a problem, as the ones I’ve used are already longer than the ones I haven’t.<br />Stretch: plenty of that.<br />They were cheap so I have to say they’re pretty good value for money.<br /><br />I like these because I can wrap them very, very tightly around my hair, much more than ordinary elastics.<br /><br />I didn’t like how the little hooks are a little bit scratchy, and they also catch in clothing and things.\n",
      "12772->Made my beard smell like mint. | 2 | 0 | Stuff smells great but in no way does this balm have any \"shaping\" or \"holding\" properties. I have a full beard that can get quite wiry at times as my beard hair is thick. This stuff did nothing but make it shiny and smell like mint (which was a bonus so 2 stars for that).<br /><br />If you're looking for something to keep your beard looking groomed and in place and have similar beard type to mine, keep looking.\n",
      "12777->Nice toothbrush | 5 | 0 | Even though he already has a more expensive Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush that he keeps in the medicine cabinet, I bought this inexpensive electric toothbrush for my husband - one that he could keep in the shower (I've always liked having the option to brush my teeth while taking a shower).<br /><br />I asked him how he likes this new toothbrush and he says it is really great.  In fact, he says he somewhat prefers it to his other rechargeable toothbrush because this one has a really comfortable brushing speed and is easy to hold onto.<br /><br />Thus, it is a nice inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush and at this time he would recommend it.  However, we haven't had it long enough to determine how well the battery lasts.  The other Oral-B that he he's had for years (probably 7-10 years) is still amazingly working well with the original battery; yet that toothbrush was probably over $50 at the time.\n",
      "12788->Well made, but not useful for my beard | 4 | 0 | This was a bit of a gamble on my part. I have a scraggly beard and hoped to tame it somewhat with this flat iron. That didn't really work very well, but the iron itself works fine (and straightened the hair on my head). This is an attractive little unit that heats up quickly (if you touch it to test, you'll likely regret it).  The single control is a bit inexact; it clicks several times making you somewhat unsure what's going on. Also, the variable temperature is somewhat of a guessing game - you know the high and low temperatures, but not exactly what's going on in between.<br /><br />Still, it works and works easily, and even comes with a nice little travel bag.  So if you're NOT trying to tame a beard, this should work fine for you.\n",
      "12794->Baby soft lips | 4 | 0 | I like the scent, makes my lips feel soft & moisturized after immediate use. I like using it before applying lip stick, also a few times a week just to keep my lips soft.<br />This scrub is where a little will go a long way. You don't need to use much, which is great.\n",
      "12816->Great quality | 5 | 0 | The color of the wig is as described.<br />It does not tangle easily like other wigs I have bought before.<br />Great length and pretty waves.\n",
      "12863->Eh | 3 | 0 | I thought these were really neat at 1st.<br /><br />You get a bunch which is nice. I did it the 1st one and was surprised how easy it came to me.<br />Tried it the 2nd time and my hair got stuck. I guess it was luck of the draw.<br />Too much work for mediocre wave that it leaves. It's great to not have to use 2 hot product (blow dryer and then curler) but that would be the only plus.\n",
      "12881->Very moisturizing, but leaves too much oil behind. 3.5 stars ✨ | 4 | 0 | The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.\n",
      "12912->wipes are ok. Convenient, non irritating, effective at quick clean up | 3 | 0 | This review is for the foot wipes only. I was intrigued as I do foot masks once a month, and I am always otherwise giving my feet attention every night. Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.\n",
      "12915->Realy nice touch lamp. | 5 | 0 | I love my new lamp.  I have a cowboys (western) one and I needed another one to match but I got this Native American (Indian) one.  So now I have a cowboys and Indians lamps in my living room.  I love the touch lamps.<br />My only complaint is that when I got it there were little slivers of metal poking up in the middle of the circles (where I would touch it to turn it on).  I just used a pair of pliers and pinched them off.  It is great now.\n",
      "12936->Might be ok to give eye tats a try | 2 | 0 | Many of these appear to be the same as other designs I’ve purchased individually for $2 or more. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. These look like low quality prints from a printer in need of a new toner cartridge. Many of the black tats are faded with a gray or reddish tone, and the “print” is uneven and/or blurry. They have a chemical smell that made me apprehensive about putting them on my face, but I tried them anyway. These do not stick as well as others - making application a little hairy. After application they look somewhat like a thin plastic sheet, aren’t as smooth as I’d like, and seem inclined to peel up at the edges. I have not experienced these problems with others, like the “Eye Rock” tats these may be attempting to mimic. On the plus side, they don’t seem to have irritated the sensitive skin around my eyes.<br /><br />If you just want to fool around and will only keep them on for a short time, these might be worth a try. It takes me some effort to plan, line up, and apply an eye tat, and I usually keep them on for several days. These aren’t worth it for me.\n",
      "12950->Non absorbent!  Very small ! | 1 | 0 | The fabric is not absorbent!<br />And might fit but very small and uncomfortable!  Lots of other brands are much better!\n",
      "12958->No Volume | 2 | 0 | I have to use this type of mascara due to allergies. This has no volume no matter how many times<br />I put it on.\n",
      "12963->Good overall ,but... | 4 | 0 | Good overall ,but not when using wireless. It's too weak. One overnight Charge is enough to shave only 1.5 legs (forget about head haircut/do).<br />Battery is the worst,but with wall plug it will do any job easier.<br />The good thing though if ur doing any cutting/shaving-it's pain free,it doesn't rip out your hair follicles;)<br />One star fell out of the battery quality;(\n",
      "12969->Spikes? What Spikes? | 3 | 0 | I bought this stuff on a whim and after using it for a while, I would say that I wish I had just gotten the Spiking Glue instead. The benefits of this wax product is that it doesn't seem to flake, it washes out very easily, and it seems to be very good at providing texture to your hair style. The downside for me is that for something called &#34;Spiking Wax&#34;, it doesn't seem to do a good job at all when it comes to creating or holding spikes. I found my hair regularly coming back down by the end of a work day, which might look more natural in the end, but just wasn't what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to create a textured look, this will probably work well.<br />If you're looking for spikes and are hoping that you can do it without the flakes or impossible-to-wash-out product, then this product just seems to be proof that you can't have your cake and eat it, too.\n",
      "12983->Non drying cleansing balm | 4 | 0 | Pros<br />The scent is a light herbal smell that I really like<br />Don’t dry out my skin<br />I like the flip top instead of the twist off cap like some others<br />Cons<br />Doesn’t get off waterproof Makeup that easily I have to scrub a little bit<br />Leaves a milky texture on your skin afterwards maybe this isn’t a con though\n",
      "12987->It's a Ok Curling Wand Set | 4 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:2f0e21224710daeaf4cb2ff1e908500f]] Is a nice Curling wand set and I love the Vibrant pink color. This Curling wand did curl my hair but it was more of a wavy kind of curl which they still looked cute but I was looking more for a define curl. This set brings 5 different size barrels so you do get alot for the price, however I did not like to much the material because is all plastic for except the barrels and it does not seem to durable.<br />I did get this Curling wand at discount price in exchange of a honest review.\n",
      "12990->Beautiful gift, relaxing tool | 5 | 0 | I absolutely loved the jade roller and the scraping tool! It feels very gentle on your face and your neck, and there are instructions inside the box on how to use the rose quartz roller, with video links and care instructions for the natural rose quartz (it says jade, but this is rose quartz).<br />I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some conflicting information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the bottom part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll downward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a great massaging, relaxing, and skin care tool that looks beautiful.\n",
      "12996->Very nice clip & hair tie set but clips will break easily; one broke immediately out of the package | 3 | 0 | This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. I particularly love the blue clips. Unfortunately, the first blue one I tried broke immediately as can be seen in the photo. At least I have one blue left. The clips are strong and do  hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional.<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. I'm definitely annoyed about the one clip that broke.\n",
      "13002->VERY FEW PIECES | 1 | 0 | I’ve been buying Kiss nails since Covid started two years ago and everything shut down.<br />The French tips I’ve been buying for two years are amazing so I thought I would try another color. WRONG.<br />These nails have basically no size range whatsoever and you just sort of try to find a nail that kinda fits, but not really.<br />The Kiss French tip nails I’ve been using for two solid years have so many sizes and I can actually get two full sets from one purchase.<br />These? You can’t even get ONE set that fits your nails.<br />Returning for a full refund - waste of time and money.<br />SO DISAPPOINTED.\n",
      "13019->Cute concept, but prongs are very hard and sharp, and may injure cat's eyes | 2 | 0 | I guess I was expecting this to be rubber or silicone, like some of the other cat grooming brushes I have.  It's rigid plastic, with very sharp points.  My cat has a different wall brush with bristles that she loves, but she doesn't like this one, maybe because the points are too sharp, or they're pointing different directions and are different lengths.  If not mounted on the wall, it's really not comfortable for a human to hold or use on the pet as the shape is awkward and there's no handle.  I would be very concerned about using this as a brush near a pet's face as the odd shape makes it hard to control, and the sharp points could injure a pet's eyes.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMENDED\n",

      "13044->Hard as a rock | 2 | 0 | The product arrived as scheduled, however, it was leaking through the packaging, messy.  The coconut smelled the best, the others were just so-so, not really that fragrant. Four jars come in the purchase which I used one at a time. By the time I got to jar number<br />three, it was as hard as a brick. It’s not very comfortable when you have to break up the salts while you’re trying to shower.  I guess it got hard because of all the leakage during transport. I will not purchase this product again, I’ll stick with my sugar scrubs.\n",
      "13081->Scent is over-powering | 2 | 0 | Love SheaMoisture products and its story, but the Lavender & Orchid scent is so over-powering considering the delicate fragrances.<br />I tried both a few times and couldn't take it. Struggled finding someone to take it off my hands, so wound up throwing it out.<br /><br />Please avoid if you like a light, Lavender scent.<br />Buy in bulk if you enjoy being smacked in the face or smacking others in the face with the smell\n",
      "13116->EASY TO USE, SUPER EASY TO CLEAN! | 5 | 0 | The best part about this brush is that you push the button on top, the teeth retract, and you just wipe off the fur!  Push the button again, slide it forward, and the teeth lock in place, ready to start grooming.<br /><br />I have always liked slicker brushes for grooming short haired cats and as a way to control the shed on longer haired dogs, but it was almost impossible to clean out all of the fur.  The retractable pins solve the problem!  This brush is even easy to use with arthritic hands!<br /><br />My Siamese cat with short, thick fur, adores this brush!  Since he doesn’t groom a lot, I need to.  My medium to long haired cat doesn’t like any brush, but tolerated this one.\n",
      "13133->This is a good blush.  Don't be put off by bright colors - they calm down on your face. | 4 | 0 | It's not anyone's fault but I have a difficult time with any blush staying on my very dry face.  I used to wear this and it worked beautifully for me so I'm assuming that once I get my dry skin under control, it will work as well as it always has.<br /><br />This was a Genuine product and not out of date.  Shipping was as promised and it was well-packaged.\n",
      "13151->You get what you pay for | 4 | 0 | Glad I tried this one.  Works well with my f1 bernedoodle.  Can't use on my f1b, too curly, won't go through her hair.  Love the self cleaning feature.<br />After using for a few mo ths had to take away a star.  The brushing needles started bending and not going back into place,  then the whole thing fell apart.  I was able to put it back together, but its just not the same.  Will not be purchasing again.\n",
      "13164->Hard to separate | 4 | 0 | Review for Specific Beauty Skin Brightening Pads, Skin Smoothing for more Even Texture & Tone- Dark Spot Fading Kojic Acid & Licorice 90 X 2 180 Pads<br /><br />I received on jar of skin brightening pads. Sometimes only partial orders are received by reviewers in the Vine program so I was not concerned with that. However, there is another reviewer that also only received one jar so I felt that I should mention that.<br /><br />My jar arrived with a security seal beneath the lid. Once removed, I was able to pull out a few pads. I found it difficult to separate them so that I only got one to use on my face. It turns out that every time I use these, I have to fight to get them apart and make sure I am only using one.<br /><br />Once I have separated out one pad, I like how they work. They are quick to use and they do a nice job on my skin. My skin has a tingling sensation when it comes in contact with the pads. This quickly passes. I use the pads after washing my face and after use, I apply a serum. My skin feels smooth and soft.\n",

      "13211->Love and Hate this Scrub | 3 | 0 | I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this scrub. What I LOVE about it is the delicious, robust coffee scent. It is STRONG and packs a powerful punch in the morning, which helps to wake me up. I also love the serious grit it has to it. The texture varies from fine grounds to courser grounds, with a higher ratio of course grounds. Each scrub feels like it's getting deep into my skin. I feel like I'm scrubbing off layers of dead skin, dirt, grime, etc. when I'm using this. My skin feels smoother and softer after I use this scrub. I apply lotion straight out of the shower and my body is soft as a cloud!<br /><br />What I sort of hate about this product is how messy it is. It just falls apart and gets everywhere. I included photos of what a hot mess my sink and shower look like after using it. Other scrubs I've used in the past have some agent that keeps them together to prevent it from going everywhere, but this doesn't. One I tried recently that I loved was JOON X MOON (https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Exfoliating-Moisturizing-Nourish-Essential/dp/B0876GX6MQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=moon+cube+body+scrub&qid=1600826357&sr=8-2), and that is in cube form to start, then breaks down to scrub as you rub it and use water.  It does an incredible job of exfoliating without making a mess of my small shower. If you're not into the cube thing, I also like stuff that B&BW makes and they sell it on Amazon. It's has a paste-like consistency and does a good job at making your skin feel soft like a baby! Here is a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy scrub - I loooove this one: https://www.amazon.com/Bath-Body-Works-AROMATHERAPY-Eucalyptus/dp/B005LZUP36/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=sugar+scrub&qid=1600826921&sr=8-14<br /><br />The other thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the packaging. I have a tiny shower, so it is impossible to take anything in there without getting wet. Every time I take this into the shower, I'm nervous the bag will get soaked and ruin it. There is a waxy coat applied to the bag, which helps protect it, but it still doesn't give me as much confidence as something like a glass jar or tin would. Ideally, the scrub wouldn't get soaked until I'm ready to use it. It has held up through 3 uses so far but I may transfer it into a mason jar and store it that way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bummed me out was that is stained my clothes!!! I towel dried after shower, put on moisturizer, then light gray leggings. There must have been a tiny amount of residule coffee scrub because it stained my leggings!!<br /><br />Overall, a decent scrub to try. Not my favorite scrub, since it stained my clothes and made my shower a mess.\n",

It should come with a pump. Calling it a cream is false advertising.<br />I am very unhappy to have spent $40 on this and am back on the hunt for an actual cream.\n",
      "13241->Very effective face hair trimmer | 4 | 0 | I like it.  It cuts well.  The little vacuum works for the most part.  It does leave some hairs in the sink still, but just a bit and little enough to wash down the sink.<br /><br />The clean-out and length of cut adjustment are easy enough to use.  The unit seems sturdy and it has plenty of battery life for me.<br /><br />The head is large enough that it does get cumbersome up under the nose.  It's not ineffective, but just a little harder to get the hairs close to the nose.\n",
      "13253->So much fun! | 5 | 0 | My kids and I have been doing a lot of crafting which involves placing tiny sequins and gems on to small painted wooden or clay items, and so while we are not using these for the intended purpose of going on nails, we have been going through these quickly using tweezers to get them out and apply to our craft projects.<br /><br />I've been really impressed with the variety of the sequins, the quality level of them with the thickness and color reflectivity being great, and the quantity given. We all really love these beautiful butterflies and how vivid and fun they are.\n",
      "13255->Dried my hair out - HORRIBLY | 1 | 0 | I was excited to try the product. Please note, I bought this through their website, the specific type based on professional recommendation, this was not an amazon purchase - but I can't review there. I noticed I had to use a lot of product, and even then my hair looked weird. Then i was taught that you use a little, add water a few times and then rinse under cool - well that has turned into a disaster. Some tangles have been so awful that I had to cut them out.<br /><br />I'm about to throw out half a really expensive bottle because my hair is dry, tangly, frizzy. Some of us don't want, or have time, to use 3 or 4 products to make our hair look great, much less figure out a \"code\" to get conditioner in and out of hair.<br /><br />I know this product works amazing for several people. But if you are a person it doesn't work for, you'll know in a few uses. Don't force the issue on your hair.\n",
      "13278->Multiple uses for cold therapy | 5 | 0 | This little tool is going to see many types of use in my home. I suffer from migraines, so cold therapy is my go to for those. In addition to headaches, we also have out share of muscle aches and bumps and bruises. This tool will be great for giving those localized attention without the bulk of an ice pack. We can also control the pressure applied.<br /><br />The two heads are easily popped on and off. It's nice that you get two, because you can always have a spare in the freezer, and switch them out when needed. This is also going to be a great cool down tool for my husband after doing yardwork. The Texas sun is brutal in the summertime. Applying this to his face and the back of his neck is going to be a real treat.

NOTE: There is an easy-to-remove protective film covering the mirror -- some may mistaken it for poor mirror quality. Not so.<br /><br />Since it's plastic, I don't have to worry about it shattering should it ever be dropped. I also like that it's fairly large so you definitely see more of your reflection.<br /><br />No fogging issues yet. But no matter. I'd just resort to the old swim goggle trick: a little bit of spit always does the trick. It also helps to keep the mirror clean of soap scum.\n",

Really. | 5 | 0 | Every other self tanner, even ones that were marketed as having no scent, had that awful, make you sick to your stomach odor. Except this one.<br /><br />I am not sure how they do it but they did it.<br /><br />And, it's a great product. It works fast. I typically put it on after I towel dry from the shower, then wait a few minutes while I brush my teeth. The key to a non-streaky appearance is to use a mitt!!! This one came with a soft velour mitt and it works wonders. I still get spots that I miss but that is due to user error - and it would be easier to spot these gaps if this tanner was tinted a little bit more. I wouldn't take a full star off for that but I would love it even more if it was easier to see where I had already put it on.<br /><br />It arrived super fast and sealed, not leaking out like with many other products.<br /><br />It lasts only about 2-3 days, and it's a lot thinner than other tanners - it's not a cream, much more of a lotion and a tiny bit too liquidy at that. But, overall i love it.\n",
      "13400->Slippery. Brace yourself. | 1 | 0 | I guess if you are laying down in the tub and scrubbing then it might work, no, it still wouldn't. The problem I had was while the suctions were firmly stuck to the tub floor, the entire product slid and scooted around the tub. So it was ridiculously difficult to unsuction it from the floor after showering, but the darn thing moved when trying to scrub the heel. I got this product for my mom, because a chiropractor suggested it for the stimulation to the feet for elderly who are unable to bend down. I guess it sort of scrubbed the top of my foot a little, but it did absolutely nothing for the heel, the gnarly part that actually needs the scrubbing, since it moved so much. I asked my mom what she thought and she said \"definitely not enough strength to get any real stimulation from it.\"<br /><br />It's also ginormous to have in the bath.\n",

I like this companies products especially their mascara with the green top and tan cylindrical tube.<br /><br />For this product I am writing a review on. The mascara is gummy, does not spread well and takes a long time to dry. The applicator it comes with is absolutely the worst design I have seen. one positive thing about it is that it is very black. Which I do like.<br /><br />This product definitely does not work for me, nor would I suggest anyone to use it.\n",
      "13415->A good starter set -- but it's ONLY a starter set | 4 | 0 | This is a good starter set. It features the required elements for acrylic nails. It comes with a small, USB powered, nail dryer that emits UV and enables the nail coatings to harden.<br /><br />There’s enough here to get you started on your journey away from the nail salon and into home nail maintenance.<br />By now, because of Covid-19, the chances are high that your fancy acrylic or gel nails have already grown out, leaving you with your own nails. If you’re not happy with the ‘native’ appearance of your nails, and choose to use gel polish to restore them to look like you had them done at a salon, this kit may be useful.<br /><br />The nail dryer is small – so you can’t do more than a finger or two at a time. You’ll probably have to get polish or powder to give you the finish that you want—but this set will get you started…<br /><br />It’s a pretty good starter kit, but if you’re serious about your nails, you’ll probably want a larger nail dryer, and more nail products. (A nail drill – while scary and potentially dangerous – can be helpful for removing your nails, if you made a mistake, or if you want to change colors).\n",
      "13454->Not for Acetone! | 2 | 0 | It should say in the description  , not to be used for Acetone.<br />I like the size and color , thought give it a try. It turned blurry as soon as I filled the bottle with Acetone , not sure it will leak over time.\n",
      "13456->One Star | 1 | 0 | Not worth it<br />Overpriced\n",
      "13463->Beautiful but isn't strip but instead string. | 5 | 0 | These are very much for the more experienced eyelash wearer as they only have a tiny string to work with and not a strip. So I have to say that if you can't work with just string lashes then do not get these. However, if you don't mind then these are great. They look beautiful and blend in so well that people honestly can't tell they are false lashes.<br /><br />I honestly love them and they look very natural and beautiful. Would be happy to buy more later on.\n",
      "13470->Fine for the money I guess | 3 | 0 | So it's affordable. Based on the price I guess I can't complain so far.<br /><br />However, I really don't like the lack of flexibility on the angles. You don't have many options.<br /><br />Even the cheap ones that HP had for their old Touchpad worked out better for me.<br /><br />It will do the job but not sure it might not have been worth coughing up the money for something higher end.\n",
      "13471->Gave it a chance. Great deal & does work but feels weird during application. It's not an item I'd reorder. | 3 | 0 | The chapstick inside is nice and I understand the reason for the flat, square tubes, but I gotta say that shape makes it hard to apply. It just feels weird as you are applying it because you are swiping a wide rectangle against your lips, unlike all other lip products on the planet.<br />I gave it a chance and I think it was a great deal and it does work...just feels weird during application. It's not for me personally and I won't reorder.\n",
      "13502->Meh | 2 | 0 | These are much easier than the regular glue and stick method in my opinion but the adhesive doesn’t work that well, especially in the corners of my eyes I noticed.<br /><br />As for easy to remove, it’s not. My makeup wipe, my spit, water and some soap didn’t work too well and I didn’t wanna scrub my eyes raw or peel off the adhesive once it dried to my lids and real eyelashes.\n",
      "13525->Useless | 1 | 0 | These don't work even a little. After following the instructions, these \"correctors\" peeled from my clean, dry toenail after less than five minutes.<br /><br />At least they were cheap.\n",
      "13545->Works great. No wipe. Quick cure. High gloss. | 4 | 0 | Works great. Quick cure. No wipe. High gloss.<br />Bummer was the brush on the base coat was missing. They did refund my purchase. I just used an old brush from another bottle.\n",
      "13553->Some Good and Some Bad | 3 | 0 | This is one of those products what tries to wow you with great packaging and high quality materials.  Seriously, the packaging for this thing is better than a $450 watch I got recently.  It's top notch.<br /><br />RAZOR HANDLE - C<br />This thing is so heavy it borders on ridiculous.  It's solid metal.  If you dropped it on your foot, it would hurt.  It feels good in your hand until you try to use it.  There are no good grip points and the entire thing is smooth.  Once it gets wet, it's a nightmare to hold and use.<br /><br />BLADES - A<br />The blades are some of the best you'll find.  Super close shave and they last a number of shaves.  You really can't beat them.<br /><br />CREAM - F<br />Garbage.  This stuff is better than nothing, but that's about it.  I used it once and then threw it out.<br /><br />BASE - A<br />Yes you get a base to hold your razor.  It's heavy, has a rubber bottom and it stays put.<br /><br />USEABILITY - D-<br />Bad.  If they have the best blades, how is it bad?  The head that holds the blade is so big, that it gets in the way.  Why this is not an issue for most parts of your face, it's a big issue when trying to shave under your nose.  I had to grab a second razor to reach that area.  They went for form over function with this one.<br /><br />If you want a super heavy razor, that will last forever, then skip this one.  You are better off with a blade from Supply.  They do a very similar thing.  Big high end handle and then try to survive off of the blades.  The big difference is, their razor can shave your whole face.\n",
      "13561->Depends on the User | 2 | 0 | I would imagine that there is a person out there for whom this would be a really good buy.  Unfortunately, that is not me.<br /><br />The headband did not give enough support to hold my thick hair in place.<br /><br />In addition, the buttons are not placed in a location to make my mask more comfortable.  It actually made it worse - and caused the headband to shift significantly.  My husband suggested moving the buttons.  But, if I want to go through that much effort, I can just sew buttons on a headband that I already own - that I know will hold my hair properly.  I returned these headbands.<br /><br />For the price, I would recommend that other people give this product a try.  It was just not the right product for me.\n",
      "13567->I like it | 4 | 0 | This shampoo and conditioner combo made my hair very soft. It also smells very good, which is something I'm picky about. I also like the unique twist bottles.<br /><br />As far as breakage, there hasn't been any change from my usual shampoo and conditioner. I am still shedding quite a bit.\n",
      "13573->Overpriced, doesn't smell like argan oil and to me just about average | 3 | 0 | This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.\n",
      "13586->Good Idea but not function well | 1 | 0 | I like to soak my feet and tried to find a easy store product .<br />This item caught my eye, but...<br />I was disappointment by the quality of it...<br />It started leaking after first use and because of the soft materials, this can’t hold enough water to cover the need height.\n",
      "13592->Using In Soap Making: Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger | 5 | 0 | I initially tried this as a body scrub. I find it is too dry & too much got wasted to be effective.<br /><br />I make my own cold process milk soaps & thought I'd give this a try that way. I make up my batch & mix some of this into part of the batter to do a layered swirl mix as to not over power the soap & make it too gritty. The bars look great & smell great, plus there is the natural exfoliation which is wonderful for the hands as well as the body.<br /><br />I personally love this as a kitchen hand soap because it really helps to remove cooking smells from the skin. Plus, the granules make for a wonderful, although brief hand massage.<br /><br />No toxic fragrances or perfumes, just natural safe ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.\n",
      "13596->Great looking lashes, but causes lash fallout. | 3 | 0 | Yes this delivers mascara and you can comb through for full thick lashes which look great.<br />BUT<br />I have to deduct 2 stars because when washing off (gently as usual)<br />as I always get at least 1-2 lashes falling out from this mascara :(<br />NOT cool. I'll keep the comb applicator since I can still use it to groom lashes / brows.\n",
      "13597->No suction | 1 | 0 | Very disappointed in the stiffness of the suction cups. There is no way these would ever stick to a tub side.<br />Useless.<br />The pump it comes with was more trouble than just blowing it up with one’s mouth.<br />Returned\n",
      "13615->Absolutely cannot live without | 5 | 0 | I absolutely love this mascara<br />My eyelashes are fabulous at 48 & they do not fall out nor get hard.  This mascara is a game changer for me and my beauty care.  I will never use another brand.\n",
      "13622->Disappointed | 2 | 0 | I read the positive reviews and was excited to find an over the counter product that had such a high success rate for achieving smoother skin.  The problem is when it arrived, my first suspicion was the CVS sticker on it. The next was the old coupon in the box that expired in 2009 when it's mid 2012!  That made me wonder if the product was expired itself.<br /><br />I couldn't find the expiration date ANYWHERE on the box or on the bottle.<br /><br />I decided to try it anyway, it seemed a little dried up (probably because it was expired) but managed to get a couple small clumps.  The fragrance was nice but a bit too strong and lingered longer than I would have liked.<br /><br />Honestly, I returned this, so I can't give long term results.  But this is a review on my first few uses and the experience of receiving.  I will continue looking for another product.\n",
      "13630->Cute, comfortable, but discolor fast | 2 | 0 | Love this design, but the pale color and matte finish meant it absorbed color from my dyed hair and after a week the nails looked a gross dirty brown.<br /><br />If you don't dye your hair you might not have the same issue. Will probably stick to gloss designs or apply a hard gel topcoat to nails from this brand in future.\n",
      "13634->The wand is amazing to bring out those little lashes | 5 | 0 | I am at least a 5 generation of women in my family that has long eye lashes. No bragging, we just do.  Its hard been to find a mascara that doesn't flake, smear or smudge for these lashes. The best part is the lash wand! This wand really does pick up every lash.<br /><br />So here is the sucky part of the review. The product starts to get thick and tacky after 4 - 6 weeks. I clean the wand with a micro towel and use it with a different mascara. Despite the short life of the product, I am still a fan of the wand.\n",
      "13649->Not happy :( | 1 | 0 | Hadn't even gotten a chance to use these and while taking them out of the package 2 different heads came off... highly disappointed<br />As I have been wanting a nice set of makeup brushes for quite awhile :(\n",
      "13667->the fabric has an odor when dry and its not waterproof like it describe | 2 | 0 | Aibilye 3 PACK Shower Cap for Women, Double Waterproof Bath Caps Reusable, Shower Hat with Elastic Band (STYLE-3)<br />I order this set to be use for a \"daughter mother \" match shower cap, but of course it's too big for my daughter so i did some adjustment. the shower cap is thick. but the first layer is a fabric not like the description it's not waterpoof, the inner layer is plastic. so we left it in the bathroom to dry and the layer was an odor because of the fabric.\n",
      "13691->Not for the traveling man… | 4 | 0 | Two things I don’t like about this. It’s weird square shape which fits in no travel soap container I have and the scent or lack of. What exactly is the scent? I actually really like the product. It lathers nice. It’s convenient being a bar so no worrying about it leaking. It will last a long time I bet. Just fix the weird shape. I guess you could use the cardboard thingy it comes in, but how long will that last? Lastly the scent. Give me something! I don’t want a cologne but I want to smell something other than… what is it again?<br /><br />For me it’s a 4.\n",
      "13707->Disappointed | 2 | 0 | The eyebrow pen does not last for a day.<br />Color is good, application easy— just does not last\n",
      "13708->Not for sensitive skin | 2 | 0 | This mask does not work like the ads show.!  Very easy to apply and starts drying quick.<br />This is not for sensitive skin when in 2 minutes my left cheek started to burn so I washed it off with water and then with my face wash.  I would not get, its not fast results like the ads say, its more like it will work over time.\n",
      "13719->not much of bubble.. | 3 | 0 | this shampoo won't give you enough bubble like any other brand shampoo.<br />it makes use shampoo more..\n",
      "13721->Provides Nice Hydration | 5 | 0 | I like this eye cream. So many eye creams don’t work for me because they cause my eyes to become irritated.<br /><br />This is a light weight cream that absorbs almost instantly when I place it around my eyes.<br /><br />I know some reviewers have mentioned that the cream has a scent, but it’s not obvious to me.<br /><br />I’ve used this eye cream for a week and I have not had any irritation or sensitivity to my skin or eyes.<br /><br />My eyes do look more hydrated so this is a winner for me.\n",
      "13746->Works Great! | 5 | 0 | I bought this about a month ago, because I hated soaking my gel nails in acetone. File the tops of your nails like usual, then paint a coat of this on your nails (made from plants, not chemicals). It takes about 10 minutes, not the 5 they advertise, but it really works great 😊. After 10 minutes, I just use my scraper tool and scrape away my gel polish.  Sometimes it takes a second application to get rid of the polish on the sides, but I am very pleased with this product.<br />The reviewers that say this doesn’t work, probably didn’t follow the directions.\n",
      "13762->Think about the swap! | 1 | 0 | To be clear this is well made and quality for the money.<br />It’s not effectively better than badger hair. Not for me.<br />Well made for the money.\n",
      "13766->Hubby LOVES it!! | 5 | 0 | Purchased this on a whim and for the price you can't beat it if you don't like it.  For us however, that's not the case.  My husband has been growing his beard for just over a year now and during this course we have purchased many and I mean MANY beard products..... oils, balms, wax, soaps, etc, etc., etc.......  THIS particular beard oil is so amazing that he is a repeat customer!  We both love the smell and he loves how it makes his beard feel and look.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!!!\n",
      "13783->Such a good product. Doesn't smoke, not a fire hazard, and does what it says, really WELL! | 3 | 0 | I LOVED my brush & hate to give it anything less than 5 stars, I really really do. It changed my life. Made my hair manageable &nice & I love it so much. Unfortunately, the orange things started popping off very quickly, and now here I am after about 7 months and it's completely dead. 😭😭😭😭<br /><br />I have to buy another one.... But I'm going to, that's how much I love it, really.\n",
      "13790->So Far So Good | 5 | 0 | *Free or Discounted Sample Provided for Review*<br /><br />My wife has recently began using this growth serum on her eyelashes. Typically it takes several weeks to see visible results. I have taken a before picture and will update this review in several weeks with a before/after comparison.<br /><br />Importantly, she has had no negative reaction to the serum in the first few uses. The brush is easy to use to apply the serum precisely to the eyelash follicles without getting it in your eyes.\n",

      "13796->Stylish But Hardly Works At All | 1 | 0 | I bought this shaver approximately 6 months ago. From day 1 the razor performed badly. It is very, very slow to cut on 1 day growth (for me) and virtually doesn't work at all on 2 or 3 day growth. My facial hair is not that hard to cut either. I have replaced the blades a number of times - they are expensive - with no improvement.<br />The trimmer is a joke and also hardly works.<br />I just bought a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve razor as a replacement - it works great - I am on my way to trash can after writing this review to dump the Philips razor - an expensive waste of money.<br />Philips - shame - shame...\n",
      "13806->Where’s the magnet? | 4 | 0 | Nice but I’m not sure why it’s called cat eye? There’s no magnet with it. Maybe I’m missing something about it. I’m still new to gel polish. Also with companies would show what color is in a bottle so you wouldn’t have to open each one to see. I would even pay a little more for that. But the price is really good so it’s all fair.<br /><br />The good part is, they are great colors and looks so nice. Goes on smoothly and looks good without being too thick or thin.\n",
      "13825->😌😒😒👎More like a Lotion, Worked Up No Lathers👎😚😚😒😌 | 2 | 0 | When it comes to facial cleansers, one of my biggest pet peeves is that it doesn't work up any foams, no matter how good the product claims it is. I REALLY wanted to love this EasyDew Starter Soft Cleansing Milk, \"milk\" sounds so very Indulgent, also the fact that it's made in Korea - de facto Skincare Capital of Asia, and also its high price point, I had high expectations. But, my very first experience was a disappointing one, as the \"milky\" cleanser worked up nearly no foams at all. At this point, I don't even care that much about its list of active ingredients, no matter how good they are, I felt that my facial cleansing experiences were compromised by the lack of foaming in working up enough lathers, NONE to be visible. If this were a milky \"lotion\", and not intended to be washed off, then I understand! BUT, for facial cleansers, if it were to remove and wash off my oily skins, it DESPERATELY needs some foaming as cleansing agent to clear my pores.<br /><br />😌😒😚👎NOT Recommended👎😚😒😌\n",
      "13829->So handy to have | 4 | 0 | The small bottles that come with the sleeves are easily removed to be filled. They are simple to fill from a larger bottle that has a pump. For other types of bottles, you can use a funnel. The bottles don’t leak as long as they are securely closed after use. The inner bottle is protected from breakage by the sleeve. I like that there are options for the colors of sleeves.<br /><br />Each bottle has a small carabiner clip that can be used to attach it to a bag or belt loop.\n",
      "13832->Fine nose strips (pretty comparable to all the other brands) | 3 | 0 | These blackhead removing nose strips are fine. Nothing special in comparison to other blackhead removing strips--it works similarly. The strip dries on the nose and you peel it off. It isn't overly hard or painful. It peels off easily and leaves behind a little black residue that washes off easily. I felt it removed a decent amount of blackheads.<br /><br />It's clearly not made in America as the English in the instructions is classic \"Google translate\" language--you know funny word choice, questionable grammar, etc. If that is something that matters to you, make note.\n",
      "13867->Not at all as pictured :( | 1 | 0 | Not at ALL as pictured.  What happened?  These are thin and sparse, very disappointing.  Might as well just wear my own natural lashes, lol.<br />If we weren't so busy this weekend getting ready for family flying in for the Fourth of July, I'd be sending them back today.  These are the only lashes I've been disappointed with from Amazon, usually lashes look the same as the picture.<br />If those were out of stock and they substituted these, I would rather have waited for the ones IN THE PICTURE.\n",
      "13894->Now I do not need a funnel to fill my travel size mouthwash container | 5 | 0 | Need to pump 3/4x’s, that’s ok though.<br /> Pump can squirt a little on the coming back up.\n",
      "13896->Beautiful but pricey | 3 | 0 | This is a very nice, well made scrunchie, but what I do not understand is, why one scrunchie is $17? I have gotten a 52 pack for $8 before and they are all very nice scrunchies. Yes I understand that the silk does not damage the hair and therefore doesn't cause split ends, but at this price it better blow dry my hair for me while I am still sleeping.<br /><br />It is beautiful, the color is a very nice deep emerald green, it is very well made, the silk has no pulled threads or anything, but I don't think I would be willing to spend that kind of money on just one. If this was a 5 pack or so I would be ok with it even for silk.\n",

      "13948->Super cute 2 in 1 nail file/shiner | 4 | 0 | Super cute 2 in 1 nail file/shiner.  This cute glass file comes with a carrying/protective case. The file is easy to hold and super easy to use. I like the idea of using a glass file instead of the regular cardboard style ones as you cannot clean the cardboard ones. Also the cardboard ones do not last very long  as they are cardboard and most do not come with a case so you cannot take it with you (unless you want everything in your purse to get scratched). I really like this glass one and think it will last a while, I don't believe that it will last 10 years but I do believe that it will last much longer than the cardboard ones and is more sanitary. My only complaint about this is that the box it came in was all in another language and there was no english on it at all. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, all words and opinions are my own. My review and rating is based off my experiance with said product and I received no payment for this review.<br />Amazons star rating:<br />1 star-I hate it (my rating-do not buy)<br />2 stars-I don't like it (my rating-do not buy/not for me/broken pieces)<br />3 stars-It's okay (my rating-needs improvements/not for me)<br />4 stars' I like it (my rating-like it/would buy again/recommend/would gift)<br />5 stars I love it (my rating-love love love/will be buying more/again/nothing wrong with for me)\n",

I tried this Razor at my sisters house, and loved it as well. So, I went out and bought it at Sam's club. The first day was wonderful, and then the second was OK, and then by the third day I couldn't use it! So, i have to replace the heads every three days? I don't think so! On that third day I had to use a lather soap, which I shouldn't have to use since the head has gel built into it! I really don't think it is worth the money.\n",

Works with my case, so gets two stars.<br /><br />Revised 9/26: The first cover wouldn't stay stuck at the top end of the phone and kept catching on stuff, so I removed it and installed the second cover this morning.  Just now I noticed that it is already cracked from the edge and curves around to the top.  On the plus side, it seems to be sticking to the phone better than the first, but it's cracked, so....  Down to 1 star.\n",
      "14011->hard to squeeze out just a small amount | 3 | 0 | Macray Travel bottle with clip 2oz 6pk - X002N638MR<br /><br />I wanted to use these to hold hand sanitizer. I clip it to the shoulder strap (on my chest) of my backpack so my hand sanitizer is always within reach. However, this type of container isn't well suited for squeezing out gels in small amounts. The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.  I found these bottles are better used for shampoo, conditioner, body wash where you need much larger volumes squeezed out than you would need for hand sanitizer.\n",
      "14022->Nice ( for $ ) But A bit Unnatural | 4 | 0 | It's the best wig (in this price range) I've found so far. After about a month of searching, I've finally found one that is<br />- soft<br />- doesn't tangle<br />- and has a natural color.<br />Unfortunately, it's strong shine and the way the ends curl make it appear incredibly fake in most lights.<br />With that being said, it is possible to style the wig with a flat iron, though I wouldn't go over about 250 degrees--otherwise, it begins to fuzz up.<br />So that takes care of the unnatural curling.<br />For the shine, I tried applying baby power throughout and that helped some, but it still does looks a little too silky smooth (See photos with flash).<br />Note: I did have to cut the bangs; they were about 2 inches too long (better than too short though!).\n",
      "14058->Can't create individual lines | 2 | 0 | On my face I have some eyebrows, not a lot. I was hoping this pencil would create the illusion of individual hairs, three at a time, because the item has three points on it. Nope, maybe I have too heavy of a hand, but it just smudges a heavy smudge. If I go lighter, it doesn't do anything.<br />I bought two and one dried out pretty quickly. Maybe I didn't put the cap on tightly enough.\n",

      "14113->strong performance | 3 | 0 | I bought this as a blind buy, as there were no reviews on this fragrance.<br />I used to really like the original Candies, from back in the day. I was so upset when it was discontinued.<br />That said, my nostalgia got the best of me when I saw this on Amazon. I don’t recall what the original Candies smelled like, so its hard to say how close this is to the OG formulation, but this one smells really sweet. My initial response to it was “aqua net hairspray with citrus magic”. It is very ‘orangey’, and the citrus is huge here.<br />Once the hairspray smell goes away, it smells rather nice. It doesn’t smell expensive, you can tell it’s not a high end fragrance, but it’s nice. I wouldn’t buy another bottle, though. Same thing with the Candies Black (which I also bought- blindly). I wouldn’t renew either of these, but it was not a waste. They smell “OK” enough to wear out, and the projection is intense. These “new” Candies frags will make people around you get a headache, if you take a bath in them. A few sprays is literally all you need. Both are extremely strong, and the scent lasts a while on the skin, and a very long time on clothing.<br />It has a little bit of a gourmand thing going on after it dries...it smells like lemans and oranges. I suppose wanting to eat it is why it’s called “Candies”, so in that regard, kudos.<br />There’s something going on beneath all the citrus, but I cannot for the life of me put my finger on it.<br />Just know this is very sweet, like Invuctus, but “cheaper” smelling. It’s really not terrible, but they’re not for me.<br />A teenager may love these Candies fragrances, but if you are over 30, you may want to think again.\n",
      "14120->First time user- positive experience | 4 | 0 | So up until now, I have only heard of acne patches.<br /><br />My friend who also has severe acne problem recommended Mighty Patch to me & I didn’t think twice.<br />The step by step instructions plus a short video on the usage, helps immensely.<br /><br />The box includes 10 Vegan-friendly patches for the chin, it has a great coverage. It worked like magic on my skin.\n",
      "14122->Fake-looking color and too shiney. | 3 | 0 | As with most man-made fiber, this \"hair\" has a fake-looking shine. So, it would never pass for real hair.<br /><br />Also, the color mix looks fake.\n",
      "14134->Thin Material but Cute | 3 | 0 | I gave it 3 stars because I got these for my daughters who are 5 and 6 yrs old. They are adorable and fit them well.<br />The problem is the material is way too thin and started to rip within two weeks of them using them.<br />I bought 2 so I have 4 in total.\n",
      "14143->Decent product! | 4 | 0 | So I don’t own a blow dryer or a hair straightener. I know. I bought this to hopefully replace the need for both of them. Pictured: my hair styled when damp, my hair styled and natural side-by-side, and my hair styled when dry (tie-dye shirt).<br /><br />Some pros: I have very wavy, long, fine hair, but a ton of it, and can dry/style my hair in under 30 minutes with this. Yes the brush size is huge, but with how much hair I have, I need it to be large. The style it produced was beautiful! I will be keeping this for sure!<br /><br />Some cons: I deducted a star mainly because this brush doesn’t get very hot. I guess this could be a pro since it won’t damage your hair as much over time. But for me, I noticed that some parts of my hair were still wavy, and that the style didn’t hold perfectly over time.<br /><br />Some tips: definitely use this tool on damp hair. It semi-straightened my dry hair, but the style did not hold over time and my hair went right back to wavy in an hour. I had to go over my damp hair a few times, but make sure to maintain tension when you pull. That’s the best way I was able to get my hair straight. Another reason I deducted a star was because I still feel like I need a flat iron to do touch ups—around my roots specifically. But this product is definitely better than using a flat iron all over!<br /><br />Verdict: worth $20! Glad I purchased.\n",
      "14145->Excellent facial moisturizer and eye cream | 5 | 0 | I have been using this moisturizer in combination with InstaNatural's Vitamin C Toner and their Vitamin C Serum with 20% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and really enjoy using all 3 products.<br /><br />InstaNatural uses all or almost all natural ingredients and you can tell the difference.  Their products either have no scent or rely on the natural ingredients for fragrance.  This moisturizer contains cocoa butter and smells lightly of cocoa.<br /><br />The consistency is a bit thicker than other facial moisturizers I have used but absorbs really well and absolutely does not leave a greasy or oily residue.<br /><br />It is supposed to help with texture and tone of skin. I don't feel like it has clogged my pores and leaves my skin feeling well hydrated.  It is thick and effective enough to be used as an under eye cream and this is the area where I have noticed the best result without having to use a separate product which I appreciate.\n",
      "14155->Very Disappointing | 1 | 0 | Nail clipper very big, hard to get small curticles cut, tasks big slivers.<br />Curticle pusher is sharp and cuts the nail.<br />Overall very disappointing!!!\n",
      "14157->Wig | 4 | 0 | Its great but you have to style it. Joe exotics mullet is not as long as this one and the bangs are very long as well. I had to style it with clippers.<br /><br />Well made wig and the accessories are pretty good. Top of the wig is very thick (VERY thick) so a hat is hard to put over.\n",
      "14166->Nice oil, no organic certificate | 2 | 0 | This is great castor oil - very hydrating!<br />Only problem is this is listed as organic and there's no organic certificate or certifier listed anywhere.  This is clearly NOT organic.  Misleading information on your listing and packaging is not ok with me, not recommended.\n",
      "14185->Pretty good | 4 | 0 | I like these lashes a lot and they look pretty good. When wearing them, you can feel something on your eyelid, so if you need a natural feel these may not be for you. My problem is that the magnetic eyeliner is a real pain to get off. I have tried micellar water and eye-makup remover, the latter works better, but I still have to scrub my eyes hard to get it off.<br />All the same I do like these lashes and still wear them from time to time.\n",
      "14191->Very thick gel | 4 | 0 | This kit includes everything needed with the exception of a UV light. The instructions are included and and come with illustrations but there is room for improvement in the clarification of the process, particularly for anyone new to  using this type of nail kit.<br /><br />The only issue I have is the gel tubes. The gel is quite thick even at room temperature. This makes it a bit difficult to work with.\n",
      "14199->Works good | 4 | 0 | Pros: definitely keeps nozzle on, gets a bit hot<br />Cons: you have to be sure vent holes are not covered by pushing it on too snug<br />Its heavy...adds weight ti hairdrier...my sr mom couldn't use it for that reason.  I make it work but its heavier.  That makes styling harder\n",
      "14226->Kojic Acid May Help Lighten The Skin | 5 | 0 | I became interested in kojic acid because it has the ability to remove iron from the skin. Excess iron in the body is a cause of heart disease and cancer (in men, who often have excess iron, giving blood regularly reduces the risk of these two diseases). Some people (myself included) suspect that excess iron can also age the skin more quickly.<br /><br />Kojic acid is also known to lighten the skin to a degree, so can be useful to treat scars and excessive pigmentation. This is the main reason people use it.<br /><br />That being said, it won't work miracles with your skin in this area. It may have a minor effect, and did so on my skin. However, I believe it is a part of an overall healthy skin routine.<br /><br />This kojic acid cream seems good. Kojic acid is listed as one of the first ingredients and many of the other ingredients are good for the skin too. So if you are looking for a kojic acid cream, give this a try.\n",
      "14243->Ordered 2 both defective. | 1 | 0 | Ordered and the headband came without a leaf in the middle. So you have a big space of the brass head and center of your skull.<br />Ordered a second one thinking surely I received a defective one. Nope second one showed up the same way.<br />The leaves on the head and are made nice, unfortunately they're all soldered and you can't remove one to get at least one nice headband.<br />The leaves on the hair clips are completely different and look like fern leaves, they're not attractive. There's no teeth in the clip to grab hair and the ends are extremely tight so they grab small bunches of hair and rip them out.<br />Returned both.\n",
      "14249->Cheap-didn’t make it five months | 2 | 0 | Update: It has not even been five months since I have these to my five year old, and all but one are broken. The headbands have either snapped or the ribbon has unraveled. These were not stepped on or used inappropriately either. Just wearing them breaks them down. They are cute, but if you want something that is going to last and not upset your child, stay away from these.<br /><br />These are well made and look great! My five year old loves them!\n",
      "14252->No file | 2 | 0 | I LOVE this product. But don't buy this listing for the nail file, you won't get it.<br />That being said the shampoo and conditioner is the bomb! Longer lasting color, brings out natural reds in your hair. Keeps your hair soft and prevents tangles. Helps minimize frizz.\n",
      "14253->Didn’t do it for me | 2 | 0 | I like that this mask doesn’t feel too heavy and you can distribute it pretty easily on your hair.<br />That being said, I do feel it can be a bit thicker, and more moisturizing. Instead, after I  wash this off and dry my hair, there’s a feeling of product residue that’s supposed to feel soft. The smell is also not the greatest, but I know when it comes to fragrances it is all relative.<br />My hair is bleached and I was really hoping I could find a product to hydrate my strands, but this wasn’t it.\n",
      "14269->Works Better for Much Older & Wrinkled Skins | 2 | 0 | We all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Crystal Lemon Face Lift Tape』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a ‘band-aid solution to a mature face’. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial ‘tape’ that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference 🙄😏🤔😁😄<br /><br />🙏🙏 If you find my review helpful, pls hit the 👍🙏🙏\n",
      "14281->When you use them, follow directions | 4 | 0 | This mask is a little bit different from others, Many are like paper. This one is a bit heavier and you will want to probably lay down while you have this on so that it doesn't slip. Follow the Directions: STEP 1. Remove the film<br />Clear up the skin with toner after cleansing, take the mask pack and remove the white film on one side. STEP 2. Attach the mask pack.  Attach the upper half with your eyes at the center and the lower half with your mouth at the center. Tip! It is better to attach the lower part first. STEP 3. Absorption. Remove the mask after 30 minutes and absorb the essence remaining on the skin by lightly tapping it with your fingers. The final on this mask is that it feels good, it does a good job and I am glad there are 3 more I can use before I have to buy more\n",
      "14284->Softest hands ever, lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil, lemon oil, orange oil, rosemary | 5 | 0 | I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.<br /><br />One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer, then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.<br /><br />Love their designs on the bottles.<br /><br />Water, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Guar Gum, Lemongrass Oil, Orange Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lemon Oil, Rosemary Extract, Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap, but none remains in the final product)\n",

      "14298->Good product | 4 | 0 | This is comparable to my original finishing touch that I've had for over a decade and just started dying on me. It's not as great, but pretty good. It doesn't get as close of a trim as the FT, but it trims well enough (I only use it for cleaning up eyebrows and stray facial hairs). Feels a little rough on the skin when using a specific side. Machine feels just as sturdy as the FT. The blade casing is a little wobbly, but it doesn't impede function.<br /><br />The box states battery included, but it did not come with one.\n",

Yalmeh products in the past and have been very happy with the results that I got | 5 | 0 | I have tried other Yalmeh products in the past and have been very happy with the results that I got. Needless to say, I had high hopes when I started using this eye gel. I was and still am very impressed with how well it works for my sensitive undereye area, as it really reduces the puffiness under my eyes that I am perpetually plagued with, when I wake up in the morning. It is also working so well as far as hydrating my eye area goes! This product and brand always delivers the results that I am hoping to get from skin care products.

I hope that this review helps someone to decide whether or not to purchase an item for their own personal use. I only give 4 and 5 star reviews to items that I would purchase again or recommend to my friends and family.<br /><br />Everybody has different results for every product so with that being said the only way to really know if you like this product is to try to yourself.

      "14368->Narrow headbands that are not sturdy enough to keep the masks tight to the face | 2 | 0 | There are six (6) velvet headbands with buttons in this set. Each headband is narrow at only 8-3/4\" wide and certainly not as wide as pictured on the Amazon site. Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment. The current price of $11.99 comes to $2 per band but I do not feel they are worth that price at all.\n",
      "14370->Works Gr8 - No Joke | 4 | 0 | I read the instructions carefully before using this product, after reading a review in which someone attempted a comedy routine - rather than present a review of the product.<br />I noticed that the box has braille on it, which touched my heart for others.<br />The pump-bottle works great, but I DO use 2 hands to dispense it.<br />The product makes my dry eyes feel lubricated and soothed:  I have dry eye + I am using therapeutic PPIs this month & I work on a computer most of the day.<br />This product works well, for those of us who are suffering daily with eye discomfort.<br />And that's no joke.\n",
      "14390->a dangerous product for people ignorant about skincare | 1 | 0 | Let me start out by saying that I do not have sensitive skin. When I applied the bubble mask, it burned, and in fact my skin kept burning for hours afterward. Whenever you feel something fizzing on your skin, it doesn't mean that &#34;it's working&#34;, what it really means is that irritation is taking place.<br />The mask is also extremely soapy and hard to wash off, it reminded me of washing laundry detergent off your hands. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that was precisely how they made it foam - by adding laundry detergent.<br />I suggest you read up on skincare (reputable, scientifically supported sites like beautypedia.com) and stay away from products like these.\n",

The stuff is what it is, and retinol is good stuff, if you want to turn over your skin cells the way they used to do it for yourself.<br /><br />This cream has an excellent formula of retinol, moisturizers, and antioxidants. What it also has that many others don't is a pump that keeps air and light from destroying the ingredients. It's 3% retinol, which is pretty strong, so patch test.<br /><br />Recommend.\n",

      "14432->It did not work | 2 | 0 | I bought the product thinking it would be easier to wash my toddler's hair, but it was nearly impossible to put this on my toddler's head. Maybe for a younger child who is able to be still and does not  move, then this product might work.  If your child has long hair, it would even be more difficult to put on. The other issue is that even if you put it on, then you have to still take off the hat and rinse off the section where the hat is, if you want to rinse off all the sample. The product is mailed directly from China, so it took a while to be delivered.<br />It seemed a good idea, but it just did not work at all.\n",

If your face is the size of an 8 year old's, they'll work fine;  otherwise, forget it!<br />And because the sheets are the texture of cardboard, you cannot STRETCH them out over your face, as you should be able to do.

      "14439->To date the fastest, most convenient, least messy shave I've had | 4 | 0 | This shaver really is a treat to use. I have had no difficulty with the \"grade\" of shave slipping mid shave and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.<br />The shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I'm using.<br />So far I've had four shaves off the one charge and I shave once a week, so the battery seems to hold its charge really well.<br />Cleaning is a cinch.<br />It's noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer. It's certainly not anything that's a detraction from the shave.<br />The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because of the area just under the nose, the other reviewers that have mentioned this are correct - it's very hard to get to this area without contorting your nose and/or lip.<br />I simply remove the protector and do the last few hairs freehand with the open shaver or a pair of cuticle scissors.<br />The overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.<br />Very nice carrying bag too included.\n",

      "14451->Complicated and NOT WATERPROOF | 2 | 0 | I soo wanted to love this product but it turned out to be a disappointment. Maybe because it's not one of those ridiculously priced, \"high-end\" magnetic eyelashes..?!<br />First of all, it took me several tries to apply the magnetic eyeliner exactly where it needed to be so the lashes don't end up too high or too low on the eye lid. Then I had to snip one end of each lash to fit my eyelids. Not that that part was a problem, but that when I would put the lash on, the now-snipped area was poking my eyelids. So I tried snipping the lash by rounding the pokey areas as closest to the nearest magnet as possible. That helped a little. Once the lashes was finally on, my eyelids felt a little weighed down but I thought, \"I just gotta get used to it!\" and I felt like \"that's the best it'll get\". So, I went about my day with the lashes on. About 2 hours later, the lashes started to fall off because my eyes started to water. I tend to get watery eyed every so often. One of the main reasons I purchased these lashes was because it claimed to be waterproof. I tried wearing the lashes again, on three more occasions, just to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong with applications, but when my eyes would water, the lashes would start to fall off again.<br />Soo, nope! After all that, this product can be complicated and it's NOT WATERPROOF, as it claims to be.\n",

The information on this page clearly indicates that they are compatible with ALL (emphasis theirs) Oral-B electrich toothbrushes, with the exception of Sonic models (which I do not have, I have the Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000).<br /><br />As such, I cannot really recommend them. They will brush your teeth, but only if you're comfortable catching it in your hand every 30 seconds or so.\n",
      "14622->Why didn't they include a brush saver and extra brushes?! | 2 | 0 | If you don't already have extra brushes and the brush saver, this set is useless after one or 2 nails.<br />Something about these liquids wreaks havoc on brushes and usually after one or 2 nails your brushes are toast. That's why they make the saver and usually include extra brushes.<br />The scent is very obnoxious and should be used in well ventilated area.  I can not recommend this product at all.\n",

I think it’s important to wear comfortable lashes because they will be sitting on your face all day.<br />These have a very flattering shape, and they wear so well with my little sized eyes.

      "14676->Cheap | 1 | 0 | I was excited to get this product so my lotions would be smaller and easy to use.  I loaded it up and when I put the stopper back in, it fell thru into the lotion itself.  No matter how careful I was, it just could not hold up to the pressure you have to use to push out the lotion.  DO NOT BUY.  It just won't work.  Also,  you have to use the case it comes with because the lotions WILL come out of the tiny  hole.<br />UPDATE:  I took this on vacation AND used the case.  This was the only item I did not have in a protective bag (because it had a case).  When I opened the bag it was in, sure enough it had leaked out of the container.  DO NOT PURCHASE\n",
      "14680->Transfer resistant formula 😷 with excellent coverage! Unlike any BB cream I've ever tried! | 4 | 0 | The Fromnature BB cream by Cosmocos is unlike any beauty balm I've ever tried. It has much better coverage, and a thicker consistency than any other BB's I've used (which, until now, have all been Western brands). It almost covers like a foundation, but feels extremely lightweight like a BB. It does dry down really fast, and it was a bit darker than I expected. I am light neutral in complexion and chose the shade \"light beige\". I believe I was able to make the color work for me, but I'm not sure if it'll suit all light skin tones. 👻<br /><br />This BB has a beautiful satin matte finish, but did have a tendency to cling to my dry patches, so be sure to start with an exfoliated, well moisturized, and primed face. I did not use any primer with this product, (since it's marketed as a BB cream), and without the aid of a pore filling primer this product did eventually settle into my fine lines & large pores. I am really impressed with the staying power of this product though, even without primer & setting spray! After a full day of masking against covid in the South Florida heat, there was no transfer to my face mask. 😃 That's a huge, HUGE plus! With that being said, I highly recommend using a really good cleanser to efficiently remove this product at the end of the day.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Great coverage that can be built up<br />+ Very lightweight on the skin<br />+ Excellent staying power<br />+ SPF 50<br />+ Transfer resistant! 🙌<br />+ No photo flashback!<br />+ Fragrance free!<br />+ 1.67 oz of product (vs. the U.S. standard 1 fl. oz)<br />+ 2 sample hair care products included as a bonus! ❤<br />+ Convenient PRIME Shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Dries very fast and can be difficult to blend<br />- Clings to dry patches<br />- Settles into pores & wrinkles (without primer)<br /><br />TO BE CONSIDERED:<br />* Warm yellow undertone may not suit everyone<br /><br />Side Note: There was one other thing I wanted to mention... When I took the manufacturer safety seal off of the tube, I had a volcanic eruption of BB cream that I wasn't prepared for, which made a mess of my tube. If you're like me and don't want to waste precious product, just be aware that it might come spilling out like lava when you break the product seal. 🙃\n",

      "14717->Try a different brand. | 2 | 0 | I don't like these but I am not going to give up on magnetic lashes!<br />I purchased these before they had this many low ratings.<br /><br />I think these suffer from having the magnets on the outside of the lash pieces. They are really hard to position even after patiently giving it my best for a while. They also slip and slide around my lashes. Also, the packaging! They stick them to the case with tacky tape stuff that made them a bit difficult to remove.\n",
      "14718->Love it | 5 | 0 | I was skeptical after reading the reviews and taking note of the cheap price, but I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did.  I never, ever use any type of lotion on my face because my skin is already like an oil slick. However, after using this product for just over a week, I ordered two more bottles.<br /><br />This lotion seems to be controlling the oil on my face. There's a lot less of it now.  I have acne scars and red blotches from 40 years of bad skin, but now my skin tone has evened out. I was also recently diagnosed with sebaceous hyperplasia and my dermatologist said there is nothing to be done except have the spots removed if they bother me. The smaller spots have now vanished and the big one has stopped growing.  This is why I ordered two additional bottles.<br /><br />Also, other reviews complain about the eye dropper.  I've had no trouble using it. The lotion is thin enough that it is easily sucked into the dropper. The only issue is that the outside of the dropper has lotion on it so it sometimes gets on the neck of the bottle when I put it back.  I'd definitely recommend this product.\n",

Thick, large and easily removes all ten nails worth of polish without making my fingers feel overly dried out like using my regular polish remover.<br />Because they are all individually sealed I can keep one in my bag for any polish removing emergencies, which trust me... they happen.<br />These work fast, I don't know what makes the formula 'advanced' but the process is quick and clean.<br />The smell isn't overwhelming, just the basic remover smell.

Even to Dove white soap bar and Cetaphil bars.  They cause eczema.  I use some natural glycerin soaps and olive oil soaps to bath, but they are too drying for hand washing.  These work.  Even though I do react to them a little it’s not bad at all.  I don’t break out or get fissures on my hands, so all good.  It’s just a little drying if I was my hands too much.<br /><br />This product is a live saver.\n",

I'll stay with the similarly priced L'Oreal cushion that leaves me with a natural finish, no aching cyctic responses from poor pores, or otherwise feeling awful about my skin.<br /><br />The shade #2 was okay for my neutral undertone/Nude Beige in drugstore brands skin, so that's worth...

It's taken a while and while it is growing back, it tends to fall in their faces. This set of bows is a nice way to clip that back. You can use them like little clips but they also have bows on them, so they look really cute on them.<br /><br />The bows seem to be good quality, we have used them several times a week for two girls since we got them and none have come undone or had any problems. They are really a good way to make them look put together, even when they decide to pick out their own outfits. These work really well for the front, side and we have even clipped them over pig tails/pony tails a few times and they just look sweet.<br /><br />I am very happy with the quality<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT  (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

      "14813->weightless, non tacky, fully absorbs quickly, NO added fragrance, no scent | 3 | 0 | I have Rosacea, specifically type 1 where I experience redness from flushing and visible veins (telangiectasias). Otherwise clear skin. While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier. Got super sensitive skin? work on repairing that skin barrier before anything else.<br />--NO added fragrance in ingredient list. No naturally occurring scent either. I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry. I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product. I am a little early on writing this, but my skin is used to centella asiatica as well as EGFs, and with some Isntree products.\n",

      "14883->Dissapointing! | 1 | 0 | The comes received are very brittle and<br />Next to impossible to get a tight fit.  I have had a tooth break off of two pair just trying to get them to interlock in my hair. They are better than none but nothing like my original pair from years ago.  Those are made of a much more flexible plastic that interlock easily and as tight as you need them.  My hair is very thin and using them for the first time I could not get them to fit tightly.  They kept letting my hair fall out and loosing through out the day, very irritating.<br /><br />Well a few uses later and this is the result in the attached picture. The breakage occurred attempting to seperate either while in my hair or prior to putting them in my hair.<br /><br />Look for the France Lux combs, they have tapered teeth thus slide apart and together easily.  They are more flexible vs the brittle plastic of the combs in the above picture.\n",
      "14889->Poorly Designed Heads Fill Up Fast | 3 | 0 | The biggest problem with this design is that if you have a heavy/fast growing beard is that you may have to stop and clean it mid-shave. There just isn't any room for cut whiskers in the tiny heads and where a heavy 1-day growth is a maybe a 2-day growth is way more than it can hold. I think that may be why some people complain about the closeness and/or speed of the shave. It works really great until it loads up with fur and there is no room left for more. This is really a razor for those that have a light growth or shave twice a day cleaning it thoroughly each time.<br /><br />Note to Norelco: Increase the cut whisker capacity in next year's model.\n",

As there was no other color that would be better, I can't buy this product; however, if you can find a good color for you the quality and ease of application is wonderful.<br />I also recommend that they stamp the name of the company on the actual pencil so that if I ever wanted to buy it again I would know how to do that. Right now, the pencil that has no writing, only the color number 04 at the bottom.\n",

After reading more about this brush, she liked the features it mentioned and<br />decided to try it. It arrived well packaged, and undamaged. It came with instructions and a usb<br />cord. After trying it for a while, my wife said she really likes the shape and the way it feels in her<br />hand. It is easy to maneuver around the contours of her face and she feels her face is getting<br />cleaner after using it. Although she likes the red light feature, it is not something she uses<br />regularly. She does like that it is small enough to carry in her purse. However, one of the main<br />reasons she wanted this is because of the waterproof capability. But with the usb port open, she<br />really does not feel comfortable using it in the shower. That was a disappointment. Also, it<br />does not come with a carrying case or bag, which would have been nice. I am giving it four<br />stars because the features we are left with are good ones and my wife feels that her skin has<br />improved since using this brush.\n",

I did two nail swatches, and before I was finished with the second one the base coat brush had dried almost completely out. It's unusable until cleaned. The top coat brush was also drying out.<br />Luckily a different brand sends several brushes along with their sets, and they actually fit these bottles. It would have been nice if this company had sent along extra brushes. A brush cleaner would have been nice, also. If I didn't have extra brushes, I would just be out of luck.<br />I've used so many dip liquids and have done so many dip nail sets, and this is the first time I've ever had a brush dry out.

We're a family of suncreen users, mostly due to the fact that we're easily fried with extended outdoor exposure. With the grandson doing all sorts of outside activities, we need this.<br /><br />The effectiveness from being sunburned appears to be the same as with the SPF 50, at least to our untrained senses. I do understand it's more about how long the effectiveness lasts versus stronger coverage. Between the two (50 six pack versus 30 single), for our family the six pack makes it much more affordable. If you're going to use a lot, choose that. If you're just an occassional user, buy the single.\n",

The salt scrub removes dirt, dead skin, and harmful substances from the skin. It claims to help to reduce acne, blackheads, cellulite and scarring. I don’t have these issues on my body so I can’t say if it does work for that.<br /><br />I do have sensitive skin and didn’t have any reaction to using this scrub! The scrub is really dark but surprisingly light on the skin. It spreads easily and rinses off just as easy.

My skin did feel a bit dry after I used this though and I would have wished it would be more hydrating as they promised. I had to follow it up with a nice moisturizer to make sure my skin didn't dry out too much when I use this cleanser. In my eyes this cleanser is just ok. I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall. This cleanser did not hydrate but it did cleanse well and was gentle, so at least it performed along those lines. So for that I gave it a 3 star rating.\n",

      "15062->Electric Toothbrush, Electric Flosser Are Real Deal | 5 | 0 | This PHILIPS SONICARE ESSENCE+ TOOTHBRUSH & AIRFLOSS ELECTRIC FLOSSER (Value Bundle) is the real deal.  The sonic toothbrush gets your teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush, because of the vibrating brush head and the 2-minute timer that tells you when you’ve brushed long enough.  A nice feature is that the color on the brush head bristles fades to let you know that the brush head is worn out and needs replacing.<br /><br />The electric flosser works really well--maybe not quite as well as string floss, but it’s definitely better than poking into gaps between teeth with a toothpick on a handle.  The flosser is good for cleaning under my bridge, which needs to be kept really clean to prevent gum irritation and swelling.\n",

      "15159->Great Until the Setting Slips! | 2 | 0 | I scoured the net looking for the perfect beard trimmer to trim my beard that I brough back from Iraq.  I didn't want to look like a terrorist, so I needed a trimmer to keep my beard looking civilized.  I read the reviews here and was prepared for a somewhat weak vacuum- even on turbo.  No big deal- I wanted results, and the vacuum was just a perk anyway.  It caught maybe half the hair on turbo, so whoopie.<br /><br />Well, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews!  I was careful not to hold the trimmer by the click wheel to avoid accidentally going down a setting... I did that once and clicked from a 5 to a 4.  I liked the 4 better anyway, so stuck with that.  I happily trimmed to a 4 once a week (sometimes twice to clean it up) for the last couple months and it worked well, until just a couple of days ago when the setting slipped all the way down to 1 when I was in the middle of shaving!  I went from a nice beard to the 5 o-clock shadow look!  I AM FURIOUS!<br /><br />There needs to be some sort of setting lock that prevents it from just slipping and ruining your beard!  How hard would that be?  Just build the dial with a notch you can slide a bar into in order to lock it!<br /><br />Until they build this with a locking device, avoid it, or you could lose your hard-earned beard- just like I did!\n",

And I have to admit that the packaging influenced my purchase:)<br /> I really like the feel of the serum and the light fragrance.  I, unlike other reviewers, couldn't fit it over my ears. Also the eye holes were way too small.  Tip: use the peeI off backing and laid it on my neck and chest.<br />Left it on for 10 minutes and when I removed it I have small bumps all over my face, but now after 30 minutes, they seem to be going away.  Once the serum dries it does feel a little tight on your face but it does not dry out the skin. I finished with a rich moisturizer to &#34;seal the deal.&#34; The next morning my face felt very soft but still had a few bumps around the mouth area.  My advice would be for those who have dry, sensitive skin, might want to be weary of this mask.  Not the mask's fault, mind you, just not a good match for my skin.  I would have given it 5 stars but took one off because of the bumps...\n",
      "15170->Suction cup does t work | 1 | 0 | The .mirror reflection is bad and appears to be covered in a sheer plastic that I am afraid to take off because #1 I might scratch the surface #2 I'm not totally sure that it isn't just a reflective type of a sticker vs glass.<br />And the suction cup lever doesn't work. Junk.\n",
      "15177->Works well to control odor | 5 | 0 | I ordered 'Native Deodorant - Natural Deodorant - 3 Pack Seasonal' for review.  this set comes with three different scents  Each scent is light and not overpowering.  The deodorant is soft and goes on smoothly.  My wife, who has to use an extra strength deodorant has been pleased with the odor control.  Her sensitive skin has no issues with this deodorant.  Overall a great natural product.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!\n",
      "15204->Fragrance on the Go | 5 | 0 | I love the concept of an individual towelette, not only for convenience, but because I can go from fragrance free to smelling delicious in a heartbeat. Lunch with someone sensitive to perfume and dinner with someone who isn't.<br />That being said, I believe that this delivery system lends itself better to lighter fragrances.<br />On unwrapping the packet, you smell a dark, bitter chocolatey, red wine kind of note. Definitely unique. Usually gourmand fragrances are geared for youth, but this is all grown up and adult.<br />Too intense for warm weather, ok for fall and winter.\n",
      "15210->It's pretty good, I guess | 3 | 0 | I'm not well versed in extensions and the like, but thought this was a great idea to change things up every once in a while. The hair itself is beautiful. No shedding issues, no unusual tangling and no weird smells. I was able to straighten if I wanted to and once washed, it went back to it's beautiful natural texture.<br />My only issue with this is the net is huge and I had issues with how to apply it without it bulking up. As I said, I'm not the best with these things but it seems that this piece could be a bit smaller. My 2nd issue is that the strip of hair to wrap around to secure is very thin. I've seen others that are thicker w/ more hair, which makes it easy to hide where the fake hair is secured to your actual ponytail. My 3rd issue is the velcro kept getting caught on my real hair. You have to be super careful but since it was a bit difficult to secure because of the huge net, sometimes I was going so slow that the hair would shift and I had to start again. Kind of hard to explain but I think if I could apply this without worrying about pulling my hair out, it would be easier to secure. Anyway, once I got it on it looked great and I'm sure I'll use it here or there. Just some things for potential buyers to be aware of.\n",
      "15217->THEIR ESTABLISHMENT DESERVES TO BE RAIDED AND THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR RACKETEERING | 1 | 0 | Bought Yaki Straight Wave Human Hair Extensions Weft Weave Natural Black Color 100% Unprocessed.<br /><br />This company is selling synthetic hair and they're lying to us to have us spend our hard-earned money on something that is not truly what they're advertising. And they're taking advantage of a large demographic of people who may not be fully educated of their rights. This is criminal at the very least. And they deserve to be arrested and criminal charges bright up against them and prosecuted for unjust business dealings.<br /><br />Flat ironed the hair @ 350 degrees and it burned CLEAN OFF. I don't have a choice I have to install it now that it is here. This right here is no different than the 10 dollar pack hair that looks really nice but is CRAP in short order. I thought I was getting a deal but all things considered I overpaid like hell.<br />I do know how to take care of this kind of hair and make it last but it's a lot of work. To curl it, put it in the style you want using flexirods or or a large circle brush and hit it with a blow dryer. Never wash with shampoo, use cold water and fabric softener... that's right, FABRIC SOFTENER BECAUSE IT'S PLASTIC.<br />I'll upload my video to show the hair burning off like doll's hair later on.<br /><br />Edit: I came back to really express my anger. How do you sell kanekalon, call it remy and not be reported to the better business bureau? How do they even get away with this? Nothing short of robbery. If your hair is on the way and you're reading this, plan for a refund immediately!\n",

      "15224->My 3 reasons not to buy. (Everyone is different go for gold sweetheart) | 2 | 0 | Although I love the commercials because they are hilarious and ultimately what got me to try the product, it was not successful for me. I got 3 varieties in the only scents they had available. Here are my views:<br />1.) The stick deoderant comes out as a cream so you get way too much at one time, and the hard plastic of the applicator was unpleasant.<br />2.) The product stays wet on your skin no matter where you apply. I tried it for 7 days in a row to get an honest impression. My armpits were left slippery and wet after every application until I washed it off. I experimented with losing less of the Lume and I got similiar results regardless of how much I put on.<br />3.) The scents that I got were very old-lady smelling and once I got to really moving the scent mixed with my natural body odor actually left me smelling worse.\n",
      "15229->Not good | 2 | 0 | Does not taste very good. Overwhelmingly sweet. Cloying.<br /><br />One note with the chili. Not spicy chili and no other flavor really rounds it out. Low on acid. One note.<br /><br />Tastes like :panda express' sugar sauce.<br /><br />And don't get me wrong I love sweet baby Ray's bbq sauces. They have some depth. I liked them so I tried this, and now you don't have to.\n",

      "15279->This is such an amazing set of brushes | 5 | 0 | This is such an amazing set of brushes.  These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.  Great case for portability and for freeing up space on your makeup vanity.<br />I received this set of brushes for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the brushes myself.\n",
      "15295->Very nice facial massager | 4 | 0 | This is a very nice facial massager that I really like. It comes with 2 different rollers for your face. This one actually can be battery powered if you are so inclined. The rose quartz rollers are very cooling on your face and you could actually remove the heads, since I wouldn't put the electric part in the fridge, you can put the heads alone in the fridge for extra cooling. This will amplify the effects of this massager and help massage away the puffiness in your face.<br /><br />This is one fantastic find and for just $21, you can find some for a little less than that but I really like the design of this one. This helps on those really tough mornings to massage away the puffiness and help your face shed of some years. Perfect for a gift as well.\n",

If you have multiple people in the house, you can have a color for each person so they don’t get mixed up.<br />The colored side sheds and flakes apart with each use, so that isn’t the best. It makes a mess with each use which isn’t ideal.\n",

      "15365->I was a little confused on finding a piece of orange string in the extension | 1 | 0 | **UPDATE**<br /><br />Originally I had loved these extensions and thought they were great quality. I had even purchased 2 additional sets for future use. After a few weeks, my original set started to feel dry, which I assumed was from curling the hair. I removed the extensions, gave my hair a break, and proceeded with the 2nd set. I did not use any heat and even wore a silk bonnet to sleep to keep the quality of the hair in good condition to last longer.  1 day shy of a week I had to remove them, and was so confused as to how this set was in worse condition and had been cared for better. Now I'm 1 1/2 weeks into the 3rd set, curling on 225° heat, using heat protection spray, and notice that there are strands melted throughout. I am so disappointed because this seller advertised that these extensions are 100% human hair, which isn't true. I never would have purchased them, let alone 3 times if they indicated that it was blended with synthetic pieces.a\n",
      "15372->Easy to use | 4 | 0 | I have purchased a bunch of these and so far have not been disappointed.  They are great because I like to constantly change my nails and can't afford doing gel nails every two weeks.  It does take a little practice.  I would like to point out the following:  1.  They are NOT GEL NAILS.  If you think you will get more than two weeks out of these you are mistaken.  Most of the advertising also says you should get at minimum 4 days.  2.  Very important tip:  once you have put on the nail decal/sticker use the heat from a hairdryer to 'seal' them on.  Pretty much like what you would do for gel nails with a UV lamp.  After the hairdryer, put on a top coat.  3.  I use acetone to take them off and then wash my nails to take off the glue.  Some have a heavier adhesive.<br /><br />I do dishes and type all day and these have stayed on my nails for over a week and the two reasons why I change them is because I want a different look or my nails have grown.\n",

      "15425->Feels nice | 4 | 0 | Let’s start with my least favorite aspect. The packaging. This is a thick thick scrub. I’ve tried multiple ways to get the scrub out of the bottle from squeezing, massaging, to running it under hot water. Frankly the tiny hole in the lid does not make it easy to get the product out. About the only way I’ve been successful is to unscrew the lid completely and then squeeze super hard.<br /><br />That being said the product itself is very nice. It leaves your skin nice and moisturized. Now if you aren’t familiar with using coconut oil, know that it doesn’t completely soak in like traditional lotions. This product uses other natural oils (not coconut), just know that it will leave those oils on your skin & they do not wash away. It doesn’t bother me because that’s what I look for in a great moisturizer. The scent smells great, it’s not overpowering, but it does dissipate rather quickly.\n",

To recharge it, you simply plug the cord into a usb charger and into the shaver. It does not provide a very close shave though. If you prefer a close shave, this may not be the best option for you.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive electric shaver to keep in your car or in your office for emergencies, or if you are looking for one to travel with, this is a good option. The shaver also comes with a pop-up trimmer. Simply push a button on the back of the shaver and a trimmer pops up so that you can shave your neck and around ears.

      "15544->excellent at evening out rosy skin, great smelling tinted mineral sunscreen, great as primer | 5 | 0 | Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin. Not sure what I am feeling. Its odd.. but it doesnt impact overall look, feel, or performance.\n",

I came across this SAISZE Jaw Exerciser which, like the YouTube ads, claim to be a Facial Fat Burner, and eliminating Double Chin Reducer for improved jawlines, so I finally bit it and ordered myself one to try.<br /><br />Unboxing was surprisingly taken aback, since I thought the packaging would be a little more elaborate, better packaging in bubble wraps, instructions, illustration, etc, the kind of packaging that I expect for items bought from my local Dollar Stores. Inside, it contains the blue Jaw Exerciser, anda laynard. Inside the Dollar Store-style plastic bag, there's nothing else. I was trying to figure out where does the laynard go, typically lanyards go inside a tiny holes, for example, on a smartphone. Since there's neither any \"tiny\" holes anywhere nor instructions, I went back to the product page, and looked at the product page photos, so the lanyard goes into the HUGE opening in the center of the Jaw Exerciser. This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />🤔🤔🤔🤔does this thing actually WORK?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the \" softened\" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed 😞☹️😞☹️☹️ Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />☹️😟🙄👎Not Recommended👎☺️☺️😟\n",

You can use them two ways, one way gives you wider more oval shape, if you turn around them around, you’ll get a less wide but taller shape... unfortunately both ways DID NOT SUCK. My guess is that they’re too soft, and too short so it’s too easy and doesn’t offer much resistance.<br /><br />That being said, everyone’s lips are different. So it’s certainly possible that these could work for other people (who maybe have smaller lips), but for me, they were useless.\n",

If you have a mane like mine and it completely loses its mind and goes insanely frizzy after blow-drying this brush won't be of much help to you.

The length is up to my belly button which is consider very long. It's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them tangled.<br /><br />This argan oil shampoo smells very good but I prefer something that is not scented with chemicals which are labeled as &#34;parfum&#34;<br />The scent don't really bother me. The texture is nice and not too thick. Lathers up my hair nicely with a quarter size. Since I have a lot of hair, I have to use a quarter size or more. I scratch and rub my scalp for about 30-50 seconds before I rinse in a bucket. This helps me to clean my hair even better. Instead of just rinse form the shower, which dandruff can still stick in my hair.<br />I am quite impressed with the result. My hair is not too dry not oily at all but moisturized.

It's not the darkest contour product I've used, and I might even want a slightly deeper shade for the dark side, but overall I do like this. It blended in easily,<br />I got the lotus and light brown. I am Asian and have kind of tan skin right now.<br /><br />After some time, I've updated this review and taken off one star because it is harder to blend in than powder contouring products, and I feel like it doesn't stay in place all day as well.<br /><br />Overall would recommend this.\n",

I choose the option for the \"mascara brush\" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.\n",
      "15878->Don’t forget to peel off the cover sheet! | 5 | 0 | I LOVE this mask!!!<br />Don’t forget to remove the top and bottom fishnet-like cover!!! That part is NOT the mask! (See my pictures)<br />It fits like a glove! It feels like thin rice paper(lol) but fits to the skin so good!!<br />I’ve heard so many good thing about Arztin repair cream before and wanted to try but so glad that I tried this mask first!<br />It hydrate my skin so well and made my skin tone even. My skin feel so smooth and moisturize.<br />So many sampleS were included! How generous!!<br />I love this mask so much and am ordering more!\n",
      "15879->Excellent Camera Case! | 4 | 0 | This camera case offers excellent protection as the walls are well padded.  The material appears to be at least highly water resistant as when a handfull of water was poured on it to test it did not soak in.  The dividers can be re-positioned so the case is flexible for the time you can't carry the same thing - or if you change equipment out.<br /><br />The one strap makes for a comfortable and easy carry.  If your looking for a case to carry your photographic essentials, this is one you should consider.\n",
      "15884->great idea, but stays on for short period of time | 3 | 0 | Serves the purpose. very comfortable once you put them on.<br />but only stays on for....maybe a week the most?<br />if you are in Cancun, it will stay on for 1 day.<br />but if you only wear your glasses at home only, in or dry climate, it may stay on longer perhaps.<br />great idea though.\n",

      "15912->Best roll-on for me so far | 4 | 0 | Bought on a trip to Canada and just added 4 to my cart, hence not yet a verified reviewer of this product.<br /><br />My problem is that I'm very allergic to something that is used in virtually all stick deodorants. Some brands I've been able to use for a couple months before the pain occurs and for others, it happens within 10-15 minutes. I've found that only the liquid roll-ons are pain free but most provide no benefit. This one works well.<br /><br />Once it warms up and I can get back to heavy gardening in the heat, I'll try to remember to update this review as to how well it controls odor. I'm hoping for the best.\n",
      "15921->Not good for my eyes. | 1 | 0 | I can overlook the extra effort needed to navigate the bottle, and the sometimes wasted product that results from using that non-user-friendly bottle. But I cannot deal with the blurriness that lasts for hours (!!!)  and makes my eyes feel extra dry and scratchy. I've had puffs of dry kitty litter make their way to my eyes when filling the cat box with new contents...and it's the same feeling.<br /><br />Stupid me. I believed the good reviews and bought a three-pack. Into the garbage they went.\n",
      "15924->LOVE this back scrubber! It comes with adhesive back hooks and a sponge...nice | 5 | 0 | I love this back scrubber, and hung it in my shower as soon as I could.  It is quite long with handles, and each side has a different size brush.  The sponge on a rope is a nice bonus.  I currently have a back brush with a handle, and it does the job but not as well as this product. My back hasn't felt so clean in a long while.  I admit I also use it to scratch my back while in the shower, so relaxing and it doesn't have any points to scratch me.<br />This product is worth every penny of $11.99.\n",
      "15939->Very moisturizing for the eye area. | 5 | 0 | Very moisturizing for the eye area. No irritating scent. Not oily or sticky.<br />I have very sensitive, fussy skin & it likes these.\n",
      "15965->Although honestly - a wash cloth would also work. | 3 | 0 | Although this isn't the most productive cleaning tool, I can see it of some purpose.<br />The vibration modes have some noticeable movement.<br />And if one wishes = this fits good in hand to move around the face for quite a good scrubbing.<br /><br />The teardrop design allows easier cleaning the edges of face to the hair line.<br />And with continual ultrasound movement = the scrubber leavers the face feeling cleansed & massaged.<br />Although honestly - a wash cloth would also work.<br /><br />Don't know that this would actually remove blackheads,<br />other than the fact that it's deep cleaning might clean facial pores.<br /><br />One hr charge = (I think) 12 hr run time.<br />(( which is confusing, \"it can be used about 12 hours, and operated about 300 times\" )))<br />Red light = charging<br />Blue light = done\n",
      "15983->Well-designed; better for longer-haired pets | 4 | 0 | This is a well-designed brush, in that one can press a button and easily removed the accumulated hair.  This slicker brush is about 3 inches across.  The handle is comfortable to hold.<br /><br />I quickly found out that this brush is too large for my kitty Stacey, who is 7.5 pounds and has very short fur.  The prongs on this brush are too long to get close to her skin.  She does not shed much (so no fur on the surface), but she still gets hair balls from vigorously washing herself.<br /><br />I think this brush works better as a detangling and brush for a larger kitty or small-medium size dog with longer fur.\n",
      "16004->Difficult | 2 | 0 | Impossible to keep In Long hair without<br /> An elastic or hair pins. The video must be edited. Takes 2 people & Bobby pins, etc.\n",
      "16014->Try something else. | 3 | 0 | Brushes seem nice quality, but the tip shapes seem less defined in person than in the photo. I find it hard to find a use for most of the smaller eyeshadow brushes as they all have essentially the same shape, and the bristles are quite long. The brush cleaner is very handy and does a good job of getting out built up make up.<br /><br />I could have gone without ordering these brushes, and they will be mainly used for back-up.\n",
      "16021->Easier if your hair is shorter than 22\", but still useful for longer hair | 4 | 0 | These curlers extend out to around 20\" so hair that is any longer than about 22\" will end up having a strange gap between where your roots are and the curl begins, depending on how you place them.  I usually line them up so I have that strange gap, but use it to my advantage and just work things into an updo of some kind.<br />The curlers are flexible and comfortable enough to sleep in, just pop a bonnet on and you're good to go. The ends are topped with a silicone gasket-type end that grips onto your hair, preventing it from slipping once in place.<br />The hair grabber tool is basically a big crochet hook for your hair and has two parts you assemble by snapping them together. It is best to work in small sections, especially if you have thicker/dense hair so you can really maximize the curl these provide.<br />There are 20 in a bag, I'm not sure there's really much difference between the two colors in the bag. The curl this gives is really nice and gives great body after a day of wear.<br />Overall, these are a fun addition and a way to take some time off your hair routine in the morning.\n",
      "16026->Nice for travel, but limited use otherwise | 4 | 0 | These hand wipes are good for traveling or any situation where you might come in contact with something gross and soap and water is unavailable.  I like to pair these wipes with hand sanitizer to help combat dryness from the sanitizer.  I still prefer to use hand lotion over these wipes though.  These wipes make my hands feel softer, but don't help dryness not much.  They are refreshing, but I still want to put hand lotion on after using one of these wipes.<br /><br />The price point of these wipes is high, which is why I don't recommend them for everyday use.  I put one in my purse to use for \"just in case\" situations.<br /><br />I have the unscented wipes, which have a very low odor still.  I can tolerate this odor though and I'm normally very sensitive to odors.<br /><br />Overall, I think these wipes work for certain situations, but since I still need to use hand lotion with them, I probably won't buy more.\n",
      "16027->Loose clamp | 2 | 0 | The clamp on this iron barely holds my hair in, even in small sections. When I twist, the clamp is too loose to hold my hair and it just slides out. The only way to use it is wrapping and holding my hair around it which is not why I bought an iron with a clamp.<br /><br />Disappointed.\n",
      "16028->Heat feels nice, but otherwise not impressed. | 2 | 0 | I wanted to like this product, but overall I'm not particularly impressed with it. The lipstick design is cute, but the entire device is covered in a cheap hard plastic that attracts dust and smudges, and doesn't feel particularly durable. The gemstone tip looks dull and cloudy, and has bubbles within it. Not a pretty pink rose quartz like in the product photos.  The stone also doesn't feel perfectly smooth, but somewhat coarse or tacky.<br /><br />I'm not really certain what the difference between the red and blue light modes is; They both seem to head the gemstone head. The 'button' being a touch sensor makes it easy to switch modes on accidental during use. Perhaps one of the biggest flaws of this device is that the motor is in the base, and the vibrations are extremely weak. This means that you can barely feel the vibrations at all during use. Additionally, the charging port is completely exposed on the bottom of this device with no water-resistant cover, so there's the potentially to accidentally get liquid on it if using this product to encourage product absorption.<br /><br />Overall, I'm highly disappointed with this product. I think it's a really cool idea, and the heat emitted from the stone feels nice, but I feel like the overall execution of this product is poorly done.\n",
      "16032->It stays put | 3 | 0 | I bought this one because the one I had originally was no longer available..<br />Personally I don't like the way it goes on .. with a little bit of tweaking I make it work..<br />It definitely stays put..<br />Not a bad product though..\n",
      "16051->smells very strong of perfume | 3 | 0 | smells very strong of perfume, like lady perfume, very very strong. leaves hands smelling very strongly.<br />quality is good but very strong perfume\n",
      "16055->A WASTE OF MONEY!! | 2 | 0 | This hair is very disappointing. Notice that the Good reviews are from 2019, nothing this year so their quality has decreased tremendously. I gave 2 stars because of the soft texture. As you can see from the pictures, the closure has short strands at the front as if it was razor cut, and is very thin. IT is maybe 10 inches long although I paid for 16 inches. I tried to lift it to a honey blonde however the highest it would lift is to a reddish auburn. This was disappointing because its the whole reason why I bought this hair so that I could make a honey blonde wig. It also does not hold a curl long. Many pieces through the bundles are short. I've bought 8a hair before and never experienced this type of problem.<br /><br />UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY....After only 2 weeks the hair won't even hold a curl. It falls after 10 minutes and looks a stringy mess. This cannot be human hair!! Such a waste of money!!\n",

      "16065->VERY Small Bottle, But Works Well | 5 | 0 | I have been looking for some shampoos to help with cleaning hair, but also making the scalp heal for nice hair growth and also flaking.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes wrapped tight in plastic with the pump down.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />Once the plastic is open, you turn the pump to make it pop up and then you can dispense the shampoo.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The bottle is only 6 inches from the base to the top of the pump.  It is pretty small.<br /><br />SCENT<br />My mom found a really old bottle of shampoo in her attic that was by Fabrege called Farrah Fawcett shampoo.  This scent reminds me of that.  It is a really nice smelling shampoo.<br /><br />SCALP<br />I did feel some tingling in my scalp when using this.  It did not burn or hurt at all, it felt nice.<br /><br />HAIR CLEAN?<br />I have very fine hair which is easily weighed down.  It is hard to find a shampoo that encourages volume, does not make my hair look flat, and that does not make it full of static.  This shampoo leaves my hair clean for a few days and it somewhat encourages waves.  I can not comment on static, as it is not near winter yet.  My hair was not left dry or frizzy at all.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shampoo.  It is a small bottle, but a little bit goes a long way.  It makes my scalp feel better and leaves my hair nice and clean.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I wish the bottle was not so small, but I do like the shampoo.  I was going to give this to my daughter (she has scalp issues) but I think I will buy her a 2nd one and keep this one for me.\n",
      "16072->Maria not satisfied. | 2 | 0 | Not to happy with this purchase. I ordered because of reviews. Did not like quality of soap as well the smell. Just ok. Will not purchase again.<br />Came very pretty with bag and ribbon but just ok.\n",
      "16111->Leaks terribly | 1 | 0 | Another design disaster from Philips.  When the old Sonicare died I didn't feel like buying another since they still use Ni-Cad batteries which were state of the art in the Eisenhower era but no longer.  This portable brush has the potential to be perfect.  It requires no base, no cord, no electrical outlet.  The batteries are always as fresh as you want.  Use any AA batteries - rechargeable, disposable, lithium.  Heck, even Ni-Cads if you can find any.  It's perfect for traveling.  It can be stored horizontally.  It takes the regular Sonicare heads.<br /><br />But its from Philips.  I read all the reviews about it leaking so I was very, very careful.  And when that didn't work, I tried running electrical tape around the bottom.  To make a long story short, there are tiny channels that the water still gets in and after a week or so, the bottom cap wouldn't even stay on.  A huge disappointment because I really liked it more than old Sonicare.  Now I'm hooked on true cordless so I'll have to check the other brands.\n",
      "16138->You get what you pay for | 2 | 0 | I knew going in that these won't last very long, so no massive surprise. They are super thin, too thin for the length, and very sheer, so you will definitely see glue and air bubbles. The sheer tint also looks odd because of the visible gap between the nail bed and the white tip in any type of light. The white wears off very quickly, as well.<br /><br />I got these because I am trying to repair damage I did but filing and clipping the edges of my nail bed progressively too thin for the last few years and basically want something to cover my nails for a few months while they grow out and regain the natural width. However, if these don't last more than 5 days, I may have to suck it up and buy name brand nails because the glue damage from removing and reapplying more frequently could defeat the purpose.\n",
      "16143->Bargain face mask that feels great | 5 | 0 | This is a very nice face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face and let sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses. It feeds your skin it feels like with the serum it contains and leaves your skin soft and healthy. Your face will look and feel great. This is a nice little treat for yourself. You will get 10 masks in this pack which is actually a really nice deal.\n",

      "16156->Eh. | 2 | 0 | When this arrived in the mail, I pulled it out by the handle and the brush split apart. The black stem wasn't properly glued into the silver part. So now I have a very short brush that works decently well.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, I guess. I'm going to use this for now, but it's worth it to spend a few more dollars and get something better quality.\n",

Sia's however was great. Soaked in and didn't feel like it was sitting on top of my skin.<br /><br />Super easy to layer with other products.\n",

Van Gogh<br />was so talented !<br /><br />The mirrors are very clear to look into,<br />and this item is quite heavy, not cheap plastic, a quality item.<br />I would purchase it again and also recommend u get one for your purse,<br />and a couple more for gifts. Nice gift considering the quality and<br />economical price.\n",
      "16230->Terrible. | 1 | 0 | The brushes have a stabilizing attachment that has to be installed.  The plastic is brittle.  The attachment breaks or the brush breaks.  If the attachment breaks, the brush is flimsy and will not work to well.  If the brush breaks then hair will get caught and be pulled out.<br /><br />Not good, not even worth a star but Amazon made me choose one to write the review to save you money.\n",
      "16234->Synthetic blend? Lasted one month... | 2 | 0 | Purchased hair and installed a traditional sew in on 3/16/19.<br />I did a deep condition and sealed wefts. Bundles were full, no shedding and silky.<br />Week two:  I went to my back stylist for a refresh, hair was still silky, no tangles, I could run my fingers through my wand curls.<br />Week four: I began to notice frayed ends that looked bushy and nest like. I ran back to my stylist for another wash and set. My hair became very TANGLED during the wash. It was tangled at the beginning of the track and tangled at the ends. My stylist almost broke her brush trying to fix it, the hair was shedding like CRAZY and she was pulling out hairballs from her brush.  She finally combed it out, cut off the dead ends and worked a miracle but the hair still feels ROUGH like a synthetic blend and I'm not able to run my fingers completely through without catching. This hair is just OK and will last you no more than three weeks...I will uninstall after Easter.\n",
      "16246->I guess it depends on what u wanna do with it. | 2 | 0 | 10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for \"freshening up\" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75\" x 3.5\" x 4.25\".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.  I hope this was helpful.\n",

I can't say that I experienced a change in my aging skin but I also haven't been using it very long. There is a nice scent that is pretty much gone once the product has been rinsed off.<br /><br />I  have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues using this.\n",

But not all of the ingredients are listed in the product information. I am allergic to beeswax, which is the second ingredient in the lip balm. So I was unable to use it.<br /><br />I’m including a picture of the tube, but for reference, here are the ingredients: helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, beeswax/cire d’abeille, olea europaea (extra virgin olive) oil, aroma (flavor), cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), aloe barbadensis.\n",

      "16305->It’s a decent idea, it worked, but not with the included suction cups | 4 | 0 | I drive my wife nuts when I trim my beard in the bathroom - I try to catch all the clippings, but without something like this, it does not work well. I thought I”d give this a try - it seems like a great idea, but...<br /><br />1. It arrived with 1 plastic bib, 2 suction cups with hooks, and 1 shaving cream brush.<br />2. The plastic bib feels okay - it’s a thin plastic, but it should last for a decent amount of time. It is not as nice as most of the kinds I’ve experienced or we own for haircutting<br />3. Its stitching is okay - I think it’ll last decently<br />4. There are two loops on the ends you will attach to the suction cups.<br />5. The suction cups - are worthless. This is why it gets the 4 stars - I would have given it 3 stars if we didn’t have our own suction cups to use instead of theirs. One of the two that came with it stuck for 5 - 10 seconds before it stopped working altogether. The other suction cup doesn’t even look right - it looks like it never worked and was not made properly.<br />6. We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I’ll end up taping them to it - at least that way I’ll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape. The white looks weird - I’m used to the far more common black - but at the same time I think it’ll show the beard hair really well.<br />8. I did notice that as I go in closer to the mirror to see what I’m doing it folds over in front of me and isn’t as trapped out - be aware of this because it’s easy to start missing the catch in the bib.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent thing to have and it’ll make my wife happy not getting the beard clippings all over the place. This could be a little nicer -  a little thicker plastic, much better suction cups - which would easily earn it a 5 star rating. But for what it is, I’m happy to have it. If it lasts, it’ll be great.\n",
      "16308->Cute Idea But The Horn Isn't Centered With The Ears | 3 | 0 | What you get - 3 Unicorn style spa-style terry headbands.<br /><br />Pros - these are cute and make a change from the normal bow or cat ear styles.<br /><br />Cons - The ears don't sit equally either side of the horn and they aren't moveable. The bands are also smaller than others I have. Even though they don't say they are designed for children I feel that these may have been designed that way.<br /><br />Overall - a little overpriced for what you get but might make fun teen party favors if they are having a spa or make up party.\n",
      "16316->Too strong for me. | 2 | 0 | I am not very picky about my hand soap, most of them do the same job. This does as well. It lathers nicely and washes well without leaving a greasy feeling.<br /> But unfortunately for me, the scent is too strong and makes me kinda nauseous. This might not be a bigger problem for others but it is for me.<br />And I don't mean to sound ignorant, but what is Novid-19 series? They don't really explain that. Does it mean No-Covid? Is there something I'm missing? Seems to me like some made up B.S. that would attract the customer to buy a $20 bottle of hand soap.<br />Sorry guys. In all honesty, I cannot recommend this.\n",

I had big letters on my booty for a holiday routine and they were made of craft foam - I was really worried that the tape wouldn't be strong enough given the quote convex surface and the amount the needed to flex. Every corner stayed down tight all through the show and after.<br />After the show I let them &#34;dry out&#34; for next time and they quickly lost all their adhesive which was great so little hairs and dust didn't stick and then I'd reapply a new layer of tape for the next show - with every show the letter pasties got more sturdy!\n",

I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price. Another cheapie I really like is Essence, which has both waterproof and non waterproof options: https://www.amazon.com/essence-Princess-Effect-Mascara-Cruelty/dp/B00T0C9XRK\n",

It adds texture and re-styling ability to my hair without making it look greasy and unwashed.<br /><br />My only complaint is that's it's pretty easy to use too much.  I use just a little (not even a pea size) and it's great, but if you use just a tiny bit more then lord have mercy my hair feels like a helmet on my head.\n",

      "16610->Acrylic girl tries Polygel for the first time...crazy different! | 4 | 0 | This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro \"lift proof\" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.\n",
      "16611->Five Stars--Revised to 2 stars... | 2 | 0 | Revised review:  I did everything correctly in preparing my pits for this paste. I tried, and stopped, and tried and stopped...because I was breaking out in painful rashes after about a week or two of wearing the paste.<br />I thought it was just me, but then my husband started using it, and after a month, same thing happened to him. He eventually got a huge infection under his arm. I cannot say with certainty that this due to pit paste. But ours went in the trash. I went back to using Crystal Body deodorant, and have never had a single issue with it.<br /><br />Original review:  I love this stuff!

      "16666->Beautiful color and curls, but hairline not a natural appearance | 4 | 0 | I've been a topper wearer for several years and wanted to go with a full wig for a special occasion.  Right out of the package, I was impressed with the beauty of this wig.  The Ombre coloring is very attractive, and the curls are simply gorgeous.  The only problem that I had was that the hairline just doesn't promote a natural appearance.  I tried to blend the hairline with my own hair, but nothing I seemed to do made this look even remotely natural.  I think this is a very nice wig, but I will probably only be able to wear this using a headband or scarf until or unless I can figure out how to make the hairline more natural appearing.<br />Pros:<br />+The cap has a nice weft with breathable layers.  It is adjustable with nice combs to help secure the wig.  While I wore it, the wig felt secure without being tight.<br />+The synthetic hair is a decent quality with beautiful curls that really only required finger-combing to make them look very nice.  I saw no fraying or damage to the ends.<br />+This wig laid nicely on my shoulders and made me feel very attractive outside of the issue with the hairline.<br />Cons:<br />-As I've mentioned, the hairline doesn't really allow a very natural appearance.  Even if I were to think the hairline, I just don't see this appearing natural.  It could really use a lace front.<br />-I'm used to relatively lightweight toppers.  The density and length of the hair made this much heavier than I was used to.  While the cap was comfortable, I think If I were to wear this for any length of time, I might get a headache.\n",

      "16699->Hot-Comb in a Plastic Cage | 3 | 0 | Not bad....<br />First know that this is a hot-comb in a plastic cage.<br />The cage helps to reduce the number of accidental burns (ears, fingers, scalp, etc.), but, it also makes it a little harder to do the best job on roots.<br />My hair is fine but fuzzy so I used the 3rd setting, which worked very well, but it is a little harder to guide hair through the cage than through a regular hot-comb. My hair is short so I could not use this product to curl it.  Not to worry, I just finish up my hairstyle with a hot curling brush real quick.<br /><br />The whole process takes about 10 minutes to straighten and another 10 to curl.<br /><br />The on/off switch is in an awkward spot and sometimes gets turned off by accident while using.  I really like the shape of the handle.  It is not bad to manipulate and no hot spots.  I love the cord.  It is thick and has not tangled.  I wonder about the plug: two shiny prongs of equal size.  Hopefully meets electrical safety code.\n",

My skin felt nice and moisturized when using this. I don't really have a lot of dark spots so it is tough to tell if those are lightened when using this cream.\n",

      "16754->Serum works but pump doesn’t | 3 | 0 | The product itself works okay around my eyes as the listing stated it would and helps my under eye area look noticeably better.  It blends easily into the skin, and I did not need to use very much.  I like that you can also use it on your entire face if needed.  I tried that also, and found that while it brightens my face a bit, I do still need to apply a moisturizer over it to get proper hydration for my dry skin.  This serum has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent which is pleasant.<br /><br />Sadly, the pump dispenser on the bottle I received does not work at all. It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.  This serum is very thick and more like a gel, so it is way too thick to tilt the bottle and expect a drop to come out.  The defective dispenser pump was a disappointment.\n",

      "16978->Only 2 cats liked it | 2 | 0 | 2 of my cats regularly walk under a U shaped wire brush toy to groom themselves. Another likes to go chew on the brush. The 4th cat always grooms his chin on a prickly squishy ball.<br />The brushes that arrived are hard plastic. Instructions were not included, so I had to revisit the website before pouring catnip in the back of the wall brush. Everyone sniffed it but only 2 tried to rub up against it. At first I had it secured to the bottom of a stool, but once I attached it higher up the legs, the cats nudged at it. It’s been in the cat room for over a week. The cats have not paid it much attention. I moved near the other grooming toys, but no improvement. Maybe the catnip is not so potent or maybe I need to pour the entire bag inside? Not sure? Will continue to move brushes to new locations & see if interest gets peaked.\n",

That's it.<br />I was looking for the metal contacts from the charger to the<br />bottom of the Oral B.<br />But the main reason I wanted this is good sonic power.<br />Didn't get it here.

      "17037->Very comfortable and fit well | 5 | 0 | We have now all been dealing with COVID for some time now and sadly have gotten used to wearing masks. At work I have to wear these types of surgical face masks as part of our PPE in the lab. When I saw these for this price I figured it was worth getting to have some disposable ones around. I have some cloth masks but they should be washed and when I forget or they are in the wash it is nice to have a back up.<br /><br />You get this convenient box with 50 disposable masks in it. I really like that you get this in a box so they are easy to use. In the box you get 5 bags of 10 masks each which is great. So you can actually take one of these bags and keep them where you need them, very convenient.  These are similar to the ones we use at work and these work. These fit well and are comfortable. They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now. They do have the little metal clip on the nose so you can make them fit properly which a lot of people don't usually do for some odd reason, but especially if you have glasses you really should take advantage of that. The loops around the ears were plenty big so no complaints there.\n",
      "17039->Seemed like a good idea at the time. | 1 | 0 | I loved the super-thin brush to create an ultra-fine line. but it's not enough to keep the entire lash attached. Even the smallest ones are too large and applying several coats just results in a thick, messy tacky line. I have hooded lids and it transferred the upper lid in the blink of an eye.  The eyeliner itself is nearly impossible to remove. I applied it on my hand and had to use a stiff scrub brush in order to remove it.<br />I tried a few sets of magnetic lashes and only one performed fairly well, but this wasn't one of them.\n",
      "17069->Worked for my Border Collie | 5 | 0 | Last winter, I noticed that the fur on my Border Collie was dulled, thinning, and itchy for the dog. I used this product as directed and his beautiful black coat returned. I reduced the amount in the spring as I thought it was a winter problem, but no, it came back. I put him back on the full dose and it worked again.<br /><br />Simple to use, tasty, and effective.\n",
      "17078->Just Okay | 2 | 0 | I purchased the 3 pack from this seller some time back.  This powder is okay, but as many others have correctly observed, the scent does not \"match\" the wonderful scent of the soap.  The three I received were also nearly expired, which given the price point was unreasonable.  At this price point, each container should be very fresh.<br /><br />Also, there is something in this that caused an allergic reaction in me.  I applied liberally after I bathed one night and later went to bed.  Lying in bed with my face touching or almost touching my arms/shoulders, I almost immediately began to feel a burning sensation.  I leapt out of bed and looked into the mirror.  My face was very red and had a burning sensation all over.  I can wear this powder so long as I do not get it close to my face, so I do not wear it to bed anymore where my face can come into contact with my arms/shoulders whilst I sleep.<br /><br />The scent is not bad, but it is a bit \"perfumey,\" and it does not match the wonderful scent of the soap.  In the final analysis, I would never repurchase this for myself or probably for anyone else.\n",
      "17109->Great straightening brush. | 5 | 0 | I never brush my hair, because, when I do, it just becomes a very frizzy mess. I was worried this brush was going to provide the same results. I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410°F-446°F (210°C~230°C) for fine hair.<br />374°F-410°F (190°C~210°C) for normal hair.<br />338°F-392°F (170°C~200°C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback. The opinions expressed in the review are solely mine.\n",
      "17149->Exceptionally well-made and beautiful pocket sized brush | 5 | 0 | This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.\n",

      "17193->Best For PM As A Little Heavy & Greasy, Boosts Moisture Well & Skin Feels Soft, Light Lavender Scent | 4 | 0 | Dose of Colors Cold Pressed Booster Multi-Use Oil agrees well with my dry, sensitive skin. I do find this Booster oil a little heavier than some other facial oil blends, but it doesn’t bother me as I tend to use facial oil blends of this type at night, and my skin is dry enough that I can use this during the day. I just have to be careful not to apply too much. When I add a little oil to my cream, I get extra moisture and the oil makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.<br /><br />This Booster has a high percentage of squalane (about 44%). It’s one of my favorite ingredients as it adds extra moisture to my dry skin and makes my skin smooth and soft. For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it’s so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I’d rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br /><br />At night, I’ve tried this Booster oil various ways. I’ve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I’ve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream. I feel there’s no right or wrong way, but I like it best added after my night cream as I can use all my regular products yet I also get an extra boost of antioxidants and moisture that can soak protect and nourish my skin all night. I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it’s too strong. Luckily, it’s subtle enough not to cause an issue. In fact, this Booster oil doesn’t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all. Like it a lot. 4.5 stars. Made in Canada.\n",
      "17197->Good Stuff :) | 4 | 0 | I usually don't wear much when it comes to lip colors, how ever this set seemed liked a great purchase so I figured why not. When I do wear lip colors I prefer stains or doing what I did in high school which is finding a favorite lip liner and using that as my lip color. Color my lips in with the liner and use some Burt's Bee on top.<br />This set all in all is a good purchase, some of the colors are close to repeat but not an exact repeat which for me and my skin tone is great. I'm not sure how each box comes but my box seemed to have a good amount of nudes, mauves, and a few reds. All the colors seemed to work great for me. The colors lasted, didn't bleed and looked great on.\n",
      "17211->Not impressed | 2 | 0 | I am disappointed in these hair bands. When they arrived, the gold band was stretched to be much bigger around than the multicolored band. I thought the gold one was probably of no use but it actually fit my head and stayed in place. Trying the other one on, I found that the ends that fit near the ears were very rough and got caught in my hair. I lost several strands of hair trying to get it off my head.<br /><br />Looking closer at the bands, they are made differently and that is why one appear to be stretched out. The gold one has a ribbon, or something like it, sewn over the ends. The colored one does not and so my hair catches on the little jewel things every time I try it. This is very disappointing. While I was looking the colored band over, trying to figure out why it caught in my hair, I noticed that the jewel pieces were already starting to come off the band on the top.<br /><br />The gold band is wearable at this time, the other one is not.\n",
      "17244->Cute but room for Improvement buttons fall off | 3 | 0 | These are cute,<br />the button fell off right away<br />The black one,<br />felt a little tight!<br />My head is only 52cm<br />So if it feels tight on my head then?<br />I liked the concept!<br />The buttons seem,<br />to be in the wrong places too!<br />Maybe smaller buttons?<br />That are sewn on properly!<br />These are sewn on poorly!<br />They look nice, Material is soft!<br /> I just think they need a little bit of tweaking to work better.<br />I would have given more stars had the buttons worked!<br />and where consistent in sizing!\n",
      "17254->A bit thin and liquidy | 3 | 0 | I bought this thinking that it would be nice and thick since it's an amplifier and can supposedly be used under lipstick, but it's kind of watery and thin, so I don't think I could use it under lipstick at all.  I've found that it stays on better if I apply it and then tap another coat onto my lips with my finger and spread it out.<br /><br />Also, the citrus taste/smell tends to sting if your lips are chapped, and I haven't noticed any amplifiying properties about it whatsoever.<br /><br />It's an OK product, but there are definitely better balms and amplifiers out there and so I know I won't re-purchase this.\n",
      "17263->Fancy but excellent | 4 | 0 | Indeed, for a while we thought then name was slightly misspelled because the product is somewhat fancy. It's clearly  a good quality sunscreen and experience has shown us that the odds for a Korean cosmetics product to be good are quite... good.<br />This sunscreen appears to be no exception. Texture is light and face feels good if used when spending a few hours at the pool or at the beach, and we tried both. And, yes, this is for face only, mostly because there's not much of it and it's not exactly cheap so enjoy it while it lasts.\n",
      "17293->Pretty soft color. | 5 | 0 | I love this soft pink color. Perfect for a light makeup.<br />It run smoothly on the lips, I do use a primer  before because I have very dry lips.<br />It last at least all morning and then all afternoon.<br />Even if the color is soft, the lipstick have a good pigmentation.<br />No weird scent.<br />I like it!<br />Recommended.\n",
      "17322->Not for me | 3 | 0 | The pony tail holders are great fashion statement.  However, their weight is a little over powering.  They pull and tug on your hair<br />and if you try to pull the pony tail to the top of your head, you can feel the excessive weight on your head.  I would pass on this one.  Cute, but way too heavy to be practical\n",
      "17345->Arrived broken. | 2 | 0 | The silver clip arrived broken. I'm trying to fix it myself. For the price, 2/3 intact pieces isn't bad, but ideally you'd want to be able to use everything pictured.<br /><br />The gold one is also more of a matte/satin finish.\n",
      "17347->Nice wig | 4 | 0 | This was a cute wig, but it just wasn’t right for.<br />If you have the right head or face shape it can look pretty cute.\n",
      "17353->This stuff works great | 5 | 0 | As advertised. No bat wings. Keeps you fresh with no discomfort. Not greasy or oily.<br />This product actually works.  Worth the price.\n",
      "17363->Packaging needs to be better. | 3 | 0 | The packaging is bad !!<br />The bottles are nice and tight at the bottom in a thick foam, but only at the bottom.<br />They kinda hit/touch at the top.<br />The caps and the strayer heads are loose.\n",
      "17372->Pretty shadow.  Make sure you look at the ingredients! | 4 | 0 | This Hynt Beauty Perfetto Pressed Eye Shadow Single in Sunlit Dune is absolutely stunning for a neutral color.  Has a nice shimmer and a smooth feel to it.  It blends well and feels like it will last the whole day.<br /><br />Only concern is the ingredients.  What is on the box and on the actual container differs a bit--see pictures.  Not a problem for me, but if you are sensitive to a specific ingredient you should probably reach out to Hynt to determine which one is correct.\n",
      "17378->Don’t bother | 1 | 0 | Normally I like NYX products but not this one. It leaves a funny coating on your eyebrows and pushes them down so much they look thinner than they are.<br />Not worth it.\n",
      "17383->Just OK | 3 | 0 | Just OK. I like that I have 3 options (pink, peach, and bronze), but palettes are poorly designed IMO - clunky and large, and the square/rectangular shaped brush is a throw away. Soft enough, but the shape is awkward - who wants to apply blush or bronzer in a stripe pattern? :/<br /><br />The quality is average - not a huge amount of color deposit for the amount used, but I don't mind this so much since the overall effect is subtle, which I prefer in a blush. Medium amount of fall-out/mess.\n",
      "17386->Great! | 5 | 0 | Works great.<br /><br />Recommended!\n",
      "17387->Easy to use | 4 | 0 | One of those pesky grooming routines that men and women deal with is nose hair (and as men get older, ear hair). No one wants to look like Sasquatch (well most of us, at least). So, we trim; this is the first trimmer I have ever used and I am happy. It is light weight, barely more than the AA battery it requires. It is reasonably quiet, certainly less noise than my electric razor.<br /><br />I have yet to have a pulled hair in my use, my technique is to use slow, smooth movements, no fast twisting. The results are acceptable with no long hairs (note, I don't expect this device to shave the inside of my nose, just trim the hairs).<br /><br />Overall, a good trimmer. The cleaner brush is tucked inside the battery compartment. P-)\n",
      "17388->Pretty pleased overall, the bunnies are nice quality and the suction cups work great! | 4 | 0 | I'm pretty pleased overall with these cuties. The bunnies are made from nice quality silicone. They're nicely sized and amply thick so the various textures on top are substantial enough for cleaning brushes. Each one has four suction cups on the back and they actually stick extremely well. It's a little tricky lining them all up so that these stay perfectly flat but it's doable. The colors of the bunnies are true to the product pictures so I disagree the green one could classify as mint. It's really more of a dark teal, but I still it.<br /><br />This set comes with four makeup sponges. I don't often use those so I'm no expert but these seem a little cheap to me as they came with some dents in them. I also didn't get the colors pictured and wasn't aware they would be random. Some of mine, like the brown one, weren't colors I would have picked myself but the sponges weren't really the reason I bought this so personally I'm not too bothered, though I did want to mention it. I really like the bunnies so I'm still happy with the purchase.\n",
      "17427->It's creamy | 5 | 0 | It's nice and creamy and stays on well.<br />Has perservatives and colors so not very natural.<br />Probably won't buy again because of this but it does<br />work well.\n",
      "17430->Fantastic Cream! | 5 | 0 | I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!\n",
      "17431->Good comb, just need a needle and thread. | 4 | 0 | The comb did break when I tried to take it out of my hair the first time that I wore it.<br />I fixed it by reinforcing the end of the loop with needle and thread. I used the comb several times after that.<br />I could even sleep with it. Which was hard to do with a scrunchie.\n",
      "17434->Might be good for kids, but quite small for adults. | 3 | 0 | I've recently started cutting my husband's hair, so I was on the hunt for a cape. This one is definitely going to make do, but I'm disappointed with how short it is on him. It wouldn't even come close to draping over he back of a chair to send the hair sliding to the floor instead of down the back. It's a decent material, and fit his neck (17&#34;), which is nice. It also has a second Velcro area to make the neck much smaller for a child. It is longer in the front than it is in the back which just doesn't make sense to me because most hair that's cut is behind the shoulders. I will continue using this, but I wouldn't buy again.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. The seller nor Amazon provides any other compensation for this review. I personally use reviews any time I purchase something.  I only choose items that I will truly use so I can take the time to provide an honest review that will hopefully help you buyers before making a full priced purchase.\n",
      "17435->Good basic oils, many uses | 4 | 0 | You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal\n",
      "17439->Woodsman smells awesome, the rest aren't that great IMO | 4 | 0 | I like the woodsman sample, that's the one I wanted to try anyway. The other three are not as good in my opinion.<br /><br />-1 another star initially because one of the bottles had a chip out of the bulb which made it impossible to use, but I added that star back since they shipped me a new one almost immediately.\n",
      "17456->Long lasting | 5 | 0 | These khaki brown neutral shadows are a good addition to my makeup palette. My favorite feature of this 6 piece cream eye shadow is that it stays put even when I am sweating. Instead of streaking down my cheeks or blotching in the creases of my eyelids, it really stays on where it is supposed to, especially if I use an eyeshadow primer. The colors are lovely, neutral hues that most people will find complementary to  their skin tone. I have a couple of their eye shadow sets, but this is the one that gets used the most.<br /><br />The pink set is softly feminine with lighter colors to accent daywear. They are perfect for cooler skin tones or as highlights on the eye for warmer tones.\n",
      "17475->Gave my armpit a rash. NOT GOOD! | 1 | 0 | I started using it 10/11/22 and 10/12/22 after a shower, I applied lume for the 2nd time. Both arm pits immediately started burning then became bright red. I washed it off after 5 mins becoz I couldn't stand the burning anymore. Now I have to wait for my armpit to heal before using ANY deodorant. Really disappointed bcoz I like the smell.<br /><br />Plus it changes the PH of your P..if you use it there. Don't recommend using it there. If your PH changes, this causes other negative things ...\n",
      "17483->Very nice toner | 4 | 0 | This is a nice toner. It comes in a nice tall bottle. It doesn’t have some kind of dispensation mode, just a little whole that you pour the toner out from. It is easiest to use cotton pads to use this toner with so that seems to work the best.<br /><br />The toner has a mild but pleasant fragrance. That scent does not linger though. It seems that this toner is very mild. I have had no reactions to it. It felt moisturizing and did not dry out my skin. I do find this to be maybe a bit overpriced though to be honest at $31.\n",
      "17496->Small is useful | 4 | 0 | Surprisingly, this small set, probably the smallest I've seen so far, comes with everything you will need for beard-mustache trimming and it could be used for hair styling for as long as your hair is not too long.<br />I would recommend it as a travel option because of its small and efficient size but it could also be used as the default beard or generally facial hair tool if your needs aren't anything special.\n",
      "17504->Nice clean lemon scent | 5 | 0 | Review for: Lemon Oil Towelettes - 20 Count<br /><br />Each of the wipes is individually wrapped, making them convenient to carry in a backpack or purse. They also make good travel items so I can wipe down my armrest and tray if flying.<br /><br />The wipes have a pretty strong but pleasing lemon scent so if you don’t like the smell of lemons, you won’t like these. They are just large enough to clean my hands. After using one, my hands feel a bit sticky but once they dry, the stickiness goes away.\n",
      "17509->Waste of $$$ | 1 | 0 | Junk, each tube worked one time. The tip is not slanted so it's awkward to use..<br />One star because zero isn't an option.\n",
      "17514->Once the smell is gone it's GREAT! | 4 | 0 | It's beautiful and seems highly functional, the only problem I'm having at all is the smell is SO bad that I had to spray it with air freshener, clean it off and contain it in a small container to try to cut the horrible smell down....I've only owned it for a little over 10 minutes and already half of my home has the weird plastic/chemical/ leather smell like the case.<br />24 HOUR UPDATE:<br />Ok, after multiple sprayings with air freshener and multiple cleanings.... I finally have the strong plastic/chemical mixed with leather smell under control. (The leather smell I've always really liked, it was the plastic/chemical smell that was killing me!) and now that I have that problem under control I REALLY love this case!! I use tarblock tips on my cigarettes (which are quite small) &amp; normally have to put a few at the bottom of my cigarette case making access to them a pain in the butt....but now I have one zipper compartment for my tips AND another one for a pack of matches in case my lighter dies and extra bandaids....Also I LOVE how well the lighter pocket holds the lighter, I even tried shaking it upside down and it didn't budge! VERY nice!! If it weren't for the smell issue I'd give this case 5 stars!!\n",
      "17516->it's OK but not satisfied | 2 | 0 | This chair is comfortable in the cushion but the wheels do not roll smoothly so makes it awkward to move around while tattooing.  it also does not lower down enough, it's actually quite high even at it's lowest level.<br />good price though.\n",
      "17522->Great value but a bit thick for my liking! | 4 | 0 | I get massage almost everyday coz of all the pain I have. This is very good to have if you use a lot of lotion and don’t need much to glide while you’re massaging. It’s a bit thick for my liking so a small amount can go a long ways, which is good if you’re trying to make this lotion last you a long time.<br />Doesn’t seem to clogged my pores specially in my back where I get pimples so that’s a good thing. For the price this is a good buy.<br />No skin irritation experience so that’s a good thing.<br />Beside the texture, I am happy with the overall experience with this lotion.\n",
      "17524->Color | 2 | 0 | The stencils were ok, however the color did not show on my eyebrows at all. I had to use I<br />Eyebrow pencil to fill in the color.\n",
      "17544->Tiny, But Mighty! | 5 | 0 | Don't let the small size (5.4 ounces) fool you. It's just a bit more than half a cup, but the super fine mist it makes means that it's going to last for quite a while. I don't like using the steam option on my iron because it can sometimes make a mess and often makes the fabric much wetter than I want. This little bottle just barely moisten the fabric and a quick pass with my iron sets and dries immediately.<br /><br />I know the intended purpose for the bottle is hair related, so I tried it for that as well. Oh, my! Again, it barely moistens my hair and a quick pass with my hair dryer sets it immediately.  it's a twofer!\n",

      "17569->This is nothing but an expensive spray that has a pretty scent that lasts for a half hour. | 1 | 0 | Update<br />This product is a giant rip off. It does not smooth out my pup's hair, smells pretty for a very short amount of time, and it's like a nothing product for a lot of money. I do not recommend wasting your money on this. I even called IGroom and they said it would smooth out frizzy dog's hair. Well my pup is a Shih Tzu, doesn't have frizzy hair, but thought it would at least smooth her hair out straight, mostly on the ears and tail, but truthfully is doesn't do anything. I won't buy again.\n",
      "17584->Nice middle of the road set | 4 | 0 | I was hoping there would be a price available at the time of this review, but currently it wasn't posted. Bath bombs come in a range of prices and quality, without a price it's hard to say if this is a good value. Kiddo loves bath bombs, but he values toys and water coloring over quality of skin softening or scent. So for this set he was not of any help. I tried one and found it to be nice but not as skin softening as some of the bigger ones I've tried. These are really more midline as the fizz is just average, scent was alright and not off putting but not amazing.<br /><br />If these are under $15 I'd say great value, above $20 and I'm not sure they are worth it, but not a terrible deal.\n",
      "17597->This week is only good if you just want a night out | 3 | 0 | This wig starts out nice but after a week of daily use it becomes super frizzy and the last 6 to 8 inches of the ends dont look like hair anymore...<br />Tried a gentle shampoo and a wide tooth comb and still looks bad.. but if you just wanted to use it for one or two nights it would be all right..\n",
      "17601->Beware! - UPDATED Review | 3 | 0 | I am a licensed nail tech in KS and I bought these to ease the \"last minute, I want nail art\" issues.  I use other nail foils and they work perfectly.  I cannot get these to work.  Doesn't matter if I use foil glue or any other method.<br />**UPDATE - only the pretty holographic ones are not working.... the colored foil sheets are working.  Updated rating from a 1 star to a 3 star.\n",
      "17619->Good product, but pictures don't match what you receive | 3 | 0 | I really like how these turned out. They are nice quality, with several sizes. Though, i tried ro recreate the picture and there wasnt a snowflake big enough for my pinkie finger, so had to improvisw<br /> I have no issues with the product itself. But, like many other reviews, the picture is misleading, and it does only include the blue snowflakes. The small description above the picture is correct, not the picture of both sets, which is unfortunate because I thought I was getting a better deal getting two sets for the price, guess that's on me.\n",
      "17640->Christmas watch unisex | 1 | 0 | The watch works and it's the right size, but it is so light weight that it feels really cheap.<br />UPDATE: Finally got to put the watch on for the Christmas season and was more disappointed. Top of watch face has 'Merry Chris' on it. Watch stops intermittently, so cannot count on accurate time reporting. Through it in the trash. Should have spent more money on a better watch.\n",
      "17658->Not a fan | 2 | 0 | I has to return this item. It was so uncomfortable. The wire is positioned weird and it doesn't get hot.<br /><br />Update: appreciate seller reaching out! It only means they care for their customers and want to make improvements. I would suggest trying their product and positioning the outlet on the opposite side. I would give it a try myself, however, i dont have an outlet on that particular side.\n",
      "17670->Good enough | 4 | 0 | This doesn't feel like anything fancy. It's a value for money thing. This huge bottle is inexpensive. The pump to squeeze it out works fine. The scent is fine. And it isn't that thin watery substance with cheap brands where most of it just flows right down the drain. I use it to wash my hair.<br />I havent combed my hair since i was 13 and mostly just don't care about it or what I put in it. It's there and it helps keep my head warm. Whatever is in this hasn't caused my hair to fall out. So im calling that a win.<br />Good enough\n",
      "17693->The Smell Is Overwhelming | 3 | 0 | I like the smell of lemon, so I really expected to like this hand soap a lot. Unfortunately, it's not a citrusy fresh lemon scent like I would want for a soap or another product that I'd put on my body. Instead, it reminds me more of a wood furniture polish smell. It's a pretty strong scent too. You can definitely smell it as you are washing your hands. Unfortunately, that smell lingers. I could still smell it on my hands about an hour after washing them. It also seemed to dry out my hands a lot more than other hand soaps that I've been using lately. I found that using a scented lotion on my hands after using this soap did help with both the wood furniture polish smell and with my dry hands.<br /><br />This soap does lather up well. I'm not a fan of the texture, though. For me, it felt like I had a slimy film on my hands. While I'm sure that other people will like this soap, I was not a fan.\n",
      "17727->My favorite nails ever! | 5 | 0 | These Rebecca Minkoff nails are absolutely beautiful! I get so many compliments when I have them on. They last at least 2 weeks, sometimes more. They’re a gorgeous pink ombré with a little glitter in them.<br />Just beautiful!\n",
      "17730->Glue + Eyeliner probably shouldn’t mix | 2 | 0 | Pros: it came with everything pictured, a lash applicator, the tube of “eyeliner glue” and 5 pairs of lashes in varying thickness. The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br /><br />Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br /><br />When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br /><br /> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you’d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes. It doesn’t take any more time to apply and at least you can apply eyeliner to suit your taste.\n",
      "17734->Meh | 3 | 0 | So my package came torn apart. The plastic carry case was completely shattered. When I tried to return, I wasn’t able to because of it being “hazardous materials.” I did get a refund though. I’m shocked all the items made it without losing some. Not sure what happened there.<br />Now to the product, my daughter has never tried poly gel nails. After reading reviews on lots of other sets, this one seemed good for her as a beginner. After following the directions, the nails snapped right off. I don’t think the UV or LED light, whatever it’s called, included in the package, is strong enough to cure them.\n",
      "17739->Works well without irritation | 4 | 0 | I had surgery mid February that left me with 2 incision scars. They are not too bad but still figured I would try to make them less noticeable. I had to wait until the areas were completely healed  per the instructions. I like that the scar cream comes in a pump that comes out easy in small amounts. The smell is a little strong for me but it doesn't stink. To make sure I could tell if it was working or not, I have only been using it on one side. I'm pretty impressed. I have sensitive skin and this had cause no irritation. The aide I have been testing on is flatter than the other one.  I can actually feel the untreated scar but I have to look for the one I used the cream on. The color is also returning back to normal faster than the other. I'm glad to have found something to help because with 6 kids somebody always had a scar of some kind that we need to work on.<br /><br />I received the renewal scar cream free in order to provide honest and unbiased feedback. All statements are based solely on my personal experience using the product.\n",
      "17749->Flimsy | 2 | 0 | I have very fine, long hair, and this is much too flimsy for even my hair.  Perhaps the size I ordered is too large, but I have been buying this kind of bun styler for years from Claire's Boutique. Sadly Claire's no longer sells them.  If you're looking for the same kind Claire's used to sell this one is less than half the girth, making my bun look more like a loose, flat pancake.  I think if I use a lot of product and tease my hair it might work, but I'm looking for something quick and simple to hold my hair up tightly for when I go running.<br /><br />Other than that, I received the product in about a week and a half.  Also, the packaging is as shown in the picture.  It's just hard to tell how thin it is from the angle in the image.\n",
      "17769->Shower cap doesn't  hair dry!! | 2 | 0 | Advertised as keeping hair while in<br />shower they do not I repeat do not my hair dry at all.<br />My is dryer when I get in without the<br />shower cap.\n",
      "17771->Natural plant oils mixed with avocado oil | 5 | 0 | I wanted this oil because it's a blend that contains both lavender and patchouli. I absolutely adore patchouli, although some products that contain it don't have that wonderful incense sent.<br />This blend is delightful. You get the patchouli and spicy lavender mixed with a little bit of citrus as well as yang yang. There is even a touch of nutmeg to add even more warm spice.<br />I also love the elegant dropper, so much nicer than a rubber dropper. The gold top has a button that depresses to dispense a drop at a time.<br />A very special oil. You don't need a carrier because it's already in skin-loving avocado oil.<br />It has a shrink wrap to protect against contamination, as well as to assure that you've gotten a brand new product. Very important to me.<br />Oils can go rancid quickly, and this manufacturer puts an expiration date on the bottom. Any product that can go rancid should have that, but not all do, so that's another great thing about this oil.\n",
      "17772->Puts A Layer Of Silky Smoothness Between You & Your Make-Up | 5 | 0 | N3 No Name Necessary Pore-Minimizing Mattifying Oil and Shine Control Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml) puts a layer of silky smoothness between your skin and your make-up. I have combination skin- some parts dry, regular and oily. I also have aging skin, so I really didn’t think this primer spray would help me, but it surprisingly did. This comes in a spray bottle and you have to shake the bottle well before spraying, keeping your eyes tightly shut.<br /><br />It sprays with a fine mist, but has a foaming in it. After spraying, I gently rubbed it more evenly on my face. It dries instantly and wow, my face felt like velvet. If anyone knows about aging skin- your make-up shows the fine lines and wrinkles more exaggerated. This primer spray somehow smooths your skin more, leaving it like a smooth slate for make-up. I am very impressed with this spray, as nothing helps aging skin like this does for make-up, powder, even  touch up concealers. A wonderful product. 5 STARS.\n",

      "17785->Not bad but not the greatest either | 3 | 0 | You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH. That does make me wonder what it does to that plastic bottle and if over time it will dissolve that plastic bottle.\n",

The directions are accurate.<br /><br />Do not buy this product unless you have an UV light.  I tried using without a UV light out of curiosity. The first polish in the process would not cure without the UV light. FYI.<br /><br />Easy to use and does dry fast with a UV light. Definite advantage.<br /><br />Gel polish is much harder to remove which is good and bad.  Good because it lasts longer but bad when you need to remove.<br /><br />Great price point!\n",

I have one in the bathroom on the counter, one in the kitchen and one on my bedside table. That way any time I need a hand cream this is available. I also use this as a body lotion. This is the one Zum fragranced cream that smells the best to me and the scent dissipates quickly after use. To be honest my hands look ten years younger when using this particular lotion. There are a lot of essential oils in it so I think it is antiaging. I also love the particular scent of the Bulgarian lavender.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

The shampoo does a brilliant job of not only cleansing hair, it cleanses the scalp and washes away buildup leaving hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner detangles, hydrates and adds bounce to even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a nice scent though it doesn't last long, at least not in my hair!  Each is easy to work into hair and rinse out as well.  I like to use this duo once a week. I experience no color fading or allergic reactions as I have sensitive skin.  Definitely worth the price and absolutely recommended!\n",
      "17856->Unique concept! Best for thick hair. Quality just OK. | 3 | 0 | I had never seen a clip like this before so thought I'd try it out.  Look closely at the product pictures; this involves clipping some hair in the bottom, larger clip while leaving loose hair in front, and then dividing the front portion of hair into three parts and clipping into the three smaller, top clips.  Very interesting!<br />It actually looks cuter than I expected, but:<br />-the bottom clip is fairly large and definitely for thicker hair; even the top clips are large-ish considering they are meant to hold just a smaller, 1/3 size section of hair.  So not really made for those with fine/thin hair, including small children with wispy hair.<br />-the quality of these is not awesome.  They are very much junky black plastic with glued-on rhinestones.  There are strings of dried glue on mine--easily pulled off, but still.  Best for maybe a costume party or a child or someone with very dark hair that will camouflage the black plastic so that only the flower clips are noticeable.\n",
      "17860->Very soothing and love using this for when my skin is irritated from the sun | 5 | 0 | This i a very nice inexpensive soothing cream by I Woke Up Like This. It comes in a cute little jar. You get a little spatula with it that allows you to keep the cream nice and untainted and clean.<br /><br />The cream itself smells absolutely fantastic. I really like the fragrance of this one a lot.  The texture of this one is perfect for soothing. It is not really a cream but a combination of cream and gel. It feels fantastic on your skin and if you keep this chilled it will feel even better yet, especially if your skin is irritated by the sun. I found this works for all kinds of irritations really and really like how my skin feels when I use this.<br /><br />It is very lightweight and absorbs very fast into the skin. There is no residue left behind on my skin when I use this. I am a fan and can only recommend this cream. Your skin will thank you.\n",

      "17938->Zero Scent! | 5 | 0 | I got this Nail Polish Remover 100% Natural for a friend who loves nail polish and has a little girl and is always changing colors. She's trying to live a healthy lifestyle so I thought this would make for a nice addition. I love that all the ingredients are natural and it's safe for children. The instructions were easy to follow but not the fastest way to remove polish (especially glitter polish). It's fastest so soak a cotton ball with remover and hold onto the nail.<br /><br />Yes it does take longer than standard nail polish but it's worth it knowing you aren't using chemicals. The best part? ZERO scent. I know for many nail polish remover is an awful smell and can cause headaches so this is a nice alternative for those who are sensitive to scent!<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

      "17943->What an upgrade | 5 | 0 | I usually get packs of cheapola showercaps from the dollar store (like a six pack of plastic bags with a rubberband, you know?) but they don't last long... So I had a vinyl one that lasted longer, but was really just that same old design that was just plastic tied to your head with elastic...<br /><br />This shower cap is... well, frankly, after the other ones I've used... luxurious. The material is not plastic, but more like the soft nylon on my windbreaker jacket. It's much quieter when I'm in the shower, which makes for a more peaceful bathing experience. It is also more comfortable, as the headband is more fitted. It's especially comfortable if you wear it over your ears... there's no pressure anywhere, but it still keeps your hair dry. I, personally, like to have my ears \"out,\" so there is some pressure to the top of my ears where the headband sits, but I don't mind it.<br /><br />The headband does stretch a bit for head size, but not as much as you might be used to if you've used shower caps with elastic bands. I kind of liked this... It makes it easier to get all my hair in it. I flip my head upside down over the shower cap, and the cap just kind of catches my hair like a bucket, and I can just tuck in any stragglers before flipping my head back up. If you need to tighten the headband just a little bit, you can re-tie the bow for a slight adjustment.<br /><br />No shower cap is going to be completely, perfectly water tight. You're always going to get a little bit of water around the edges unless you're really careful in the shower and take pains to avoid direct spray. I use a shower cap when I take a shower before bed and don't want to go to sleep with wet hair... a little bit of moisture doesn't bother me, as I'm not trying to protect a hairstyle or anything. I really just like the comfort and feel of this cap a lot!\n",

      "17980->192 lash clusters, 12mm-18mm | 2 | 0 | The Bodermincer lash clusters, mix 12mm-18mm with 4 rows of each size were not my favorite.  First off, the case that they arrived in was quite large, almost the size of a small tablet with 2 latches that are supposed to lock so the case doesn’t come open but neither works.  The adhesive strip that the clusters are attached to, I had one of the clusters rip apart when trying to remove it from the adhesive strip with eyelash tweezers (grabbed by band like always).  The lash clusters are also very top heavy as you can see from my side shot above picture where the lash drifted out of place after being glued (you need to supply your own glue, not included).  I held each cluster in place with lash tweezers until glue was set because I was having trouble keeping them where I wanted them.  The lash clusters themselves are more of a U shape and very thick at the band with a slight flair going up/out.  They do have a slightly variegated length to them but it’s not super noticeable and the curl on them was more of a C than a D.  Clusters are soft but the band holding them together is sharp and slightly uncomfortable when wearing (I always glue lash clusters underneath eyelid, I think it blends better).<br /><br />When removing the lashes at the end of the day most of the clusters either fell apart of several individual lashes came off the bands.  I would not recommend this particular set of lash clusters.\n",

      "17991->Like the facial roller | 4 | 0 | I have to admit that I don't use the bottles with the crystals although they do look nice. I wanted to try the facial roller. I had another facial roller that I liked but it disappeared so I wanted to see if this one was just as calming and cool.<br /><br />Good news is that the facial roller in the Rose Quartz Massager Facial Roller with Bottles for Essential Oils is cool and calming. I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin. It is easy to clean and it keeps well too. With the two roller bottles, it does make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm keeping. Hopefully this one doesn't disappear.\n",

The nail clipper has no resistance bar & several of the files are peeling from the boards so are useless.<br /><br />Wasn't expecting more than moderate quality at only $13.99 - but not one piece of this kit has more than 1 use in it.

It's also like it starts too narrow down there, so there's slight gapping along the edges, then it becomes too wide for my fingers.

      "18114->Disappointed in these and in myself | 2 | 0 | I should have paid more attention.<br />These are extremely cheaply made.  Stamped out of sheet metal.<br />The handles are molded plastic.<br />The center pivot is a rivet so it cannot adjust when it becomes loose.  Except perhaps by banging it with a hammer on an anvil.<br />The cutting scissor blade is only 2-1/2 inches long.  The thinning is only 2 inches long.<br />Being so small, these are only truly usable by people with small hands.<br />They are delivered on a cardboard card with all writing in (I assume) Chinese except the words \"Stainless Steel\".  Suitable for hanging and sake in a dollar store.<br />These are described as usable in a salon.  I would walk out of a tonsorium if I saw them using these.\n",

The metal is fashion quality and not fine jewelry but the quality is really superb! The necklace is heavy which might bother some people but I like that, it feels very sturdy and well made. The stones and crystals were all intact and had a beautiful color/shine. The piece was packaged extremely well and included the two body chains as well. It also arrived before the estimated date which is always nice. I have shared this necklace on my social media and I already have people asking me wheere I purchased it from so I sent the the amazon link.

      "18137->Great for apply massage oil | 4 | 0 | This jade roller bottle has been great for applying massage oil when I use a gua sha tool on the neck and back of my spouse. It gives the right amount of oil and spreads it around nicely. The jade ball feels very comfortable when rolling it on the skin.<br /><br />Note: the bottle is not sealed so any liquids inside the bottle will flow out if not kept upright.\n",
      "18143->Pretty good spa set, but a bit on the expensive side. | 4 | 0 | Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with my order of this spa set. The first thing I noticed is that everything smells fantastic! A strong coffee fragrance wafts from everything in this kit, and all three body products contain real coffee. The scrub was my personal favorite scent-wise; I find it smells just like a caramel lattee.<br /><br />The body bar is nourishing and non-drying, but it is exfoliating due to the coffee grounds, so I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. I do personally wish it was a tad larger, as it melts down quickly during typical usage.<br /><br />The scrub is quite dense, as it doesn't contain added liquid. However, this means you get a lot for your money, as you only need to use a little bit on damp skin to get good exfoliation.  I like the addition of almond and coconut oil, as it keeps it from being overly harsh, and makes it quite hydrating.<br /><br />A little goes a long way with the bath soak. I love using it in a foot bath; It leaves my feet feeling nice and soft, and the aroma is relaxing and pleasant. It does dye the water a light brown due to the coffee, however.<br /><br />I like the candle, but I'd consider it my least favorite out of this set. It has a nice burn time for its size, and it's in a beautiful black candle tin with a lid. However, I found the amount of scent it provided while burning to be underwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this spa kit, and I think it'd be fantastic for any coffee lover. It's a little expensive at the current price, but if the candle was a little stronger, and the bath bar was a little larger, then this would be a five-star product.\n",

      "18150->Just as good as KONAD....or better | 5 | 0 | I got my nail plates and they are great. I have a few of the name brand Konad nail art plates and they are exactly the same, but better. They have more designs per plate and they have a lot of different designs to choose from. They work just as well as the Konad plates.<br /><br />I would suggest still using the Konad Special polish because like the Konad plates, a lot of regular store polishes don't work so well with the stamper. Metallic nail colors of any brand work well. Also, you can make your nail polish thicker by placing it in the fridge, so that will also help with getting the image to transfer.<br /><br />If you have wide nail beds you'll have to improvise on the full nail designs because they aren't as wide as the Konad plate versions. I only have issues with my thumb and i've fixed it by just putting polish on half the stamp and doing the part that isn't covered with the first stamp.<br /><br />Also, The edges of the plates are kind of sharp, but you could probably take a metal file or dremel and file around the disc's if it bothered you or you were concerned about it. They aren't too bad and since I just set mine on a paper towel I don't notice except when i'm putting it away.<br /><br />They all come with a protective wrapping on them so MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE IT before trying to stamp. it's plastic and i just used my nails to get it to come up off the plate for stamping.<br /><br />The price is amazing and the amount of stamp designs you get is awesome. It's definitely worth the money.\n",
      "18154->Much easier than glue | 4 | 0 | This was my first attempt at using magnetic lashes; there's a small learning curve but oh my gosh - SO MUCH EASIER than the old eyelash glue that comes in a separate tube! They're very comfortable; like any false lashes they feel weird at first but after about 15 minutes I forgot they were there & wore them all day with no issues. They stay where you put them, they DO NOT budge until you pull them off. No glue melting or flaking off into my eyes, obviously that's a big benefit! They look super dramatic with pretty minimal effort.<br /><br />I'm a little confused as to why it's best to apply the lashes when the eyeliner is half-dry but still tacky; is there glue built in to the liner as well as magnets? If you need to reposition them, you have to reapply the eyeliner because the lashes pull some of it off. The eyeliner is very wet when you apply, so be careful - you have to shake the tube before application, and when I pulled the brush out, it spewed eyeliner onto the wall (and it was not super easy to remove). So that's the learning curve part, now that I know I'll avoid those pitfalls.<br /><br />The one unavoidable pitfall is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove. I used 3 different types of makeup remover & still needed to scrub my eyelids for a good 10 minutes to get all of it. Not great for the eyelid wrinkle situation! I slathered on a lot of pampering eye cream afterward because my lids were a little sore. I guess I'm glad it won't wear off halfway through the day, but geez!<br /><br />Anyway, despite the difficulty removing it, I'm pretty smitten. I used to love wearing false lashes but they were just so much trouble that I gave it up a few years ago. Now I love them again & they're easy!! I want to order all the lashes!\n",

I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!\n",

      "18209->Excellent keychain carriers; 2 spray bottles dispense fine mist; flip top ones only okay – 4.5 stars | 5 | 0 | I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the flag colors are vibrant, attractive, and patriotic. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and the flag carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. In addition, I can put in a chapstick (see photo), nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $7.10 is reasonable for this set.\n",

Feels nice when my rosacea has made my face feel warm (I have visible veins/redness from rosacea; no other issues). Excellent for use in the bathtub, or for a mini nap, or simply to help relaxation. Might even be perfect post skin treatment sessions that may leave skin feeling irritated.<br /><br />Stocking stuffer!! I love how budget friendly this pack is. I love making little self-care packages to hand out, and while I will buy and use masks in the $5-35 range, I prefer the $1-3 masks for the token give away (think: facial mask, hand cream, lip balm, etc.. tiny cheap self care packages). I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to. The more basic masks tend to be good for nearly everyone, and the resulting feeling is at least a fresh, hydrated face. So these are a repurchase for that purpose, as well as for my own use on days I want to keep it simple.<br /><br />I love that it has lots of moisture. The serum can be patted in all over face, neck, chest, even elbows & hands after.<br /><br />For all that it is, I give it 5 stars for this level of facial mask.\n",

Mine came with 1 defective slot, but... 1 from 168 doesn't make a difference to me, plus the fact that i bought it with a very good discount over listed price.<br />Overall and except for this slot its so pretty, sturdy construction, good quality, so i happily kept it.\n",
      "18324->No difference in my skin. I will use the jade in something else. | 2 | 0 | This Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller is beautiful. The roller doesn't appear to do anything for my facial skin. I love the jade that is why I gave it a two-star rating not because it worked for the skin.<br /><br />This set comes with a large almost heart-shaped piece of jade. There is a roller with three pieces of jade. I will be using this jade in something else.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Jopuzia Natural Jade Roller to family and friends.\n",
      "18353->After reading so many reviews on glitters.. | 2 | 0 | I have been trying to search Amazon for some nice glitter make up but it seems that most of these cheap brands do not deliver the quality. What you pay is what you get. I do highly recommend any girls who want super glitter eyelid makeup to look at the brand, CANMAKE - Jewelstar Eyes (8 colors avaliable).<br />Not sure if you have it in USA but try to look at online shops. IMO best glitter eyegel I have used. It's not sticky at all, last all day and super glittery and won't smudge nor drizzle all over your face. You won't regret trying CANMAKE Jewelstar Eyes.\n",
      "18371->Great Glosses! | 5 | 0 | Love these little glosses! Packaging so cute, and not at all \"gummy\". Feels like a more expensive product.<br />Actually perfect for sharing with my daughter who does not like a lot of color so I take those and she has the neutrals.\n",

      "18383->Good so far | 4 | 0 | I am one of those who prefer water flossers to string-based flossing. Process is much cleaner and, in my view, cleaning is more thorough.<br />This Chinese designed and made unit works well. You fill it with warm water, select the mode, possibly select a specific pick - but I always use the regular one - and you start flossing away.<br />Item design and ergonomics are generally Okay. However, the manual is not exactly helpful but most of us should be able to figure it out, eventually. Charging is via a custom USB cable but there is no actual charging unit so you need to find one such as your phone charger. You only need to charge it once every couple of weeks if you use it once daily.<br />Overall, a useful item and it does appear to be durable. Time will tell.\n",

      "18399->Nice subtle colors with a lovely shimmer to them. Good for day or night. | 4 | 0 | I'm not a huge makeup wearer, but I do like to put it on for special occasions. I really like this palette, they are bother neutral colors that I think would work with pretty much all skin tones. The colors are subtle, but show up well and are easy to use to highlight and contour around the eye. I really like the subtle shimmer--it makes what are normally pretty boring colors really pop.<br /><br />I also really like the adorable compact that the eyeshadow comes in. It's has a cute cat design. I mean, don't by this just for the cat compact if you don't like the colors, but the cat compact is a nice bonus.\n",
      "18402->Super easy to use….flap completely opens like a file folder instead of enclosed bag | 5 | 0 | So much easier than a cosmetics bag. Simply on snap and open the flap. All of your brushes are now laying there and easy to access!!<br /><br />The clear plastic should easily wipe up/clean overtime.  The trim is made of white which I suspect we’ll get dingy with make up with US. Would you prefer a different color to not sure wear.<br /><br />Great concept if you have a lot of cosmetic brushes and tools!\n",
      "18407->Worthless: Parts Fall Off While Shaving | 1 | 0 | Edit: The poor engineering issue has gotten worse. I'm now spending more time dealing with misaligned parts & literally parts that fall off during shaving. 0 Stars if I could.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />This is likely going to be the strangest review I've ever written.<br /><br />Out of the box, the Runwe gives a tremendous shave; possibly the best I've ever had from an Electric.<br /><br />One thing that is unique: They strongly suggest shaving before moisturizing (i.e. before showering) & to do so 100% dry.<br /><br />Then the problems begin (& seemingly never end).<br /><br />This unit is difficult to clean, & almost impossible to reassemble. I've done so twice. The first time took about 10 minutes to reassemble, the second time took over 25 minutes, & another 10-15 minutes the next day to fix the imperfections from the night before & I still don't have it 100% correct!<br /><br />The owner's manual is not helpful to say the least. It is very small & in numerous languages. The only actual (& usable) photographs are in the Russian section! There are miniature graphic gray boxes that convey the important information. Unfortunately, they are so small that they are unreadable even with a magnifying glass!<br /><br />I have found this unit (almost??) impossible to reassemble after cleaning (which it needs pretty frequently). I was hoping to continue using it until it becomes so dirty as to be worthless (I don't have time for the the 10-40 minute reassemble after cleaning).<br /><br />Another issue is it's difficult to close the unit correctly so it will work. If the lid is closed too softly, the unit doesn't run. Too hard, & it's very noisy. With each shave (I am used to opening the top of an electric after every shaving & blowing/shaking the hair out) it takes several minutes to get the unit working again.<br /><br />It's really a shame in that the Runwe gives a great shave, but is impossible to maintain. And this is being written at around 1 week of us. It's only going to get worse. I'd suggest they pull this product off the market, keep the great shaving heads & re engineer all removable parts & clamps.<br /><br />Made in China (surprise!!)\n",
      "18441->Super Gentle | 4 | 0 | My skin is really sensitive.<br /><br />I also don't generally like all-in-one products. You should see my bathroom cabinets. Trying to consolidate, but I get different rashes in different places, and no one thing works for everything.<br /><br />This is very gentle and did not make my skin or face or scalp break out or rash up at all. It's not super moisturizing, but it wasn't drying, either. The scent is very light, and the cleanser has a little minty/tingly kick. This would have worked for me in my teens or 20s when I couldn't wait to get out of the shower and on with my life.\n",
      "18469->only ONE is actually red/white/blue | 2 | 0 | of the 5, one is correct: the red/white stripes and then the dark blue w/ white stars.<br />of the rest: 2 of them are supposed to be red/white/blue but w/other designs. one is red w/a bunch of stars and the other has arrows but still red/white/blue to look like the flag.  the red is ORANGE. I put right next to the correct one and it is def ORANGE. so it in NO way would look like the \"America\" colors that would be used for 4th of July or other events as that was the point. the other two are supposed to be red/white stripes and then blue/white stripes, each w/a different combination. one has the blue on the bow, the other on the band. well, these are blue and LIGHT BLUE and NOT white at ALL.  so they are red/white stripe and blue and light blue stripe. again, not at all what would be appearing to be American flag colors. would not spend that money for just one so have to send back.  Am wondering if the blue/white ended up being light blue b/c the color bled into the white stripe next to it. if that's the case, then that means the color could in fact transfer to one's hair if it got wet too? or clothes.  yikes!\n",

      "18504->meh | 2 | 0 | They were indeed gentle - wish they were a little more substantial along the back area. Annoyingly difficult to keep a grip on them in the shower. (It felt a bit like trying to wash your face with a soapy slice of American cheese.)<br /><br />I found it much easier to use them at the sink to agitate cleanser without getting the back side wet. For me, they kinda work and kinda don't - I don't see myself using these every day, at any rate.\n",
      "18507->Let down | 3 | 0 | Debated on getting the light or darker color.  Ended up going with darker color and it was still way too light.<br />Doesn’t cover like the video shows it does.\n",
      "18531->Not a big fan | 3 | 0 | I ordered two trial sets from this company, one of here and one on their website, the one on the website coming with a free beard/hair wash as well.<br />I got three scents, Brewmaster, El Burrista and Royal Knight.<br />Besides Burrista the other two didn’t smell like what they were described as(fruity beer, and vanilla earl grey). The Burrista smelt really good though, just like coffee beans.<br /><br />This was my first time using beard oil/balm so was excited but after a few uses I feel underwhelmed.<br />The beard oil made me so so itchy that I had to wash it out.<br />The beard balm I didn’t feel added any softness at all.<br />The hog beard wash is definitely a winner however. Makes my beard pretty soft for a decent amount of time.<br /><br />I typically just put in tea tree leave in conditioner in my hair/beard which makes it soft all day, but figured I’d try something new. Just not a fan. Too messy to use the oil/balm, and I didn’t feel it didn’t anything.\n",

Standards 40 to 72 inch from floor which is 32 inches this mirror is only 30 inches.<br />Do kit buy this model for ada restroom!!!  Otherwise yes its a very nice heavy duty product.<br />Misleading description.\n",
      "18555->Nice Falsies! | 4 | 0 | So overall as far as false eyelashes go, these are pretty good.<br /><br />Magnetic lashes have become sort of a craze here in the last year or so, and I can see understandably why. The key however to applying them is to make sure you have a quality magnetic liner for application, and patience.<br /><br />I'm not huge on wearing false eyelashes or makeup on a regular basis, however for things such as family photos and an occasional date night out, it can be fun to get dressed up and feel a little \"extra\".<br /><br />The lashes themselves are really good quality, the liquid eyeliner goes on pretty well, but my only beef is that it can be sometimes difficult to get the magnet part to stick. But once it does, they look fairly natural.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend people to give these a try. They are priced well for having 6 pairs, can be reused, and the set contains everything you need to try them out. Overall, recommended.\n",
      "18579->Opening on shampoo and conditioner is too small. | 3 | 0 | I have my hair straightened and am pleased with the shampoo and conditioner except for one problem.<br />The opening on both is too small and it's difficult to squeeze out.  They need to redesign the cap.<br />Does anyone else have this problem?\n",

      "18638->Feels like it creates an extra step... | 3 | 0 | I tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...\n",

      "18661->Nice colors but not too comfy when talking | 3 | 0 | FCY (Blue Mars) neck gaiters nebula 4 pk<br /><br />The colors are very nice. The fabric edges are all finished. They fit very snug against the nose and mouth. The fabric is thin. Coupled with the very snug fit, the outline of your nose and mouth is going to be very visible. Because of the snug fit, talking while wearing this gaiter isn't comfortable.<br /><br />I got these to provide some blocking against the cold and cold wind. Just as with other gaiters, these aren't meant to  filter out very tiny particles like viruses.\n",
      "18665->Nice add ons | 5 | 0 | I didn't even get to use the brush, just got it, but I was taken by the hemp pouch it came with, 4 extra bristles (in case they ever fall out? Doesn't look like they would) and some interesting looking device that probably is used to get the hair from the brush.<br /><br />Everything was packaged with such class.\n",
      "18675->Not for me | 3 | 0 | This thing is very frustrating for me. After tey8ng for a loooong time to get it to work, I finally figured it out. I unfortunately didn't like the process, feel or the results. It feels like it's grabbing my skin and it just doesn't seem to be consistent. Others wsy like it, but I don't  :/<br /><br />My thoughts and criteria for products I review: (Amazon’s Rating Criteria in Parentheses)<br />' 1 star (I hate it!): Feel it's a waste of money. Will never use it again. Would never recommend. Not safe to use. Either throw away or return it.<br />' '2 star (I don’t like it): Don't like it and wouldn't use it again, but may still have at least 1 positive thing about it.<br />' ' ' 3 star (It’s ok): Product has both positives and negatives, and I may or may not continue using it. Someone else may like it more and is potentially still worth purchasing.<br />' ' ' ' 4 star (I like it): Item as described in functionality, purpose and quality. May have 1 or 2 things I don't care for or would change, but not big issues. Would recommend if asked, but wouldn't say I love it.<br />' ' ' ' ' 5 star (I love it!): Practically perfect. Nothing lacking in functionality or quality.

      "18701->Brush has Homemade Look and Quality | 3 | 0 | I was attracted to this beard brush because of its size and shape. I have a relatively short beard and needed something small. The brush is palm-sized and the bristles are medium short.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, though, the wood is curiously out-of-round which gives the brush a “homemade” look. It could indeed be the product of a cottage industry business in China where the wood blanks are cut by hand, I don’t know. Another thing that was odd was that an inventory sticker was placed over the logo of the brush and leaves a sticky residue when it’s removed. And finally, this brush still drops bristles in the sink when I use it.<br /><br />Solid 3 stars, only recommended if you can live with the above idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "18712->Nice Cleanser That Leaves No Oily Residue, But Is Surprisingly Drying For My Skin | 4 | 0 | This Neutrogena cleansing oil is nice and does a thorough job cleaning my face. The oil is initially applied with dry hands on your dry face, but you add water to your skin and that emulsifies the oil and makes it look and feel pretty much like soap. This cleanser leaves no residual oil on my face at all.  In fact, it actually leaves my face a little dry as compared to my usual cleanser.  Also, while it removes most of my mascara, I still need to use my Lancôme eye makeup remover to get rid of the last traces of non-waterproof mascara under my eyes.<br /><br />This cleansing oil comes in a nice bottle with a pump that works well. It doesn't cause me any rash or irritation. This does have fragrance, but even though I can get headaches or allergic reactions to fragrance this one doesn't bother me. I think this is a nice cleansing oil that will work well for most skin types- except I wouldn't really recommend it if you have dry skin like me. And just keep in mind you may still need eye makeup remover. It's a nice product, except my skin is too dry to use it regularly.  But it may be perfect for others. I give it 3.5 stars.\n",
      "18739->Scent Is Not For Me | 3 | 0 | Oof! I just can't get over the smell of this one. It could be a scent that others may find pleasurable, but not me. I can't find a specific smell it reminds me of...but think a deep nutty smell mixed with the smell of old leather? The scent dissipates a bit after you rub it into your skin, but it lingers just enough to bother me. But if you are a fan of those deep, woodsy, older scents, this might be for you.<br /><br />I will say, it soaks extremely well into the skin, leaving you with a really nice matte finish that most other oils aren't capable of.\n",

      "18748->LARGE! | 4 | 0 | This is BIG!!!  Way too big for what I needed.  Nice vinyl to clean....Just wish it were smaller.<br />Price is average, delivery quick.\n",
      "18768->Won't buy again | 2 | 0 | Why did I buy this? I mean I got sucked in by this instagram / youtube hype over color correction. But it really doesn't work on me and the red is not for pale skin like me cause my foundation couldn't cover it up. It is one of those things that will sit in my bin till expiration...<br />The only reason I gave it a 2 star instead of one is the beauty sponge is good. I see it as me buying the sponge and got the 3 color correctors for free.\n",

      "18839->Skin and Schnoz are at Odds | 3 | 0 | Heavily perfumed and upon first use it stung.  As I became accustomed to it the smell was no longer overpowering and the sting went away.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing, though.  Acclimating to a house smelling of cigarette smoke, for instance, does not negate the presence of the odor, it merely lessens the awareness.<br /><br />I used it for 3 weeks and did notice my skin appreciating the oil; however, I am opting to stick with my Olay products.  I can't get past the strong scent and what this product might contain to warrant such a potent aroma being acceptable.  What does it smell like Without the additional scent?\n",
      "18864->WHY DIDN'T I GET THIS SOONER?! | 5 | 0 | Oh my GAWWWD! This thing is amazing! This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. \"bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?\".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with💖<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450°) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!❣💞🥰💇‍♀️\n",
      "18868->Awesome | 5 | 0 | Review for: 100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub<br /><br />I love body scrubs and I love when they have an oil base that that helps to fight winter dryness. This one has a wonderful oil base that coats my skin and really hydrates it. It also smells fantastic. Because this is oil based, it does leave any oily film on my shower floor. I deal with this by turning my hot water all the way up and then rinsing the floor really well before getting out of the shower.\n",
      "18894->Not The Worst...Not The Best | 3 | 0 | These are okay. They are definitely not heavy duty enough if you wear a lot of makeup. I occasionally throw on a little concealer or foundation before remote meetings on ZOOM, so these wipes work for me. However it still takes me about 4 wipes to get that small amount of makeup off.<br /><br />I don't mind the scent, but I don't love it either.<br />Overall, I wouldn't brag about these wipes or go out of my way to recommend them, they're just okay.\n",
      "18906->Good for home use | 3 | 0 | These are nice and sharp, and fit in the hand with a decent tension.<br />However the nippers tips or cutting blades are of a soft metal. So they bend out of shape easily. So if you happen to drop these from more than a 4inch height, they will likely end up wonky or bent.<br />So they are good for u9e use,\n",

It used to be light and easy to come out the bottle. Now, its as thick as greek yogurt and it need to hit so so hard constantly to get something out. Why o why?

      "18930->eyes are very itchy at the end of the day | 3 | 0 | I love everything about this mascara EXCEPT my eyes are very itchy at the end of the day after I remove my makeup.....  I can only think this is the cause as I've not tried anything different.  I had hoped because it is organic that the allergic reactions would be minimized.....<br />Hate it that I won't be able to use it....\n",
      "18936->Beautiful gift, relaxing tool | 5 | 0 | I absolutely loved the jade roller and the scraping tool! It feels very gentle on your face and your neck, and there are instructions inside the box on how to use the rose quartz roller, with video links and care instructions for the natural rose quartz (it says jade, but this is rose quartz).<br />I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some conflicting information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the bottom part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll downward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a great massaging, relaxing, and skin care tool that looks beautiful.\n",

      "18982->Awful smell | 1 | 0 | Do you know that smell when you pass by a hotel or similar place when they do laundry? That offensive chemical smell that you can’t really get rid of? That’s exactly how this smells. Cheap laundry detergent that stays on your everything for hours.<br />I would tolerate it if it were as good and as effective as I hoped - but alas, not everything works. I used it on my feet, 3 times in hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’s somewhat good. Nope. There us a little piling when you massage the liquid in, but the skin does not seem, feel, or look any different afterwards. Plus, the smell.<br /><br />I’ll take o’keefe, babyfeet, and mechanical exfoliation 100% of time over this.\n",
      "19005->Beautiful colors, might not work with all base coats. | 4 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:19bb6cb5b35b75de6cd429e3da29e779]] These gel polishes are gorgeous colors! I found things I liked and disliked about them.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />1. The kit comes in a pack of 10 and the color variety is good. This is a lot of polishes for the price.<br />2. The colors look the same wet and dry *see video* as well as on the bottle swatch.<br />3. They have lasted very well for me and I work with my hands a lot as well as play guitar often with no pick. This will chip your nails quickly, but this hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />1. This kit does not come with a base or top coat.<br />2. I already have a few base and top coats hanging around the house and the first attempt I made using this polish I used a base and top coat that was not comparable. It would not dry even when under the UV light for quite some time. The second attempt I switched my base and top coat to another brand and it worked. They should really just include the base and top coats if this is a potential for customers. Just keep this in mind if you find the polish isn't drying the first attempt.<br /><br />Given the pros and cons as long as you can find a compatible base and top coat you'll really like this product, if you want to avoid the frustration I'd suggest finding a kit that includes the base and top coats already.\n",
      "19026->Realistic scalp | 5 | 0 | I love the chocolate and chestnut colors of this silky wig.<br />When you first remove it from the netting, there's a lot of static so you do need to spray it down before wearing it. It's one of the better scalps on wigs of this price range, as you can see in the photograph. Not as fake looking as most.<br />In my opinion it's a very good wig for the money.\n",
      "19032->Deep color & fast drying but chips | 3 | 0 | 3.9 stars<br /><br />1. This is MUCH darker than expected (tho I happen to like it). One coat will give you a purple look but more than that, this gets dark enough to look purple-black.<br />2. This dries super fast - which is a big deal to me - and that's nice until you start getting to the end of the jar. Once this gets down to the last part of the jar and begins to get tackier, it's hard to get a smooth coat on. Adding any kind of thinner makes the polish effect dull and ugly.<br />3. This is kind of a small jar or the price.<br />4. This looks really nice and smooth when the bottle is new but the polish chips easily with more than 1 coat.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good polish if you want something of a darker color, but it doesn't last very long.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that I want to buy some more of this color - even though I think the price is too high.\n",

      "19042->Great colours | 4 | 0 | The best thing about this wig is the colours: fantastic fantasy cosplay colours: it's just beautiful. The 'hair' is soft and not too shiny. Too shiny would really spoil this IMO.<br />The hair is REALLY full, so it's going to either look The Shining scary, or else, you are going to need a crown or something to keep the hair off your face. You can also style it off your face too.<br />The hair is cut in a long shag style, with some bits in the back much shorter. This gives it the full look. The hairline section is the wig's weak point and it looks fake--well it looks fake anyway with the colours, but it's hard to make the wig look GOOD. Again back to styling, crown, or some type of headband to smooth over the hairline section.\n",

      "19087->Breaks fairly easy but you can plenty of them | 4 | 0 | I for these to use for the ends of my side ponytail. When I use my regular bands. They are just too big and bulky and they tangle  up.<br /><br />So good thing about these are:<br />- they do not tangle my hair<br />- they stretch a bit but not too much<br />- they give you a ton of them so you don’t feel bad losing them<br /><br />Con:<br />- they break fairly easy\n",
      "19095->A lot of hair | 4 | 0 | I will preface this by saying I own only three wigs (two lace front, one not.  All three are cheaper and synthetic hair) and I am in no way an expert.  I’m still learning how to style them, etc.<br /><br />That said, of the three, this is my second favorite.  It is a lot of hair.  As someone with thin, fine hair that has been kept short for years, I think it may be almost too much hair for me.  I may have to trim it some so that it won’t feel so overpowering.  The hair itself looks decent enough that it could probably be  a daily wig for most.\n",
      "19100->files aren't 10/10 but the nail buffs are! | 4 | 0 | The grit isn't very strong on the nail rectabgle buffs and files, but on the buffers with all the different sides it's really strong and really good, just harder to file short nails with. That said, it was still able to file down acrylic nails it just took a little longer.<br /><br />But I really like the buffer files with the different sides, my damaged nail from acrylics was easy to smooth down to paint over it. The brushes are nice and do their job well as well. And it comes with plenty so I know it will be awhile before I run out!\n",

It smells very floral and light. It feels good, I use this in my skincare routine before a moisturizer, after I get out of the shower. It feels okay on my skin, whenever you dispense some product out- it appears some of the flowers come out and they do not dissolve very well or rub into the skin. They come out in small flakes. That’s the only downside of this I would say. I did use this on a dry patch of skin I had, and it recovered within 3-4 days. I would buy this again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Panthenol, Propanediol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG/PPG-20/6 Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzotriazolyl Dodecyl P-Cresol, Sodium Phytate, Parfum (Fragrance), Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol, Propylene Glycol, Dendrobium Nobile Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 73360 (Red 30 Lake).\n",
      "19120->TRY THIS! test on FACE for match not hands, evens out skin tone, not for dry skin | 4 | 0 | I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

      "19150->Update | 1 | 0 | Update: Unless you're only going to wear it once, it's not worth the little bit of money! It's heavy, it unravels, tangles and frizzes terribly. The curly pieces came straight to wavy and wouldn't curl for anything and tangled & matted horribly (removed it after one day). So disappointed!<br />You can't beat this deal and so far I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm only giving 3 stars right now because I haven't installed it yet. I forgot to take pictures before soaking in vinegar/water mix. The hair was nicely packaged in 6 plastic bags each having their own smaller bag of the wet & wavy pieces. There was no smell, no bugs, and the locs appear well made and natural looking; not dull, but not that shiny synthetic look either. The color is great and a true T30 blend. I noticed that even though the locs are twisted all the way down into a nice curl, some of them had little dingle berry knots hanging on. I'll have to cut those off before installation to prevent any frizzy knot issues during the process. I'll come back in a couple of weeks to update this review and post pictures.\n",

      "19158->This is nice oil. Works very well as a beard oil. | 5 | 0 | I have a big fluffy beard. Unfortunately in the winter, it more resembles a brillo pad in texture and I sometimes look like a homeless person.<br /><br />This oil works well to condition and treat your beard, and the skin underneath. I apply it right out of the shower after towel drying my beard while it is still damp. I use three squirts of oil, placed in my palm, run my hands together and massage into my beard. It keeps my beard soft and supple all day, and treats the skin underneath to stop dryness and itching.<br /><br />I almost thought of trimming my magnificent beard down because it was so rough, and it was itchy, this is allowing me to continue to grow it.<br /><br />My beard hair is soft, manageable, and free of knots.<br /><br />The glass bottle is heavy duty, so you can take it when you travel.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the cost. It's pretty expensive, but I think a bottle would last you 2 months or so, but it's still a pretty hefty price to pay for a soft and manageable beard, free of itchiness.\n",
      "19166->Really good stuff! | 5 | 0 | This body scrub is really nice.  It smells so good and it smooths the and nourishes the skin perfectly. When you rub this gently onto your skin then rinse it off you can instantly feel the difference. It feels as if all the dead skin has been removed and your pores have been opened. It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price. It's definitely worth giving a try if you are interested and able to. It's really good. I love it.\n",
      "19167->Stunning overall | 4 | 0 | This tiara is stunning. Even though it’s for play/dress up it’s very attractive. The tiara is mainly a rose gold color on the metal. It has fine detail around the headband of the tiara. Each delicate flower is antique looking. The metal is darkened in areas. The gemstones in the leaves are a light pink/purple color. The other gemstones are other various shades of purple. There’s a deep purple that is almost red and a purple that’s in the middle of the light and dark. The tiara is substantial. It’s not sharp despite looking like it has many sharp pieces to it. I will say a few of the rhinestones that set up on top of the metal decoration were bent. I was able to bend them back ever so slightly. Of course I worry too much bending may break the tiara.<br /><br />It fits well on the head and it is quite comfortable. It’s a attractive tiara and definitely one that’s more for an adult or teen head. I wouldn’t consider something like this for a child. It’s definitely larger for a larger head.\n",

I usually use the long scrubbers because of this reason. But the gloves did do what they said. I enjoyed my bath tonight with these scrubbers but i felt kind of like a cleaning lady. Maybe if it was easier to put on (maybe like a single band to simply put hand through) instead of a glove i would give it 5 stars. But i liked it. Will continue to use it out until it wears out!\n",

My skin was bumpy, irritated, and had lots of blackheads. I tried all the face washes and cleansers and they didn't do much. So I tried the Radha Beauty Dead Sea Mud Musk. I was very impressed! I left it on for about 7 minutes. It gives a nice minty tingle the whole time. If it starts to itch, you've left it on too long, get it off! I put a wet, hot cloth on my face for a moment to loosen it a bit, then just wipe it off, bit by bit.<br />My skin was SO SMOOTH, clear, and nice looking! I actually got compliments! I use it once to twice a week, but no more than twice. It really, really helps the look of my skin.<br />I was very skeptical but now I'm a convert!\n",
      "19311->Good for Nail Art | 5 | 0 | &quot;Jeff's Wife&quot; - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.\n",

That was my first Epson Salt experience. Since then, I've become convinced that you can't have enough Epsom Salt at home if you have members of your family with dry or itchy skin (my husband).<br /><br />I prefer the one that comes with lavender because it's more relaxing, magnesium is always good and is a natural muscle relaxant that helps our sleep. Best use: warm bath before going to bed. Also does the trick with growing pains (sometimes they can disturb their sleep).\n",

Kids aren't expected to gentle on things so I didn't figure they would last terribly long but given they are designed for children, at least the lenght of wear they get out of dollar store sunglasses would be appreciated. Our experience with these glasses was a few days, or less, for both pairs.<br /><br />These are adorable. If you have a very careful and gentle little one or need a constume type accessory, this is a good bet. Otherwise avoid.\n",
      "19414->Cute and functional, but velvet coating makes operation rough | 3 | 0 | You can tell that they were closed tightly when they were coated in the velvet, because they are difficult to initially open and once they are, there are non coated portions visible.  One was also received a little roughed up, and they appear to have been this way prior to packaging (none of the velvet was in the bag and the bag had no scratches or damage).  Having said that, these do work well to hold your hair and they're very cute.  Once you pry them open the first time they're much easier to open and close on subsequent uses.<br /><br />They fit a small bun or a large ponytail and they don't move much.  Even  with the damaged one (which was the least fun color), it's still a good purchase and they'll match virtually anything.\n",

The item is not intended for picking up hair, but for removing loose hair from your pet so why ask about picking up hair?  The sucking power depends on your vacuum so why ask?<br /><br />Now to the item itself.  It appears to be well make although it is difficult to use due to the fact hat there is no trigger to alloy you to extend the bristles in place while using the brush.  I would give it a much higher rating if it had that feature and would use it far more often.  As is, it is somewhat usable, but cumbersome at best.\n",

      "19443->And okay product that works some of the time | 4 | 0 | My optimitrist recommended these for my dry eye problem. They are for wiping away crusted on particles or dried oils from your eyelids.<br />The only problem is that sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. If the stuff has just been crusted on or is moist, then these will usually do the job. But if you have dried oils in your duct area, not only will these NOT clean that out, but will cause the dried bits to scrape around on your eye, irritating it more.<br />Use judiciously and keep your expectations low.<br />Will only purchase again if the price is low enough and there isn't another product out there.\n",

      "19458->Okay purchase-challenge is with thinner strap bra | 4 | 0 | This is a nice purchase for those of us who don't care for super low tops and blouses, but at the same time don't always want to wear a tank or another shirt underneath what you're already wearing (that can make it really hot on a warm day!). It looks really nice with whatever top I've had to wear it for...whether I was going fancy or just casual it went perfectly with out looking weird.<br /><br />I like the colors in this pack: white, tan and black. Works for most of what my wardrobe needs are.<br /><br />I will say that the snaps could be improved upon.  While I have no problems when wearing a bra with thicker straps, I can't wear the Cami with a thinner strapped bra-the Cami doesn't stay in place as well.  And since I'm a small person, it slips so low I might as well not wear it. I'm thinking it needs at least one more snap to help keep it in place-if your a crafts/sewing person you could just add it and have no problem.<br /><br />Overall, the Cami meets my need and I look forward to getting some other colors.\n",
      "19465->Very rich and moisturizing - thick cream | 4 | 0 | This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.\n",
      "19474->No more \"bed head.\" | 4 | 0 | Happy that wearing these satin night caps keeps my hair from flattening down to \"bed head.\"<br />The surrounding band is too wide so I must fold it. I don't like it on my forehead.\n",
      "19487->Wife likes it- if the wife is happy- I am happy!! | 5 | 0 | I bought these for my wife who is always putting argan oil in her hair because she says it helps to moisturize it and keep it healthy.  She was pleasantly surprised when these showed up. (I don't know if it was because she liked the product, or the fact that I listen to her occasionally) j/k. She loves them both and her hair is much more manageable and softer.  Personally I am an old fashioned head and shoulders guy myself, but I think that it is just a guy guy thing.  She has at least 4 different sets of shampoo that she rotates.  I'll probably get in trouble when she reads this, but I only write it as I see it.  As far as I can tell, she is very happy with this product.<br />If you found this review helpful in any way, please take a moment to hit the button.<br />Thank You.\n",
      "19497->Not human hair | 1 | 0 | Company, I am so very disappointed. I am in an event tomorrow and as I was adding the hair in, I noticed that it was synthetic hair. I was so very angry and disappointed with this product. I had to leave it in for the event. Why would you advertise human hair when you are aware that it’s synthetic or a blend. It’s not fair to the customer. I will never purchase anything from tour company.<br /><br />Taylor\n",
      "19502->Poor salesmanship - average product | 2 | 0 | Like several others, I hit the \"order\" button on the free two week trial without reading the fine print. I did read it immediately thereafter however, so was aware of the automatic enrollment in Dermitage's monthly renewal subscription. I received the trial product on Tuesday, Feb. 15. I called Dermitage on Friday, Feb. 25 to let them know I was not interested in the subscription. They said, \"too late!\" My two week trial was already up and I had  been billed the previous day for the first month. Of course, I cancelled immediately and they will not have any of my business in the future. As best as I can tell this is a scam to trap people into a single purchase. I doubt they get many repeat customers.<br /><br />The cream feels refreshing on my skin, but after 10 days I cannot see any improvement to my skin tone or texture. I have very few wrinkles, just some fine lines around my eys and mouth. They look the same. The instant lifting creme doesn't appear to do anything except clog my pores. I have not had a breakout in over 10 years (I am in my 50's) and one or the other of these products did cause my face to break out.\n",

      "19569->Tolerable quality USB Hub Mouse Bungee | 3 | 0 | While the product is exactly as advertised, there are a few \"quirks\" that are not obvious from the descriptions:<br /><br />1) This is NOT a powered hub. You don't plug in a power supply to it. So it is not really a \"charging station\". Indeed, if you plug in a modern smartphone, it will probably tell you that it will not charge on a \"low-powered hub\".<br /><br />2) The \"bungee\" tower will likely fall off as it's only held in there via friction<br /><br />3) The central LED changes color in a cycle, and you have ZERO control over it.<br /><br />4) The USB ports on the sides are UPSIDE DOWN, at least in my version. I had to turn the USB cable over to plug them in. I am not sure whether this is an assembly error or are they designed this way.<br /><br />With all that said, yes, it is a mouse bungee (albeit a VERY mediocre one), and it is a USB3 hub (albeit, a very mediocre one). Thus, a mediocre 3/5 star rating.\n",
      "19627->My Daughter Loves Them | 4 | 0 | She wears them all day long without a complaint.<br />However, I put one on and those teeth really started to bother my head!  Amazingly, they FIT my head.<br /><br />I guess if my kid isn't bothered, I shouldn't complain but I'm shocked with how bothersome the teeth were.<br /><br />Yes yes, I'm an adult but I have a small head and my toddler has a big head.  Still.  I wear a lot of headbands.  Scarves.  Braids in my hair.  Clips.  Barrettes.  It takes a lot to bother me and these headbands did.\n",
      "19629->Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐ | 5 | 0 | I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!\n",
      "19652->Cute but just ok | 3 | 0 | Cute packaging - they look like two giant pills lol. I’ve used both every day for about two weeks and see no difference in my lips besides them maybe not being as peely…<br />FULL- The full tube is the one that’s supposed to plump up your lips. It’s tingly but not painful. Not as thick as regular gloss and lasts about 2 hours if you’re not putting your lips on anything. The tingling sensation lasts for about an hour or so.<br />CARE- The care tube is the actual gloss you put on afterwards. Lasts a decent amount of time but it’s not great.\n",

      "19720->WOW! YES, BUY! | 4 | 0 | I was pleasantly surprised by this hair, mainly by how the passion twists came out. Passion twists are my favorite protective hairstyle OF ALL TIME! So i do my hair this way every few months and have used a lot of different types of hair brands/length/curl pattern. Some good, some bad. This is my first ombre style and I LOVE IT! (I got ombre before but cut the ends off) I got the 8 inch and they stretched out to be the perfect length for me (ends at bra length). The hair is easy to twist and very lightweight on my head. The only issue i have is the amount of shedding i had while twisting (i provided an image). I did not cut, rip, stretch or overly manipulate the hair to cause it to shed it just naturally shedded as if the pieces of hair were already cut and just hanging on to the curl.<br /><br />To get the look i have in the images i used all 4 packs and every single curl on my head. On the whole back of my head i doubled the twists (using 2 strands per twist) and in the front i used a single strand per twist. The boxes are medium size but i do have a larger head and a lot of hair...it's not heavy at all. So far i have gotten a lot of compliments at work! :)  9/10 only because of the shedding. Highly recommend.\n",

      "19732->Not a very good product. | 2 | 0 | The only reason why I continue to use this product is because it's the only hot pink dye that is both affordable and convenient (you could purchase it at Walgreen's). Other than that, it's terrible. I have naturally black hair and the instructions said that the bleach will turn my hair the accurate color in 1-2 hours. However, it took 5 hours to bleach a small strip of my hair to dye hot pink. 5 hours! And it still didn't bleach all the way. The product itself is horrible. Instructions state that if you leave the dye in for 30 minutes, your hair will remain vibrant pink for 4 months. However, this product washes out of my hair with every shampooing, leaving my pink highlight a nasty, neon orange color. You literally have to reapply the dye and complete the entire dying process over again after every wash. It's so time consuming and such a hassle. Though I know it's harming my hair, I resorted to combing the dye through onto my highlight and then straightening it with a flat iron to dry.<br /><br />Will not be purchasing this product again and will definitely be looking for a new one. I've finally come to my senses and realized that $9.99 could be put to much better use.\n",
      "19733->Nice compact size, but too little witch hazel to be of significant benefit | 3 | 0 | This are mini wipes, with each measuring about 5.25 by 4.25 inches. They are packaged very compactly, making them easy to take along in a gym bag, backpack or even in your pocket. The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a \"prep\" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best. It's not something I'd get again.\n",
      "19737->Overprized and missing brush cleaner | 2 | 0 | This is a decent makeup brush set. Would I pay $40 for this, NEVER. First the bag is very nice. The 4 brushes that come with it are also very nice, but are they basically worth $10 a brush, no. For that kind of money you are better of buying a Sigma brush. I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well. None of these are outstanding and any better than you can find in the beginner sets you can get for like $10 to $20 depending on the set size. So getting the bag and supposed brush cleaner that I did not get does not warrent the $40 in my eyes.\n",
      "19751->Cheap quality...squeaky | 1 | 0 | Based on my experience with other rollers, this one is pretty cheaply made and I feel certain it won't last long.  I am almost scared to use it very often because I am afraid it will break.<br /><br />Updated to say, that after approx 5 uses, it is very squeaky.  I assumed this would be the case.  AVOID this one.  There are better ones out there.\n",

      "19770->I love this iron but it does not come with gloves as specified | 3 | 0 | This flat iron comes with two strange looking hair clips and a carry pouch. However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done. <br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the \"blades\" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of $25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this. The Amazon site says \"DUAL VOLTAGE AND COMPLETE ACCESSORIES ..... Equipped with 1x storage bag, 2x hair clips, and 1x Gloves.\" Well it was missing the last item. Had it come with the gloves, I would have rated this 4 stars.\n",
      "19808->Pretty Set, One Brush Frayed After First Use, The Rest Are Holding Up Well | 4 | 0 | I ordered this in the #6 set to use for watercolors. I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br /><br />This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br /><br />Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br /><br />The overall look of the brushes is very nice. I love all things girly & nail brushes rarely fail me in the girly options that are floating around on amazon.<br /><br />So far my absolute favorite nail brush (that I use for watercolor) is a 100% Kolinsky Sable Round Nail Brush.

      "19827->Great for almost everything, except ears | 4 | 0 | The cotton on these swabs is layered thinner and firmer than other cotton swabs I've tried. This makes them less than ideal for cleaning delicate parts of the human body, like ears.<br /><br />However, they are excellent for everything else. If you're doing detail cleaning, these swabs are a total bargain. If you need cotton swabs for a high heat situation (where plastic just won't do), these are more than adequate. If you want cheap swabs for children's arts and crafts, stop looking now.<br /><br />When it comes to cleaning out my ears, I'll stick to the name brand that I've known and trusted my whole life. But for every other situation I need cotton swabs in, from here on out, I'll be saving some money by using these bargain swabs.\n",
      "19832->Beautiful Bottle, May Use This as a Hand Soap | 4 | 0 | I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, \"White Musk\" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I had to do it again, I'd choose a different scent. But if you're a white musk fan, go for it!\n",

Great Hair! | 5 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:960b84058924153a7db27c4cc6448444]] I received three bundles from the company to install and wear (18\"/20\"/22\" straight hair weave bundles). The bundles arrived earlier than expected and I was pleased with the quality of the hair. I even got a nice pair of lashes with the hair.<br /><br />The hair itself was soft and the texture was nice and full. My stylist also said that she liked the hair as well and that the hair was soft and very pretty! I chose the quick weave method this time during my installation instead of sew-in. Women do however think it's my own hair because how well my stylist lays the tracks so close to each other. It's light and not heavy and looks quite natural!<br /><br />I've purchased several hair bundles from this company over the past years and the quality of hair I've received has been pretty consistent. The hair looks so natural and the compliments I receive when I use this hair are endless!<br />Try the hair yourself; the bundles are a great price in comparison to other companies and you'll look great wearing them!\n",

I absolutely could not have worn this without some work.<br /><br />I watched a few tutorials and managed to fix the bangs. After that, I got tons of compliments! It's super full and vibrant. I'll probably try running it through some fabric softener next time to get some shine out of it.<br /><br />It stayed on nicely when pinned to a wig cap (the one is came with was RIDICULOUSLY right, btw, so get your own.)\n",
      "19878->Love the all natural ingredients | 5 | 0 | We live in Florida so I am always looking for good sunscreen for my 3 kids.  Since I have a 9 month old, 2 year old and 5 year old, I need something that is soft on their skin and prefer natural ingredients if possible.<br /><br />This sunscreen is 100% natural and uses grape seed oil, sunflower oil, honey and sea salt so I thought I would give it a try.  So far I like it.  This sunscreen is a little thicker than some and tends to be a little bit more oily (I think this is due to some of the natural ingredients used).  Once the sunscreen is absorbed, however, some of the oil dissipates.  The only thing I would change is maybe to give it a little bit of a scent.  As it is now it has strange smell, as such I only use on their body (I think it would be a little overpowering on the face).<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.  If you did I would LOVE it if you would click yes below!\n",
      "19892->Way Too Small! | 2 | 0 | I have worn this type of scarf on my hair off and on for a very long time. These are made to fit a child, not an adult.

      "19896->Nice set, however | 3 | 0 | This is really cute set. I love the jeweled headband and earrings. However, I did not recieve the purple butterfly headband. I was really disappointed in this as that's what I was looking forward to the most. I recieved the butterfly headband from the colorful set. This is ok, but not what I was supposed to get.<br />So purchase at the risk of not getting what you're supposed to.\n",
      "19908->Nice but not worth the price | 3 | 0 | I have thick naturally curly hair that when I put up always knots at the top and I was hoping this would allow me to brush my hair quicker. I am not entirely satisfied with the results compared to the price charged for this.<br /><br />First I had a lot of issues with this brush making it all the way through my long thick hair, leaving the knots at the top and underneath my head. I ended up having to use my old hard bristle brush to get some of the knots out and finishing up by using this brush.<br /><br />Second this brush does have quite of bit of weight to it and I found the handle start digging into my hand and causing some pain when I was trying to work through some knots in my hair.<br /><br />That being said I was happy with the results, in my pictures the left size of my head was brushed with my old brush and the right side with this brush and I could see a visible different in the amount of frizzing my hair was doing, especially at the top.<br /><br />Where I was super impressed with this brush was in the softness of my hair after using it, I could not believe the difference in the way my hair felt compared to a traditional brush. SO I will be using this more of a finishing brush rather than an everyday brush.<br /><br />Overall if you have thick curly hair I would not recommend this as the results I received weren't in line with the cost associated with this brush.\n",
      "19916->Not so Starry | 3 | 0 | Thank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set – I had to get it.<br /><br />I don’t know about others’ experiences – mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little “gel pots”. I remembered what my nail techs used to use – small make-up brushes – and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments – I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn’t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not too unhappy with it. It’s not something I would likely purchase again.\n",
      "19927->Good sized wipes | 3 | 0 | I got these to cleanse my face in the evenings before bed. I am midway through the first package, and they are a nice size, stay moist and very soft. I do not like that they are scented though, one because it iritates my nose a bit, and two, becasue I do not like extra cehmicals (scents) to use on my face.<br />Otherwise they are quite nice and a good buy.\n",
      "19944->Pores sucked up product, left lil dots lol | 1 | 0 | I heard great things about this. Unfortunately I'm not a fan. Fare amount of product if all you need it for are eyebrows. ( Don't waste, empty all capsuled powder into a glass bowl and take what you need )<br />Slight tiny burn sensation if left on for more than recommended time. Longer it's on, darker it gets. Product sank into my pores and you could clearly see tiny dark brown spots everywhere lol As long as you DON'T wash your eyebrows I see this lasting a week, otherwise 2-4days depending also how oily your skin is. I reccomend getting a different tiny brush, the one it comes with is a lil too thick. For mess free application use oil, lotion or aquaphor to outline brows first.\n",
      "19961->Does its job, until it comes off. Not good. | 3 | 0 | Just installed this screen protector. Went on pretty easily. Two days later I dropped my phone and completely shattered the protector.  However, while it DID do it's job, it DID fall off on impact. Not good.<br /><br />The next day I installed the second protector and it's been lifting off and not staying secured to the screen. This is definitely a problem with this brand of screen protectors. They will not stay on so proceed with caution.\n",
      "19971->Very Intense Fragrance – Not For Everyone | 3 | 0 | The description for the Perris Monte Carlo Cacao Azteque is very exotic and my expectation was through the roof. However, it was disappointing for me. The fragrance is very intense and for the first few minutes all I got was burnt cedar notes. After about 10 minutes, I could make out some cocoa, chili pepper and cardamom but the cedar was the most dominant. I am not sure what Xocoatl smells like, but I assume the burnt carbon-ish note might have something to do with it.<br /><br />To summarize, strong, intense fragrance with overpowering burnt cedar notes with cocoa, chili pepper and cardamom.<br /><br />Hopefully, the intensity and notes appeals to others.\n",
      "19972->Love it | 5 | 0 | I have a similar diffuser but the cover is plastic, this one is ceramic and it feels and looks so much nicer!<br />I have another diffuser in bed room and love it so much,  wanted to get another one for kitchen.<br /><br />Ultrasonic aroma diffuser is so much better than candle and  room spray in my opinion.<br />I don't like candle makes fuse and burning smell afterward.<br />Room spray is overpowering smell at first and  doesn't last too long.<br />On the other hand, diffuser doesn't make fuse,burning smell and smells evenly from begging to end.<br />This is 100ml size and you think it's small and for only bed room but we live in 2600+ sqft , oepn floor house and when I use this in kitchen, I can still smell in my living room! (I think our ceiling fan help as well.)<br />This is really great addition for bedroom, living room or entryway!<br />Lighting is therapeutic at night too!<br />Totally recommend!!\n",

      "19987->Smooth fast shave, easy to use. | 5 | 0 | I have used Norelco travel razors for years, about one per year. My recent attempt to reorder was met with double the price, for the same razor. So, I ordered this one instead. About the same price as before, but with 3 blades instead of 2.<br /> I've used it three days so far and I think it's wonderful. Shaves very close, doesn't pull,  easy to clean, and i love the battery status indicator. As I said I've used it 3 days, the battery has used very little charge. I'm anticipating being able to go aweek or two between charges. I'm happy with this one, at least so far.<br /><br />OK, one whole week. I've used this razor each day for 7 days....still think it's great. It's easy to clean, quiet (enough), comfortable to hold and use. I'm getting a close smooth shave, and have only used about half the charge. The charge was a concern, because I wanted to be able to travel for at least a week before having to worry about charging. Thumbs up for this razor.\n",

      "20009->Black only | 3 | 0 | Pay attention to color. I wanted the red/black and selected that image on the left assuming it would one I received. It does not change the color in the item color so you will receive black. So I have a stop pad to give away.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the product just not what I wanted.\n",
      "20011->Smell is too strong for me | 2 | 0 | I tried a moisturizer by The Saem previously, but couldn't keep it on for more than ten minutes because of the strong scent. Unfortunately, this lip balm has that same scent, directly under my nose, and it lingers on drinking glasses too. Just when I thought it faded on my lips, I took a sip of water and found that it was just as strong on the glass. I ended up giving it away. The balm, not the glass.<br /><br />My issue with the scent could very well be negative association with that moisturizer, and maybe it isn't as strong as I think it is, but I can't keep this on. The tint is minimal as well, so the color doesn't make it worth it.\n",
      "20043->Falls apart quickly, fine mist spray, very small size | 2 | 0 | I wanted a spray bottle to sparingly disperse a mild bleach-and-water solution onto counters and into my toilet bowls, but didn't want a full-size bottle. My experience with full-size bottles is that you never know what you're getting in terms of quality. Unfortunately, I should have applied the same logic to these bottles. Lesson learned.<br /><br />These are really small. These are well-suited for misting hair, or misting plants, or spraying a solution into the air. That said, they also serve the purpose for which I needed such a bottle. There's no setting on these, and no way to turn them \"off\", if that is important to you.<br /><br />The bottle is sturdy plastic. The screw-cap is sturdy and secures tightly with no leaks, allowing me to shake my solution before use. At first use, this worked great for the first three days. Sprays were consistent and never missed a beat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at some point on the third day, the top of the trigger popped up and out of place, and the whole trigger assembly came apart. I am fairly mechanically inclined, and figured out, after some effort, how to put the whole thing back together. However, the same fault kept occurring. It seems the whole assembly is merely held together by very light connections, where things click together. If the top of the trigger pops out of place, the whole thing comes apart.<br /><br />My solution to this was to wrap an elastic hair-tie around the top of the trigger to the base of the trigger, just behind the actual trigger. This keeps the top from popping off and solves the problem. However, nobody should have to do that.<br /><br />I am still able to use the one bottle in this fashion, and I really can't complain. I put the second bottle away for the inevitable failure of the first one. I can't really recommend these.\n",

This company does not and will not stand buy it's stated information on it's this product.  The twine that it's wrapped around the handle inorder to be able to hold onto the brush came completely unwound. I contacted the company and the reply I received was.<br />Re tie the twine so you can continue using the brush.<br />First off it's impossible to<br />\" Re tie \" the twine and get it to stay on and as I see it it's not my fault that the anti slip twine came undone under normal everyday use.<br />What they state in the information written when read was that they stand by the item for 90 day's and there is a lifetime warranty on the item. Hell it's a little over a month old and I can't get them to replace the item as they stated they would.<br />Just another scam company from China.  Just to bad the shower brush is pretty good for the money and worked well until the non slip twine came unraveled making it impossible to hold with soapy hands.  Customer service seems to be non existent with this company.\n",
      "20073->Very nice mascara but a little bit overpriced | 4 | 0 | This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.\n",
      "20138->100% Pure Squalane | 5 | 0 | You can pay a pretty penny for a skin care product that has a percentage of squalane in it, but this is 100% squalane.<br />I really like that this is plant based, as opposed to being derived from sharks, after all the result is the same.<br />A few drops and parched skin is instantly soft with just a touch of  glow. Or you can mix it with any other skincare product or even a foundation, in order to make it more hydrating.<br />No fragrance whatsoever, so scent sensitive people will love this.<br />Another thing to appreciate is that the bottle and dropper are both glass.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />On its own or as an additive in a DIY creation, this may be clear, but it's liquid gold.\n",
      "20142->Not what I expected. | 2 | 0 | My husband likes it...  I really did not like the two toned look.  Too drastic for me.<br />I will probably dye it another color.  i get what I pay for... Should have just bought the shoes  for the cost instead.\n",

      "20204->Wanted to like these, but the results were poor | 2 | 0 | I really wanted to like these tweezers and they're not doing what I need them to do. The great thing about the tweezers is the edges are sharp (not sharp as in you will be cut). Sharp edges are good and bad, but mostly bad in my situation. I'm not able to &#34;pluck&#34; hairs because every time I try to pluck, the hair is cut at the root!  I'm then left with the hair still under the surface when I prefered to have plucked the hair.<br /><br />Two stars were given because the pricing is good and you get three tweezers in the set, but I guess that doesn't mean too much if you can't use the products for the intended purpose.\n",
      "20243->Nice Bamboo Brush but Bass Brush Is Better | 4 | 0 | I like everything about this brush except for the handle which is much too short in my very petite hands. I cannot even imagine someone with average or large hands trying to hold onto this. Perhaps the issue is that I have very long, nearly to my butt straight hair, but I somehow doubt it. While this is a nice brush, Bass Brush is still the winner (link: https://amzn.to/2Y72DVJ)<br />The comb that comes with this is plastic. Not my thing at all. I wont be keeping it.<br />I'm keeping this brush in my vehicle, using my Bass in my home where my hair is brushed most often.<br />Overall, would have been a great brush if the handle was longer.\n",
      "20247->Smooth and shine | 5 | 0 | Very excellent shampoo, smooth, shine soft, light Weight, manageable<br />I used also the conditioner treatment for 5 min, just blow dry hair and ready to go<br /><br />My hair is the typical latina hair\n",
      "20256->Very nice mattes and lots of beautiful shimmers/glitters | 5 | 0 | This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue. So for paying less than $10 this palette is well worth it in my eyes.\n",
      "20262->Perfect for my curly hair! | 4 | 0 | A silk pillowcase isn't enough when you live in a dry climate with curly hair that is prone to frizz. It's exposed to the elements, with minimal protection. Regardless of the product you use, there are still a million other things a woman must contend with such as hormones, aging, etc., that don't help. I notice a huge difference with my hair when sleeping with a satin cap.<br /><br />I definitely recommend for medium-thick, mid-length hair. After trying several caps, this is the best quality thus far. I love the size, and after several washes, the material is intact, and the caps still feel silky. I wash these in either the hand wash or delicate cycle in cold water in my machine. Hang dry.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />- The band of the cap around my head is slightly large, so wearing it as it doesn't work for me.<br />- I sleep with a sleep mask. The mask will press the lining of the band against my forehead, creating a god awful line that will last a good majority of the day.<br /><br />Solution:<br />- Roll up the band once or twice. This prevents lines from forming on my forehead, and the cap stays in place much better.\n",
      "20279->Pretty good. Just different. | 5 | 0 | I want to warn you, if you are buying this curling flat iron in the US, it has a EU plug, so you will need to buy a US adapter. They are very inexpensive. I didnt know this so when it arrived and I seen that it had the EU plug, I had to order the adapter.<br />I have only used this once. Setting the temperature is a bit tricky. The little comblike feature on the sides is different. I liked the way it added that little bit of curl to my hair. It will take me a little time to get used to working with it on my hair. However, I do think once I get used to it I will love it.\n",

It would reoease the oil almost as soon as I pulled it from the bottle. I figured out though that I needed to asjist how the bulb was sitting in the cap as it was loose. That fixed the issue, though I'm worried it will become loose again and spill the oil,  which is a little worrisome as i usually store oils with the dropper lid on.\n",

      "20402->Fantastic face mask | 5 | 0 | This is a very nice sheet face mask. When you open the package the mask is loaded with the mask which is nice, but it is not dripping which you don’t want. You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin. In this box, that btw is perfect as a gift as well, you get 10 masks for just $24, which I think is a very good price and allows you to do something good for your skin for some time.\n",

Would most definitely order from him again. THANK YOU!\n",
      "20436->\"It's fancy, and it IS what it says it IS\"... | 4 | 0 | It comes in a nice looking metal can. It says it is a MEDIUM SHINE and a MEDIUM HOLD styling aid and my years of research trying endless styling aids to tame my 80s' bowl do genetics concurs 100%. Seriously though, my hair has like 5% body to it so I shifted to short/shorter hairstyles about 5 years ago which are easier to control. My hair is on the thicker side and very straight<br /><br />It most definitely looks like a putty with a semi-firm smooth texture and a white color. The SNIFF does seem to have notes of black pepper and pipe tobacco but they are dulled way down likely to avoid being overbearing or offensive. The HOLD is flexible and can be molded/shaped. There is a slight oiliness or greasy \"to the touch\" feel but that is quite normal when you're talking about \"medium\" or \"high\" shine hair products.<br /><br />I used it on my \"mini mini faux hawk\" and it allowed me to form it together on top and it held which not all medium/medium products accomplish. I emulsified it in my fingers and applied it to DRY hair. I am very happy with how it works for this style of cut. All in all, a nice product which works splendidly for my favorite style of cut.\n",
      "20449->What You Would Expect from a 17 Dollar Set | 3 | 0 | Pros-This makeup brush set has everything you would ever need to create a certain look. The brushes are firmly attached to the wooden handle and I liked the compact carrier case it came with. It's a great beginner's set and will get the job done.<br /><br />Cons-The brushes themselves are cheaply made. The synthetic fibers of the brush leave your makeup streaky and leaves little black hairs all over your face. The brushes are also not full enough and don't pick up enough of the makeup you're using (Especially highlighter with the fan brushes)  and so you have to go over them again and again to get full color.<br /><br />Conclusion: A good brush set for beginners, but you'd be better off splurging on a better brush set than trying to save money with these junky brushes if you're a makeup guru.\n",
      "20460->Liquid Separated On Lid... | 3 | 0 | Received this eyeliner as a Birthday gift. I am disappointed in saying that it isn't a winner in my book. Unfortunately, once the liner was on my lash line/lid it seemed to separate a bit. Not what anyone wants.<br /><br />If I am not using a liquid precision felt tip liner, I will say that the flexible brush tip on this particular brand is nice.<br /><br />Simply put, I would expect more quality in their overall liquid product, especially with it's price tag.\n",

It cleans pores and leaves your skin with a tight feeling.  Again and again I have seen these products be successful with various skins types and conditions.<br /><br />Though of course you never want to get anything like this in your eyes, but I found that this burns more than most other products I’ve used.  I usually use this in the shower and other products if I’m simply washing at the sink.\n",
      "20493->158 F seemed to be the best temperature | 3 | 0 | The package states that the beans were manufactured on 1/29/2021 and expire 1/28/2024. I did find that the was cracked at some times while using, which surprised me because the strip wasn't too thin at all with good edges and wasn't too cool. But the biggest surprise to me was that it was at the correct consistency at 158 vs 130 like the bag advertises.<br />The main ingredient of this product is pine resin and I could smell the pine in the beans as soon as they began melting.\n",

I purchase for the shine and the hold.<br />As advertised, this is a medium shine, medium hold putty.<br />It goes in nice and thick/sticky and holds well throughout the day. It looks more natural, not like you gooped a bunch of gel in your hair. This brand is new to me, but it is performing well so far, and I would recommend giving it a try!\n",

      "20548->Powerful Nail Lamp | 4 | 0 | I've reviewed many nail lamps and I like this one because of the color, the ease of operation and how quickly it dries my nails. It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands). Overall it's a decent nail lamp but the price feels a little high for this type of item.\n",
      "20561->Cool box | 4 | 0 | Love the box. I took the pins out and put them in the drawer.<br />Nothing too special about the pins.<br />Haven’t used them out.<br />I use the box for my tweezers and such.<br />Looks good on my bathroom sink\n",

I used the small circle extractor tool and that has been the only one I've needed so far. I'm sure in a few weeks I will have the opportunity to try the others but that one was perfect for me. I also used the pointy tool and it worked as expected to remove a whitehead from my cheek.

      "20689->Not the best option | 3 | 0 | I bought this Every Man Jack SPF 30 Body Defense lotion about a year ago and have used it a few times, but unfortunately, I have not been impressed with the product. While it does provide the necessary SPF 30 protection, the lotion has a heavy, greasy texture that left my skin feeling gross. Additionally, I found that it did not absorb well and left a white residue on my skin. I had to stop using it after a few uses, and I ended up tossing it and finding something better.<br /><br />Overall, if you're in the market for a sun protection lotion, I would recommend looking for something else. While this product may work for some people, it did not meet my expectations and I was disappointed with the results.\n",

The bristles were soft, it cleaned great, it was portable, and it didn't take up room on the sink.  I thought it was wonderful and was very happy with it.<br /><br />A few days ago, it started working intermittantly. I replaced the batteries.  Still worked intermittantly. I replaced the batteries. It made a faint humming sound. I knew there was a problem and decided to look up reviews on the internet. I saw people were having the same experience and it was due to water leakage ruining the batteries.<br /><br />I will contact the Philips Co. and let them know.  I really love this toothbrush and hope they will correct the leak situation.  When they do, I would definitely buy a new one.\n",

It<br />will not give a close shave no matter how hard I press or what direction I move it. I don't like cleaning it after every use. The side burn trimmer is nearly useless (too short and poorly located). I used my old Norelco for my last shave and it still shaves much closer. The side burn trimmer on the old one is great. I clean it only when it is full of whiskers and it has worked well for three years. I am glad I didn't throw it away. I do like the charging system and the display on the 1090 but the cord should be coiled and stretchy. The cord is  difficult to store.\n",

The jar on the left is the one I received today.  The new container is bigger but contains over 26% less product. Same price as when you got 3.4 grams.<br />I like the product but it is pretty disappointing to be misled by seller. They even stuck a sticker on the product box which says 3.4 g very clearly next to what is preprinted on the product box indicating it is 2.5 g.\n",

I really liked the previous product.<br />This product seemed fine but the first time I used it it felt grainy in my fingers and on my face. I kept using it hoping it would change but the product I have is just grainy. It has the texture of an exfoliating product rather than a moisturizer.\n",

Each bottle is double-packed in bubble pack, and all accessories are wrapped up so they can't move around and damage the glass bottles. Even though the shipping box was beat up, the bottles were all 100% fine.<br /><br />The glass is of good quality in terms of thickness, and quite sturdy (as far as glass can be, however). The brown tinting is excellent for UV protection of the contents. The accessories are mostly useful items, with the best ones being the caps and the funnel. The caps have an insert to provide an excellent seal, which is key to maintaining content freshness. They also come with spray heads that, while functional, are rather lightweight in terms of build quality.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent set of bottles that are packaged very well, and come with some very useful extras. Very pleased!\n",
      "20865->Works well. | 3 | 0 | Gave 3 stars due to none of the bands that was provided did not fit my blow dryer. My blow dryer was to wide but I made the biggest one fit. I tightened the 2 pieces to make it fit and it worked well.<br /><br />I have what they call 4C hair and my did not break the comb as some have mentioned.\n",

This is super high quality and the size is bigger than I thought too.<br />And when you put things in it, it takes more than I thought I could put. It's really really great purchase\n",
      "20886->Assembled terribly - has/had potential : ( | 2 | 0 | The pictures in the listing make this look soooooo pretty.  Upon arrival I thought it looked cute enough, but then I actually tried to use it and it is not so great at all. : (  First, I hate the comb – but it is able to be used – but barely.  It is comprised of looped wire.  It is actually pretty short tines considering this piece is so long too.  It really needs a better comb with longer and sturdier tines – even a simple plastic one would have been better – to make this sturdy and stay in your hair.<br /><br />The worst thing, though, is the way that it is assembled with the flowing crystal wires.  Mine was assembled very poorly and because of the way it is wired – the “flowing” crystals all severely hang to the right side.  It looks TERRIBLE. : (  It looks like my hair has somehow caught on the thing and is just pulling it to the side of my head.  If it were wired well and things balanced in the middle properly – it would probably look very nice.<br /><br />I may have to end up trashing this but I am going to get out my jewelry tool kit and attempt to clip the wires, reposition, fix, and rewire this thing.  Then again – it may not be worth all the trouble.  As it is it is completely unusable and unwearable…<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )\n",
      "20889->GREAT SIZE Make-up Bag | 4 | 0 | I purchased this item as a Christmas gift.  The bag is a larger size than expected and I love that it came with a strap.<br />It has plenty of places to place all of your make-up and the mirror is an added bonus.  I can't predict how long the bag will endure, but the material is very good.  Time will tell.\n",
      "20890->Easy peasy perfect foot peel | 4 | 0 | Likes<br />- easy to use just tear and put it on. The tearing of the mask need a scissor to cut not like their foot moisturing mask just tear. Which I like.<br />- smell wonderful, wear and sit back. Even though you can move around doing your thing but best just relax.<br />- the magic happen the 3rd day even though I can see some skin drying up the 2nd days.<br />- smooth skin coming out on the 5th days in my case.

      "20927->Smells funky, but no tears | 4 | 0 | As the product information boasts, these makeup wipes don't burn your eyes and cause tears when you use it! As someone with sensitive eyes, I would be the first to report if there was a problem. I'd also be the first to report if the added vitamin E oil caused a breakout, and it did not. I don't use foundation makeup, so I only used it to wipe off eye makeup, but I didn't get any breakouts near my eye area or forehead.<br />There is an odd smell to these wipes, but if you chalk it up to the 'healthy' aspect (we all know health food stores smell weird) it shouldn't bother you. It's not long lasting, so you won't smell it as you drift off to sleep. These are easy to glide over your face, and with lots of acreage per wipe if you do wear foundation. I also tested it with waterproof mascara, and it took it off extremely easily!\n",

      "20948->Works great for wearing jeans with different heels heights | 2 | 0 | Update: I can no longer recommend these. At first I loved them, but they can only be used once or twice, and then the two parts lose their ability to stay together. The piece that goes on the back just won't hold onto the post. Buy these only if you're willing to consider them to be disposable.<br /><br />HOW TO USE: twist while pulling apart. There's a little indentation on the side of the post; if you don't twist, they hold tight.<br /><br />Hem Gems work great for me. I just turn the pant leg under, and put one of these at each side seam. I used to use double-sided tape, but it really wasn't strong enough for denim. The embossed words and design are appropriate for jeans, but I wouldn't use them on dressy pants.\n",
      "20998->Stopped working in less than a year | 2 | 0 | Updated: has completely stopped working in less than a year. Tried changing the batteries and it turns on for a few seconds and then immediately turns off. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Original Review: ordered this after buying and returning a slightly cheaper version that wouldn't turn on. This was DEFINITELY worth the extra money. It's sturdy and looks much more expensive than it actually is. The lights are bright without being overwhelming, and the different settings let you pick between lighting levels. I purchased this product to use in vocal study and while teaching voice lessons, but I'd definitely recommend it for the more common uses of makeup application and skincare as well!\n",
      "21022->Not Really Sure Who This Brush Is For | 2 | 0 | While this is a nice looking & seemingly well designed brush, I'm not really sure who it's best suited for.<br /><br />My wife has been in search of a brush for fine hair. And while this brush is described to work on fine hair, it barely even brushed through the surface of her hair.<br /><br />The bristles are so soft that it can't really grip. So just kind of glides over.<br /><br />It may be useful more as a beard brush, but unfortunately, that's not what it's being sold as.<br /><br />Giving it 2 stars for being a well made brush (wood handle is very nice), but just not very useful for its intended purpose, brushing!\n",
      "21031->Spa treatment at home | 5 | 0 | This is an interesting product for sure. You get a jar with cream that looks very cute in my eyes but that is not all. You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well. All in all very happy with this and it makes for a fantastic gift!\n",
      "21065->Love the packaging | 4 | 0 | I love that this product doesn’t come in a plastic bottle! The scent is very natural, woody type smell. I personally enjoy the scent, it does not smell like the usual perfume type. The bar lathered up enough to get my hair and scalp clean, but not as much as traditional liquid shampoo. I enjoy less of a lather, it makes my hair feel clean but not stripped and dried out. It rinsed out well and didn’t leave product residue. I’m very interested in trying all the different varieties now!<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this product, it gets the job done without using any plastic! Good for your hair and the environment!\n",
      "21068->I like this heated eye mask | 4 | 0 | I like this heated eye mask, for the most part, I especially like that it exists in the first place! I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br /><br />The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br /><br />The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br /><br />I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br /><br />The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat. Usually, to counterbalance this I place one of my arms over the heating mask to apply weight and increase the intensity of the heat.\n",
      "21083->Scrubby Super Moisturizing Exfoliator! | 5 | 0 | If you use this body scrub after you use soap it leaves a nice layer of moisture on your skin. I mostly feel the silica and rice powder when using this in the shower. It rinses nice and clean and leaves skin refreshed and renewed. This has lovely mango seed butter in it too. I used about a third of this tube in one full-body use. Think of it as a nice spa treatment!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

My brows are not that defined in the first place so putting this product over what I have already doesn't work. Plus the color I chose I just way too dark... Looks unnatural.<br />There are a lot of stencils to choose from. But trying to hold them in place is difficult. The applicator is just too big I think. I smaller one could make the application more precise. Idk... I'm just not liking this whole concept I guess. Not sure I'll even try another brand.\n",
      "21096->Great Beard Oil | 4 | 0 | For the money, this is straight up a great beard oil. It smells nice, and the scent is very light. It makes my beard nice and soft and helps stop any itching or irritation to my neck skin.<br />I use only 3 drops and get very good coverage over my entire face.<br />The cedar scent is very pleasing and calming to me.<br />Thanks for making a great product!<br />I would have gave Five Stars, but frankly the 4oz bottle of Beardsman Bold Forest was better for the money in my opinion.<br />It would be nice if I could get the same deal on this oil for Four ounces like that.\n",
      "21097->Cute Clips | 5 | 0 | This review is for the large size. The size is something you might want to consider if you have thin or fine hair. Just know what you're getting.<br /><br />They hold well and are super cute.\n",
      "21108->It may work? | 3 | 0 | I'm a lash-addict!  I have all the really nice mascaras (Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Dior) and for a year I got regular eye-lash extensions twice a month. I really wanted to like this but I can't.  I put it on morning and night for five days straight, and I always woke up (and spent the day) with itchy eyes.  I tried to convince myself that it was something in the air, but when I forgot to use it I was just fine.  So I stopped using it and I was just fine.<br /><br />However, I do believe in the concept.  My family in Jamaica swear by putting coconut (or castor) oil on the lashes daily to keep them supple.  When they're moisturized they don't fall off as fast, and putting on mascaras certainly aid in drying out the lashes.  I try the oil-on-the-lashes thing but I've made the decision to stop using this product.\n",
      "21112->Average | 3 | 0 | Certainly well priced and effective though not impressive.<br />It’s a wet mud mask which I did not find as moisturizing as dry mud masks, nor did my face feel particularly cleaner or tighter.<br />It didn’t however feel dried or stripped. It’s comparable to most drugstore masks so it’s really fine just not a wow product.\n",
      "21129->Very nice set, makes for a great gift too | 5 | 0 | In this pack you get 7 masks for just over $42, so these run you for over $6 a masks. These are on the more expensive side of the spectrum but not yet the most expensive ones I have tried. This is an interesting set of masks that provides you with 6 different types of masks and a double for the hydrating type. You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.\n",

      "21169->Pretty natural looking | 5 | 0 | Finally, after over a year of having these, I actually tried them out! I’ve never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I’ve had them a year without using them - lol!). I’ve seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I’m going, mine should last forever!<br />I don’t have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it’s definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I’ve used in the past. It’s a little tricky to get them in the best spot. Like I said previously though, I think this will get much easier the more times I try them. It comes with tweezers to use but it was almost easier for me to apply them without using them. Once in place, I was amazed at how well they stayed in place!<br />They were easy to remove and the eyeliner did require makeup remover to get it off, but it also came off without a problem.<br />I didn’t wear them long. I will have to get used to how they feel; it wasn’t uncomfortable, just different for me. I have very thin, light-colored eyelashes so I think I’m really going to enjoy these!<br />(Excuse my bad photos too - no other makeup whatsoever on and first attempt so I look pretty awful - lol But I actually love the lashes!)\n",
      "21199->Arrived wasted | 3 | 0 | Update: I raised it from one star to three stars because the acrylic is actually really good. I’m a beginner, but my nails came out really food. If they could learn to close the acrylic correctly so the whole product arrives this would easily be 4/5 stars. The fact that you can’t even request a replacement is ridiculous.<br /><br />They don’t let you do returns or replacements because they already know their product will arrive open. Terrible. Amazon needs to address this because they are taking our money.\n",
      "21215->This was a pretty interesting item | 4 | 0 | This was a pretty interesting item. I have very long hair and it a task to try out different hair style. With the help of these sponge it was so much easier to try put new styles on my hair. Only one problem I faced was that I could not do this on my own. I needed help from one more person as I have very long hair and by the time I pulled it out of the sponge it was haywire.<br /><br />But for people with hair smaller then waist line will be fine. It s nice to keep all hair in one place. This is a pack of 4 with two small and two large sponge. Totally recommended for shorter hair.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.\n",

      "21245->Moisturizes as promised and mattifies beautifully | 5 | 0 | I have used a few products by Follain to this date so I was curious to see how this mattifying moisturizer would perform. It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.\n",

      "21255->Great as shampoo or soap | 5 | 0 | My scalp was itchy from just about every shampoo I tried...I bought this because I take black seed oil internally and often eat the black seeds and honey from The Blessed Seed.  I figured for a small investment I could always shower with this if I didn't like using it as shampoo.  First observation is that it cleaned my scalp very well...If I put black seed on my<br />scalp before bed, using the shampoo/soap in the morning removed all residue...But I do require a good conditioner afterwards because I feel this bar strips my hair a bit too much.  I don't use it every day...although I have washed my face and body with this soap and I like the sense of clean I feel.  Overall a good product...A bit on the pricy side and probably<br />won't last too  long but I liked it and would purchase it again.\n",

      "21266->Had high hopes, not sure if it really works. Smells like old cabbage | 2 | 0 | I had high hopes when I ordered these pills. Since this quarantine I've decided to let my hair grow and thanks to the wonders of getting older I've noticed I have some thinning at the top of my head (around the crown).<br /><br />When these pills arrived first thing I noticed was the smell. They smell horrible - like old cabbage. But I learned to never judge a book by it's cover.  I decided to take anyway.<br /><br />I've been taking for a little over 2 weeks as my hair has grown, but I don't know if it's just natural growth. My hair has filled in somewhat in the thinning areas but I think this is what it would have done anyway.  I will continue to take and update my review if my beard / head hair fills in.<br /><br />Pros<br />Good quantity<br /><br />Cons<br />Not sure if it works<br />Smells horrible - like old cabbage\n",
      "21267->I really wanted to like this and I do, except, my sensitivities can’t take it | 4 | 0 | I will fully admit up front, I have a very bad sensitivity to scents. In my years of life I’ve only found maybe half a dozen I can put up with. I usually avoid them - but because I enjoy them - I do try to find ways to use it. Because of these sensitivities I try not to “blame” the product, unless it burns - then I have to question what all is in there. In this case, I decided to try Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine because of other reviews - I was hoping... but sadly, nope, I can’t do it. So I’m giving it 4 stars 1. because I do like the smell, but 2. it lasts far too long, smelled like it got stronger than lighter, and in the end, was too much for me. I got the Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine and both my wife and I liked the smell, but immediately worried it would be too much based on first sniffs. I put it on, and it worked great. It’s easy to put on - only a small amount covered my hair easily - and smelled nice. It was easy to work with my hair and it looked great. But as time went on, this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty started to smell more and more and more. The smell did not dissipate, but grew. And my head started to really hurt.<br />In the end, I do like this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine for how it works and how it looks. But for sensitive guys, you need to be aware, this putty has a strong scent - in my case at least, too strong. I won’t be able to keep using it.\n",
      "21271->Hair is lovely and reverts back after washing it! | 4 | 0 | I was pleased that her hair reverted back after I washed it. It's great to finally see more and more cosmetology mannequins with African textured hair that actually reverts back to its coily texture after you wash it. So often in the past, sellers would advertise cosmetology mannequins as having afro hair, then you washed it and the coil pattern was completely gone. The money I lost trying to find a real African textured cosmetology mannequin back in the day, was unbelievable!<br /><br />A few things to note.....While washing her hair there was tons of shedding. I've come to realize this is quite normal. However, after the washing is said and done, the shedding is minimal. Thank goodness because there are cosmetology mannequins where the shedding continues in massive balls even after washing.<br /><br />The ends are thin and stringy and that's where I'll take a one star deduction. She'll be gettin a good trim here soon, but I definitely recommend her. I'd say her hair is in the 3b/3c range? I could be off about that because I'm still a bit shaky on the hair typing system. Either way, you'll definitely be satisfied with your purchase.<br /><br />I've attached pictures of before washing her hair, after washing her hair and what her hair looks like after I dried it and dry combed it. Lovely soft hair. I almost didn't wanna ruin the rod set because it was so cute but I always wash the hair of any cosmetology mannequin I buy, right outta the box.\n",
      "21293->Not a bad set but also not fantastic | 3 | 0 | In this set you get a keratin shampoo and keratin conditioner. Both of them are sulfate free which is great, however when I read the ingredients it turns out that the shampoo actually has silicone in it, not a fan of that. Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.\n",
      "21306->Missing purple!!! | 2 | 0 | The purple has no color! Not like its dried up - it literally has no color in the pen. Super disappointed because it was a gift and the persons favorite color is purple...OF COURSE! UGH!<br />I'm giving it 2 stars because the other colors work but they should ALL work.\n",
      "21332->This is one of my staples! | 5 | 0 | I feel like the negative reviewers may have received an expired product.<br />I have had no issues with the texture, integrity, or the smell (it smells like a sweet pastry).<br />It feels just like lipstick with a bit of sugar mixed in, that's all.<br />I barely twist it up and don't grind it into my lips - I make small back and forth motions all the way around my mouth using all sides of the crayon to get the maximum amount of the \"grit\", and then rub my lips together.<br />If that sounds weird, you don't have to do it that way. Sugar is a natural exfoliant without having to scrub it in, because of the glycolic acid. It also is a humectant.\n",
      "21333->Results:  Worse than when I started | 1 | 0 | I have used Elastiderm cream with good results for years.  I tried this in September, 2012 and used consistently for almost 2 years now.  The only good thing I can say is that it lasts a long time.  However, as for results, not only did I see no results, it GAVE me dark circles and puffiness where I'd never really had any before.<br /><br />Can't recommend as much as I'd like to.  I like Obagi products but this one did more damage than good.\n",

      "21347->Nail Clips | 4 | 0 | I mainly got these for a “home-made” gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked! They don’t pinch at all; even my mom used them and said she could barely feel them.<br /><br />Light weight and fairly durable. There are enough for two people to use at the same time, or extras on hand if they ever break.<br /><br />If used for poly gels, I’m sure they would work just as well.\n",
      "21368->Beautifully scent duo that performs nicely | 5 | 0 | This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.\n",
      "21374->These are Jumbo, Not Large. | 3 | 0 | The labels says \" Hair Rollers, 12 pack.  JUMBO (large) New\".<br /><br />Jumbo is NOT large -  Jumbo is a size up from Large.  Deceptive marketing.  I needed Large.  Epic fail.\n",
      "21387->I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will ... | 5 | 0 | I have gained and lost a considerable amount of weight and we all know that this cycle normally entails stretch marks. I started using this stretch mark cream on my thigh area - where I really need help and I need this cream to work. After continuously using it for almost two weeks, I started seeing significant changes which leads me to believe that with regular use, this product will truly work wonders on stretch marks! Using this product and losing the stretch marks has given me more confidence! Summer is fast approaching and I won't be as self conscious when trying out new swimsuit styles. Thank you, Jaylie!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try.

      "21406->BEWARE! Scent Leaks! | 3 | 0 | I am very happy when I got this one coz it looks super nice and made of quality material. I got this mostly to hold hand sanitizers for my whole family so we have our own when we are out.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* perfect size! If you will travel for a week, this will be enough to hold your stuff.<br />* the silicone material is very nice, I am very impressed!<br />* wide mouth<br />* easy to refill and get your stuff out<br />* the carabiners are made of high quality metal.<br />* easy to squeeze (but be careful if it’s a hand sanitizer or water like liquid it will come out very fast so squeeze with caution)<br /><br />CONS<br />* The scent of whatever you put leaks out. You will need a a few ziplock bags to contain the scent if you are traveling or else it will be all over your luggage. If you happen to mix it with food items, expect it to taste whatever you put on this bottles.<br />* don’t use for hand sanitizers or anything with alcohol base on it. I got it mainly for holding hand sanitizers for my whole family but the scent leaks so bad that I have to not use it for the purpose. It is also not good when squeezing coz it will not give you little amount.<br />* some liquid leaks too.<br /><br />This product will be good for lotion, toothpaste or shampoo/conditioner coz they have thicker consistency. But be aware that scents leaks. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I can’t use it for the purpose I got it for (hand sanitizers)<br />If you plan to use it thicker liquids and don’t mind the scent leaks then this is perfect coz the silicone material is very nice.\n",
      "21409->Not what i was expecting. | 3 | 0 | CONs- Takes a long time to get to the US because it ships next day from china. It is shinny and looks like fake hair when it first comes. I have to spray it with dry shampoo to get the shinny out.<br />PROs- I bought 2 so there is a lot of hair!\n",
      "21419->Good product but... | 4 | 0 | I upgraded my review to 4 stars because these were lots of fun to share at a themed party.<br />They work and last a long time.<br />===============<br />What a shame to ruin the customer experience by not including instructions. Please. Instructions should be in or on the package. I should not have to come back here on my device, find the order and try to read them on my phone.  And they're in an image, not even typed out - when viewed on my tablet the image won't stay zoomed.  Crazy making.<br />Spend the pennies to print and include the instructions.<br />I like the product, though.\n",
      "21429->A Non Foaming Facial Cleanser | 3 | 0 | The first thing I noticed (and you can see in my picture) was that this product appeared to have leaked. However, there was a seal around the neck and pump, and because of this, I didn’t have a mess to deal with before I tried this facial cleanser.<br /><br />I have never used a lotion-type facial cleanser. The last two products I used, only required a pea-sized amount of product, or I would wind up with enough cleanser to clean someone else’s face too. I quickly realized that this was a different kind of cleanser. I tried one pump, and it wasn’t nearly enough. I have settled on 3 good pumps and a bit more, and that is enough to get the job done.<br /><br />I have been using this for almost two weeks now, and while I will say my skin feels soft after rinsing it off, I have discovered that I just prefer a foaming facial wash. Nothing wrong with this product, in my opinion, I am just not the right customer.\n",
      "21438->AMAZING for bleached hair! Smells amazing too! | 5 | 0 | Like many others, I bleached my hair myself during a quarantine make-over. The bleach left my hair super dry, as expected, and the conditioners I already had at home just weren't doing it for me. I purchased this amazing mask and after 1 use, my hair feels even softer and smoother than it did before I bleached it! I continue to use it once a week, and my hair gets softer and softer every time. I will definitely be buying this again.<br /><br />TIP: Rinse your hair SUPER well after using this! The first couple of times after using it I had to go back in and re-rinse my hair since some of the mask stayed in.\n",
      "21443->Do not recommend | 1 | 0 | Awful.<br />The brushes from a dollar store, are much better.<br />I waited too long, to return.\n",
      "21458->Good tools in a plush box, good for a gift | 4 | 0 | The tools are sharp and have a nice matte finish that makes them look more expensive. It's perfect for me, but as there's a logo and &#34;Pure Sir&#34; in silver on the top of the box, I'm hesitating whether to send one to my niece for her birthday. Stupid, maybe, why should it matter? It shouldn't...<br /><br />But it does. So it loses a star. I feel so shallow!\n",
      "21487->Good durability and a nice look, even the bigger sparkles do not feel rough | 5 | 0 | The color change works well. The colors themselves though are very translucent. The sparkles are large and sparse, but good quality that somehow doesn't feel rough.<br /><br />It cured up well and had decent durability. Overall I'm happy with the quality. I do wish the bottles made the colors inside a little more obvious.\n",
      "21488->Takes 2 coats to get the correct effect- Good Polish | 2 | 0 | I like this nail polish. It does take two coats to get the right result. Not sure if it will be strong or chip easily. So far so good. Bottles are small, but the price was good. I recommend this product.<br /><br />Update:  Unfortunately I had to change my rating. About 98% of this nail polish came off when I had my hands in soapy water.<br />I wanted to like this polish. I do not know what this polish is made of, is ok in plain water but will come off in soapy water. I found this out after bathing a dog. I could not believe it when I saw it but the majority of the polish was completely gone.\n",
      "21496->Quality is just ok | 3 | 0 | As others have mentioned it is difficult, if not impossible to find Swisspers cotton rounds at Cost Co.  Marmara seemed like an option given the reviews.  Marmara is smaller in diameter and thin compared to Swisspers.  Not the same quality.<br />Marmara will work, they do not seem to leave cotton fibers on my face.  Disappointed about quality.\n",
      "21504->Durable and does exactly what it claims. | 5 | 0 | This works great. It'll never give you an amazing haircut, but it can give you an even buzz. I got this to get me through the pandemic thinking if I used it twice it would pay for itself. A half dozen haircuts in it still works great.<br /><br />There is a limit to how good of a haircut you can give to yourself, but this does as good a job as I think is probably possible.\n",
      "21509->Mild to Mediocre Results | 2 | 0 | If you are looking for a minor mask for your breath then this is the product for you.<br /><br />A breath product has to be very noticeable to you, for it to make a difference to the people around you.<br />Breath product results are usually about ½ what it feels like to you.<br /><br />This spray is barely noticeable to me and my husband said there was a \"slight\" difference.<br /><br />I'm a smoker so I'm very conscious of my breath. So, strength and effectiveness are my #1 factors.<br /><br />The size of bottle is very convenient. That's probably the only good thing I could say.  This is for VERY mild breath refresher.\n",
      "21512->Quantity: yes; quality: no | 3 | 0 | If you are just looking for quantity, this is a good buy. You get a bunch at a cheap price! However, if quality is what you need, I could not recommend these. I bought this a long time ago and have barely used a few of them because they are so bad at holding and applying product. The foam is not cohesive with eyeshadow powders in my experience. It’s like trying to apply eyeshadow with cardboard :(<br />If this is for a kid playing with makeup, these would be fine. Not for anyone trying to blend or apply well.\n",
      "21517->Don't Buy This Eye Shadow ! | 1 | 0 | Extremely small amount, and it's not deep as it appears on the seller's photo. I've gotten no response after contacting seller.<br /><br />Carolyn Jones\n",
      "21519->Pretty colors, not enough different sizes. | 3 | 0 | I liked the colors, that was the main reason I bought these.<br />However, there were not enough variety in sizes. The first box had (6) size 6 nails, (5) size 2 and (0) size 3. I am familiar with press on nails and you at least get one full set from a box but these didn't even have enough different sizes to make one set.\n",
      "21530->Crap | 1 | 0 | I put cream in it and I was so excited to be able to apply cream to my back then boom I couldn’t get the plastic cover off !!! It’s stuck and it doesn’t t come off …<br />I’m waiting to get a bag large enough do it can be returned cream and all !!<br />Don’t purchase!!\n",
      "21542->Best thing is the brush. | 2 | 0 | Oh wow.<br />My packet of stuff was a little dried out, I think. I had little blobs of gel that never spread out. It had pleasant smell, dried as expected but once rinsed off had absolutely no visible effect. My skin fee soft though and nice brush, hence 2 stars\n",
      "21546->Only the lavender is pleasing to my senses; second candle is headache producing | 3 | 0 | I got the lavender and balsam fir set of soy candles. Each one comes in an 8 ounce tin. The balsam fir is headache producing to me and I hate it. However, the lavender is very nice and a faint lavender scent dissipates throughout my small kitchen when I am burning the candle.<br /><br />Each candle is $20 each at the current price of $39.99. Although they are made with essential oils, I still think that is too much for the set. Unfortunately, only one candle is agreeable to me.\n",
      "21548->Great lip scrub | 5 | 0 | This is a nice lip scrub by Simply Dana. It tastes of coconut which I personally really like. It works very well helping to exfoliate the lips in a gentle manner.<br /><br />Especially in the winter my lips are rougher shape and need a little extra help and this gets the job done.\n",
      "21563->Put the container in something before opening. The little pieces stick to the top and go everywhere. | 4 | 0 | This Makartt Nail Decoration Set is gorgeous. The only thing I don't like is the static in the containers. The pieces attach to the top of the container until you open them and then little pieces go everywhere.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plastic tray with 12 small containers inside. Each container opens and closes with a screw-top lid. Be sure to set the container in something before opening it as the contents will go everywhere, especially the small things. The containers have beads, gemstones, and charms. There are also 3 small sheets of stickers included with the kit.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Makartt Nail Decoration Set to family and friends.\n",
      "21573->I must be crazy! | 1 | 0 | This product is too expensive and took way to long to arrive. There is no scent in the vanilla and it did nothing  when I used exactly the way instructed.<br />It leaves an odd residue on my skin.\n",
      "21581->For The Price, Hard Pass | 2 | 0 | I purchased the .3 ounce tube (the small tube, whatever size it is) and it definitely wasn't worth the $17 that it cost.<br /><br />The cream isn't bad, per se. Though it was difficult to tell if it was really working since it only lasted about two weeks of nightly applications (being EXTREMELY stingy with the amount used). In that time my skin didn't have any bad reaction and maybe seemed a bit more uniform. But not enough to justify shelling out $60 for a full tub of the cream.<br /><br />The odor took some getting used to, but it isn't pungent. It just isn't pleasant. Has a very medicinal/bitter scent.<br /><br />It did seem like a quality cream, but, again, no idea if it works. And I don't plan to spend the crazy amount for more. I'll stick to the Neutrogena Deep Wrinkle night cream, which does work (quite well, I might add) and is a literal fraction of the cost.\n",
      "21584->Formula is great but colors are not as Pictured | 4 | 0 | I absolutely love these gel<br />Polishes. The formula is great and they do not chip.<br />However the colors are different in person than pictured.\n",
      "21593->Small | 4 | 0 | Because of all the pandemic craziness making things hard to get, I ordered these out of desperation. Normally we get the Amazon Basics baby wipes, which are an inch wider. The smallness is okay, we can throw these in the diaper bag or glove compartment. But for everyday butt wiping, I prefer the Amazon Basics, and will use those till we run out.<br />They are soft, there is no strong scent.  They are fine.\n",
      "21596->Does the job but awkwardly | 3 | 0 | You have to hold down power button to make it work you have to keep<br />Clicking between cycles. Tilting the reservoir is weird. It works but not too simply for the price it is good.\n",
      "21608->Wish came with nail molds. Worth the money spent. | 3 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:5eac84c56645a29734dde4db70a5e090]] Wish came with nail molds too<br />Try with color u don’t like for first 2-3 times cause If you are new to gel nails you would surely mess up.<br />Try one nail at a time for first time.\n",
      "21622->Good texture, smell, & packaging | 4 | 0 | I like the packaging for this product, but it was my first switch to aluminum free.<br /><br />It didn’t work as well as I wanted, but am going to give it another try once my body detox’s.\n",
      "21634->WARNING: Nothing like the picture | 3 | 0 | Ryan wig is nothing like the picture that’s why I gave it a 3-star. However, I get compliments on the hair. It’s has a wet and wavy look. Plus, I’m black and I wear my hair completely natural normally (no relaxer or flat irons). I have become accustomed to me tamed wild look so it fits my personality.<br /><br />One more thing, tangles very easily but it is a cheap wig so I can live with it.\n",
      "21652->A favorite | 5 | 0 | I have tried a lot of different types and brands of soap and this one is a stand out for me. I love everything about it beginning with it’s scent. The scent for some reason gives me a warm fuzzy feeling and makes my morning showers feel just a bit nicer.<br /><br />I like the shape of the soap very much because it makes the bar easier to hang onto in the shower.<br /><br />The soap lathers very well and leaves my skin feeling clean and like it has been pampered.\n",
      "21665->This vanilla scent is totally unique | 5 | 0 | I love this scent.  It is not as sweet.  I love a good sweet vanilla, and have many.  However, this scent I think has cardamom and is really natural smelling.  It lasts good and the scent has a fullness to it from the other notes.<br />  Totally like no other.\n",
      "21667->WIfe disapponted - I know Panasonic can make better products than this! | 2 | 0 | Looking forward to Panasonic creating the same quality razor for women as they do for men.<br /><br />This 'top of the line' electric razor was encased in plastic and hard to open. The materials used in the razor itself unfortunately matched that lack of quality. Cutting heads were rudimentary and did not provide a close or even shave. My wife is going back to a blade not because she loves it, but at least it works as an effective tool.\n",
      "21668->Great Quality for the price! Awesome deal! | 5 | 0 | I love this lamp! This lamp has both UV & LED lights. There are three timer settings; 30, 60, & 90 seconds plus has a sensor that will automatically turn on the lamp when you insert your fingers/toes.<br />The plate on the bottom is removable if you use it for toes.  I would absolutely order this again if I needed to!\n",
      "21676->Fallout Galore | 2 | 0 | Got it for $9 at an official colourpop retailer on clearance. the pros are as follows:<br />Rich colors<br />highly pigmented<br />solid color variety<br />nice quality glitter on the glittery colors<br />cute overall look<br />Cons:<br />Tons of fallout! The lightest touch cover your brush with too much product, so you end up wasting a ton tapping it off or even just by picking up product.<br />Some colors are crumbly<br />The gold glitter color is definitely more yellow than gold<br />The brown in the bottom right corner is more of a chocolate brown than an actual deep blackish brown espresso color (can companies please stop calling colors \"espresso\" if they've never actually looked at a shot of espresso before?)<br />The pallet dirties easily due to all of the fallout<br /><br />For 9 bucks it wasn't a bad buy, but i probably wouldn't spend much more than that due to the horrendous amount of fallout.\n",
      "21693->super soft feels great on gums and leaves no film on teeth | 4 | 0 | So far I really love this toothbrush. I have sensitive gums, they bleed, been told I am an aggressive brusher though I do not feel like I am, I mean you are supposed to actually \"brush,\" how dainty are you supposed to be?! This toothbrush is very comfy soft, it feels great and does not make my gums sore at all which is usually the case, so this is my new nighttime toothbrush that I use with regular toothpaste. The only downside to this is it does not brush your tongue well, and give me a weird gag reflex when I try because of the texture. I still use a silicone toothbrush<br />https://smile.amazon.com/AutoWT-Toothbrush-Silicone-Double-Sided-Comfort/dp/B07PRBCH9T/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=dog+silicone+toothbrush&qid=1635026249&sr=8-14<br />with my homemade toothpowder in the morning because it is actually better than this one for brushing your tongue, but this soft one has not left any film build up on the teeth like the silicone one will if I use it exclusively. I will continue to purchase these.\n",
      "21717->I am so happy with this moisturizer | 5 | 0 | I have been provided a discounted cost to provide an honest opinion/feedback of this product after use.<br />This is my honest and true feedback.<br />I am so happy with this moisturizer.<br />Shipping was super fast<br />Packaging was tight<br />actual product packaging is very nice and trendy.  Definitely eye catching.  I love having it displayed on my vanity.<br />I am very happy with the results.  It does exactly what was stated in the description.<br />It is very lightweight, not oily at all.  I love how it feels.<br />I will continue to purchase this item once this one is gone.<br />Definitely recommend to YOU.\n",
      "21719->Pretty but stinky | 3 | 0 | My daughter, grand daughter and I liked them except for one thing: THEY STINK!<br />Very very strong chemical smell that when worn transfers to your hair.<br />It is a definite love/hate relationship.\n",
      "21737->Nice Serum, No Effects | 3 | 0 | No changes to fine lines.<br /><br />ReVive Intensite Moisture Serum makes my skin feel soft and smooth, but I don't see any changes in my fine lines.  There's no added plumping and for the price of this serum, I'd like to see some effects!<br /><br />It feels nice going on and has a pleasant smell, but I won't be adding it to my beauty shelf.\n",
      "21746->Very cheap and painful to wear | 2 | 0 | Its very pretty but very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.<br /> But the \"diamonds\" broke off and disconnected from the headband before I got to use it. I wouldn't waste your $8.  Its painful to wear. Only good thing is amazon refunded my money.\n",
      "21752->👎👎👎 | 1 | 0 | Junk junk junk<br />Waste of money\n",
      "21754->Brush head is too large IMHO | 3 | 0 | I'm happy to be using a toothbrush that is good for our environment but I sure wish the bristle area was smaller.  I have a small mouth and I just can't get the large brush head where I need to.<br />If the manufacturer starts making one with a smaller round head I'll get more. If not then I'm back to the plastic handle.  😒\n",
      "21769->Really big bottle! My husband loves it | 5 | 0 | My husband has a very thick beard, and maintaining it is a lot easier with some beard oil. This bottle took me by surprise, it has a dropper top similar to those in essential oil bottles (which makes sense with the dark blue bottle and it being made with oils like jojoba)<br />The oil goes on easy, he can just shake a few drops out and rub it in.<br /><br />He uses a boar bristle brush to help him get the oil down to the skin, it helps his beard stay softer and it has grown a lot longer than he usually lets it get. By now he usually gets fed up of it being itchy and shaves, but the oil stops the itchy issue.<br /><br />The bottle is 4 ounces, so it will last quite some time. It doesn't take much to soften the hair.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.\n",
      "21774->These are easy to use, but take long to put in | 4 | 0 | my hair is long.  It took a long time to get these put in.  The curls were great. These rollers would be great for someone who wants to sleep in them. I didn't find it worth it to use during the day.<br /><br />Good curlers with no heat.  I prefer my hot rollers.\n",
      "21775->Sadly underwhelmed with this oil, makes my face greasy | 3 | 0 | I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Age Defy Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with marula oil, rosehip oil, reishi mushroom, ginseng and cordyceps mushroom. This particular blend is supposed to help with wrinkles, acne scars and dry skin. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.\n",

      "21806->A hair turban  that actually works! | 4 | 0 | I adore these! They work perfectly,  soft,  absorbent,  plenty large (for long hair) and wash up nicely.<br />Two quick fixes and I'd give a 5 star review. First, the loop used to secure the twist needs to be more sturdy. Perhaps a rope loop, one of mine the loop has already broke, I had to sew on a replacement. Second,  I love them so much, I wish they had additional  colors available.\n",
      "21808->Everything you need in a mirror | 4 | 0 | I love this mirror. It turns on with a tap of your finger!<br />Very bright to see everything and great magnification ( could be a good thing or a bad thing, LOL).<br />The base separates from the mirror for easy flat storage or traveling.<br />USB chargeable so no cords.<br />Was a great deal.\n",
      "21810->not recommended, expensive | 2 | 0 | I wish this would work for me, but nope<br />It makes me smell really bad in just a few hours.<br />I used other nature line of nivea without aluminum in the past and it worked great plus way cheaper, but I can't find it anywhere now, so I tried this one and its totally not worth the money for me.<br />I still in the search for a good deodorant without aluminum\n",
      "21816->Lightweight and useful | 4 | 0 | I received 4 spray bottles, 2 pump bottles, 3 funnels, a bottle brush, and two sheets of labels in a large zip pouch. Everything came individually wrapped in a plastic sleeve, which is kind of wasteful.<br /><br />I found these easy to use. There were no issues with leaking. I liked that two pump bottles came with neck guards so they wouldn’t depress while being stored. The included labels stick well. I will say that the plastic of the bottles is a bit thinner than I’d expected; all of the other spray bottles I own are made of thicker plastic.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn’t see much use in having so many spray bottles but these days they’re pretty useful for filling with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol for the whole family. They’re also the right size for TSA fluid limits.\n",
      "21819->Not for impatient people | 3 | 0 | Couple things I’ve noticed with this curler.<br /><br />1. When I had long hair (halfway down back) it seemed to work better than when I cut my hair (shoulder length)<br /><br />2. If you have naturally curly/wavy hair (mine is curly on the bottom, wavy on top), it may not do anything for you<br /><br />3. Some strands may be uneven if you don’t curl it exactly the same each time<br /><br />4. The glove is a joke, don’t use it<br /><br />Now, maybe I just suck at using this product and can master it with practice, but I’m too discouraged with it right now to do anything. Maybe if you have someone else curl your hair for you it will work better? I don’t know.\n",
      "21826->Disappointing | 2 | 0 | I had high hopes for this body scrub. It’s priced high so I expected it to be high quality. I was disappointed as soon as I opened it, the product was separated. All of the thick gritty stuff was on one side and all of the liquid oily stuff was on the other side. I had to physically stir it up before I could even use it.<br /><br />The smell was overpowering. It wasn’t necessarily bad, just was too strong. I also thought the scrub was way too rough. I used it on my knees and it was border line painful. There is no way I could use this on sensitive skin areas like my stomach or chest. After rinsing off the grit in the bottom of the tub literally hurt my feet stepping on it.<br /><br />I also do not like how there is no ingredients list on the jar. I like to see what I’m scrubbing on my skin.<br /><br />Overall I do not recommend this body scrub.\n",
      "21828->Gorgeous hair- tangles | 4 | 0 | Crochets in nicely once you figure how to weave in that little bit that’s out and curly. Looks beautiful. I got so many compliments.<br />CAUTION: You must must must wrap it in satin at all times not out or while sleeping as the only drawback is this hair tangles. It detangles but with effort and care so you do not put too much strain on your edges.<br />That’s why I gave 4 stars.<br />I would not swim in this hair or hot tub or wash it.<br /><br />It’s so pretty though and with care can last.\n",

      "21847->Well built and compact | 5 | 0 | Well built and compact. The charger base works well.<br /><br />So far the 'waterproofness' has endured splashes, but don't dare try to dump it in a tub of water.<br /><br />The brushes work well and are replaceable. They should be available on Amazon.<br /><br />The case is a cool and shiny white patent leather.\n",
      "21855->Not all that great | 2 | 0 | My wife insisted on having this I told her I thought it was garbage. She insisted so I bought it for her as part of her anniversary . She used it twice put back original box.<br />She said she's going to re-gift it\n",
      "21884->Nice & mostly not plastic | 4 | 0 | It is really good to use a toothbrush that's mostly wood, rather than plastic.  Granted the bristles are still nylon (i.e. plastic), but they're a small fraction of the materials.<br /><br />It works nearly as good as a typical plastic toothbrush.  The only annoyance is that the shape of the neck - a rounded rectangle, in cross-section - seems to make it more susceptible to the toothpaste escaping your mouth.  Which can be overcome with a little care, but I wish they'd just round the neck more so that it isn't an issue.\n",
      "21896->Not all that effective but my boy loves it. | 5 | 0 | Pro:<br />My cat adores this thing. He bugs me to brush him with it every night. He tries to climb onto my nightstand to remind me.<br /><br />Con: it doesn’t hold a candle to the amount of hair I get off him using my Hartz Groomer's Best Small Slicker Brush. The hair’s also much harder to get out of the brush than with the Hartz one.\n",

      "21904->Dangerous - Waste of Money | 2 | 0 | This product worked fine for the first 4 to 5 uses. It's quite small. I didn't realize how small it was until I got it. After about a month of use hot steam started spraying from the spout onto my face and neck area. I had to shut it off immediately so I wouldn't continue to get burned. The unit now sprays hot steam regularly and I can no longer use it. Also, water leaks from the bottom even though the holes in the bottom are plugged. You could suffer severe injuries if you're not careful.<br /><br />I'm terribly disappointed in the quality of this product and would not recommend it to anyone. It was a complete waste of money and I'm irritated the return window has expired. I will have to dispose of it because it's useless.\n",
      "21915->Nice hair texture... | 4 | 0 | Purchased for my 9 yr. old niece as a Christmas present, she loves it.  I had mistakenly ordered two and had planned to return one, but my other niece (hairdresser) saw it and bought it from me.<br />.\n",
      "21920->Nice product, seems to work well | 4 | 0 | This is a nice serum by Easydew that comes in a dropper bottle. In it is a DW-EGF protein. It is basically a youth protein that helps your skin with collagen and elastin, basically helps your skin stay soft, smooth, and just look great.<br /><br />This serum is a light to medium consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any kind of residue on the skin, it is maybe a bit tacky at first but that goes away quickly. I am not prone to reactions to these kinds of products and didn't have any in this case either.<br /><br />I found this was a great moisturizer and my skin looked soft and smooth overall. This is a nice product and I am satisfied overall. It is also reasonably priced at just $30.\n",
      "21936->Dead as a doornail! | 2 | 0 | So, I haven't even had this two years, and the thing is dead. No amount of coaxing, touching, battery replacement, or cussing will make it turn on.<br /><br />I'm the only one who uses it, and the mirror itself detached from the stand, too! (It did not hit the floor. I caught it!)<br /><br />For the money, I should have gotten more out of this product. I'm very disappointed.\n",
      "21946->Why didn't they add another magnet, so you can trim them? | 3 | 0 | This was my first magnetic eyeliner and eyelash kit. The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara. They just need another magnet!\n",
      "21963->Do not buy! | 1 | 0 | This is the absolute weirdest ponytail ever the bang and the ponytail are two completely different colors and textures. I just do not get it. I didn't feel confident wearing it out without several hairpins. It just doesn't work for me. I hate I decided to try it after the return policy expired or it would've gone back! Wow. Unbelievable! I a<br />Complete waste of money.\n",
      "21969->Does nothing. A poor conditioner. False marketing claims. | 1 | 0 | An unremarkable conditioner. The name-brand conditioners work better and cost much less. This Foamiest product does nothing to thicken hair. It does not work well as a conditioner. None of the ingredients are associated with reducing hair loss. The three peptides in this product are<br />sh-Oligopeptide-1,<br />sh-Oligopeptide-2, and<br />sh-Polypeptide-3.<br />There are some peptides associated with hair health, such as GHK-Cu and TB-500, but this product does not contain those peptides. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that the ingredients in this product do anything for hair health. I searched online for any scientific studies and could not find anything, or even any theoretical benefits. I could also not find anything in the popular hair loss discussion forums. The manufacturer is making false and misleading claims to push their overpriced product. They are also making false claims about what caffeine does, such as saying that it suppresses DHT, which it does not do.\n",

      "22008->Makes the straightening process much quicker | 4 | 0 | I love how easy this flat iron hair brush is to use. It heats up very fast and gets super hot so do be careful. I have a natural wave to my hair and will use a flat iron to straighten my thick hair. It usually takes me about 15 minutes to get my hair done but with this new flat iron hair brush it only took me 9 minutes. Being a mother of three children, every minutes counts so I was delighted to cut an average of 6 minutes off of doing my hair. I should add that my hair was soft and shiny after straightening likely due to the built in Ionic generator. I also love that it has 5 heat settings allowing me to pick the one that works best for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Heats up very fast.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Power cord is 78&#34; long and rotates.<br />- Built in Ionic generator.<br />- 5 heat settings with LED display.<br />- Automatically turns off after 45 minutes making it safer to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's heavier than most flat irons.<br /><br />Overall, I really do love this flat iron hair brush. It works well and makes the hair straightening process much quicker.<br /><br />I received a discount in order to test the product. However, I post reviews so consumers can make informed decisions.

      "22012->Great accessory with my great Gatsby style dress | 4 | 0 | Great accessory with my great Gatsby style dress.  My head is small so I had no problems with the fit.  It is a metal and a bit heavy,<br />so I used four bobby pins to secure the ribbon ties.  I also put just a bit of moleskin on either side of the metal band where the ribbon is connected to cushion it against my head.  It's well made and sparkly.  I wore pearl earrings to match.\n",

      "22039->First run went great! | 4 | 0 | I plugged it in this morning and just now (about four hours later) I gave it a test run.<br />It kicked the butt out of my especially bad heel, I had such a large callus with a crack that it hurt to walk around (sometimes hurt while just sitting...) and it did it within a few minutes.<br />Normally I sit on the edge of the tub with my feet in there so I can rinse away the dead skin but I did this heel on my floor so I could get an “all this in a few minutes” picture for the review.<br />I just bought it so I’m not sure of downsides of faults yet really.<br />My one complaint (so far) is that you have to be somewhat strategic with how you hold it because the case back comes up kind of high on the roller, vs the one they have where you can access more of the roller.\n",
      "22053->Don't waste your money. | 1 | 0 | I opened it and took the brush out and it was broken off.<br />Tried to use a pair of tweezer to get it out, and expected a mess but there wasn't a mess, there wasn't even a small amount of black on the tweezers. So essentially I paid for an empty tube with a broken brush. Don't waste your money. I got a refund!<br />I give zero stars.\n",
      "22060->smells like citronella and the paper wrapper barely came off | 1 | 0 | something is wrong what the soap i received. It smells like citronella, not ivory soap.<br /><br />The soap must be so old or soiled that the paper wrapping wouldn't come off. The soap has a weird texture as if it was wet and then dried again.\n",
      "22098->Petals work great, but create wrinkles as you smooth them out | 4 | 0 | I love this dress but it IS sheer enough to see all the details. I was able to use the petals to successfully wear it - finally. I have those adhesive strapless bras, but those won't work for this kind of dress, obviously.<br />They are painless, but I suggest starting from the bottom and working upward to remove them.<br />The biggest issue for me was how the petals wrinkle up as I tried to smooth them out. I thought that the wrinkles would be visible but they weren't. And nobody could see through the dress. Depending on the lighting, you can see everything, so these help prevent that.<br />The petals stayed on for hours, and I couldn't even feel them, which I really liked.\n",
      "22099->Impressed with the quality of these brushes! | 4 | 0 | This is the first time I've tried this style of makeup brushes and I have to say I've been pretty pleased with the results.  I use one of the larger brushes to apply my foundation and find that it easily helps me to apply an even coat.  So much so that it appears that I'm not wearing foundation (as it should be).<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the smaller brushes and using them for things like eye makeup.  Personally, I did not find them to be as effective as the provided tool that came with the makeup.  Perhaps that is just me and I'm lacking the proper technique so far.  I am not giving up!  :)<br /><br />Overall, I love this set!  The color of the handles is shiny and attractive to me visually.  The bristles on the brushes is soft, yet they are packed so tightly that you get firm support from them.  Honestly, I was quite surprised at how firm they were (not prickly, just not bendy).  I use a light hand with them and I have had no issues thus far.  I've been using them for a couple months now and have yet to notice a single strand escaping.  I really feel like this set will last me for a long time to come and I plan on taking great care of them!  I feel that the price for this set is fair,  I have several different makeup brush sets ranging in price and I have to say that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Whether I get a product for free, at a discount or pay full retail price, I am 100% committed to my reviews reflecting my genuine thoughts. I appreciate you taking the time to read my review and hope that it was helpful with determining if this is the right product for you!\n",

Ships from un-authorized sources. | 1 | 0 | Overpriced, and un-authorized to be sold here on Amazon.<br /><br />You can save money and be assured of a genuine product, buying direct from Lush.<br />The product I have received had a Korean product label, missing the foil backed paper seal under the cap,<br />and had a flip cap, instead of a push-in style cap.<br />Caveat: For all I know, Lush may make a product to be sold in Korea with all of the above differences.<br />But, if I was aware of all these little differences, I would have never bought it.\n",
      "22142->Full & beautiful!! | 5 | 0 | This is a good quality full-looking scrunchie, I twist my long hair together, clip it to the top of my head, pull it up through the center & attach the scrunchie to the top of my head with small tortoise-shell clips (red-brown in hair color) on each side which can easily be concealed in the hair. It is comfortable & stays in place through a 12hr shift. Since I wear this on top of my head, it conceals my thinning hair in front & on top of my head. I blend it over my bangs in front. These are great for work & in hot weather to keep longer hair securely & comfortably off of your neck. I have also used larger plastic hairpins to also help comfortably secure these. I need larger scrunchies like this due to hair loss & a big head. It is not made to fit tightly over a ponytail.<br />I actually bought this color knowing it would not match my hair, which is a burgundy/brown shade, not too bright. I have been experimenting in coloring synthetic hair with Speedball acrylic ink & 70% alcohol in a spray bottle (see you-tube videos). I have successfully colored this to match my own hair color, which is difficult to match. By the way, I bought 2 other Katie colors: #33 &#34;auburn&#34; which is actually a dark brown shade with no red in it whatsoever, & #33/130 which is a dark brown blended with a light copper color. The 2nd was pretty, but just not the red shade I wanted.\n",
      "22149->It works for Me! | 4 | 0 | This thing has so many things to use that it’s pretty cool to me. It has Nail Clippers that I’ve never seen before but, I think they work really well to get in at angles that I just can’t do with regular ones. I wish the Case that comes with it could be hung up for storage but, I love all of the different tools in it and know that when I feel the next ingrown nail is coming, I will be able to get to it Much easier to avoid it from getting bad.<br />  I would definitely recommend it for the price it is.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁\n",
      "22152->VERY moisturizing; not the best bet for colored hair | 4 | 0 | I’ve used this for a week. It has a soothing, slightly minty scent. It lathers very well and seems to rinse clean. It makes hair feel very “clean,” if that makes sense. My one complaint with this shampoo (and the reason I won’t be using it to find out how long it can make my hair) is that it is VERY stripping. It will remove any hair color in your hair. I recently had heavy highlights put in my hair and toned it several times—this washed out the toner within one wash. So, while my hair was INCREDIBLY soft and I do feel this product improved volume—it is perhaps not the best option for colored hair (at least lighter shades).<br /><br />I gave it four stars, since it seems like a very nice shampoo that stimulates the scalp and moisturizes—however, I need to tone the grassiness in my hair, so I will be opting to use something that does not strip the toner/color quite as much.\n",
      "22160->Very tiny | 3 | 0 | This soap gets points for cuteness and the interesting bag that it arrived in. I also like that there are different colors to choose from. It does the job as a facial soap but it does it better using a soap bag because it is a little hard to get lather.<br /><br />I was not impressed with how it left my skin after washing my face. My skin feels dried out. It is also a very tiny soap for a pretty hefty price.\n",
      "22167->Very moisturizing | 5 | 0 | Please be aware that this is a very small bottle but you need just a tiny bit.<br /><br />The product is extremely moisturizing and goes on smooth. I am unable to comment on the long term effects because I just started using it.\n",
      "22176->Not for professionals | 2 | 0 | After receiving this product, it was immediately apparent that the items included were pretty cheap quality. I was thrown off by the word professional in the ad but trust me this is far from it. Although at a cheaper price, this product might be worth considering, anyone who is trying to  use this at a professional setting should look elsewhere.<br /><br />The shears look somewhat nice but they lack sharpness. The cape itself is extremely thin, nothing compared to the one I had before and this will definitely not be a replacement.<br /><br /> For the price, I do not think this product offers a very enticing offer. Overall this is a product I just cannot recommend because I do not see myself using it. Someone with slightly less experience with hair products might not be able to realize the lack of quality in this product so I warn you in advance. This product gets 2 out of 5 stars. This is just my take on the product and I hope this review helps you make an educated decision.\n",
      "22182->Good Product | 1 | 0 | Item arrived in a quick manner.<br /><br />However, the item was received with a damaged cap rendering the cover useless since it won't snap on anymore and dented bottom and top.<br /><br />It was wrapped tightly in a padded envelope.\n",
      "22197->Helps to detangle my wet hair in the shower but not as good as my Heeta brush | 3 | 0 | These brushes are actually like eight combs strung together. I had to set the extra piece that comes with each brush to separate the tines. It was not easy to get the bar across the \"combs\" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the \"brush.\" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no \"ball\" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one, the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle. Otherwise they work well. The current price of $8.99 is reasonable for two detanglers.\n",
      "22230->Love it. | 5 | 0 | Nice soap. I've used it as intended (rub on and face lather), and I've bowl lathered. It works well either way.<br /><br />I actually enjoy the scent. Performance is great. Sure, it dries my skin, but it's soap. Use some balm or moisturizer and off you go.<br /><br />It's too bad 1 stick is almost $5. Buying 3 gets you a much better deal, but i wouldn't buy 3 unless you already know you like it.\n",
      "22264->primer | 1 | 0 | I have bought this priner before. When I first starting using it, it was nice. It felt good; it came out of the pump thick and fluffy. The last bottle and the current bottle aren't the same. The primer comes out as a liquid under pressure so it shoots out. Most of the time, it misses my finger completely. I feel as though I'm just applying oil to my face.<br />I won't be purchasing this product anymore.\n",
      "22277->Did not work long-term | 3 | 0 | This deo works for me for about a week, but then I start to get a built-up stench. I'm not sure if the beeswax clogs my pores or what, but I have to do about a week using this then a few days off for the odor to disappear. I also started to get a rash after about 3 months of use, which wasn't great. I have stopped using it.<br /><br />I still gave it three stars because it did work for a while okay. It smells pretty good and is easy to use.\n",
      "22288->Try this, you'll love it | 5 | 0 | I love this. I made a body cream with essential oils<br /> I will most certainly buy again.\n",
      "22304->Its OK smh that's all!  Nothing more and nothing less! | 4 | 0 | When purchasing this brush I thought it was the one I had previously but it wasn't.<br />It's only ok, the brush isn't sturdy at all. The little suction they give you only stays put for so long.\n",
      "22348->Best from Jane Tran | 5 | 0 | Have purchased from this company before and super quality is expected for this price.<br /><br />This scrunchie is awesome. Stays taught, used daily for a month no stretching and no pulling hair out.<br />Happy to have this quality product!\n",
      "22351->Cheap and bad | 1 | 0 | They're cheap and you'll find out why if you buy.<br />These blades pull out your beard hair instead of cutting it.<br />Worst item I've ever purchased on Amazon.\n",
      "22364->These Work with the Original Razor Heads from the DSC! | 5 | 0 | I used to subscribe to the Dollar Shave Club but got tired of being gouged for razors so I cancelled my subscription. By this time I had quite a cache of razors so I didn't worry about needing more any time soon.  What I did not count on was that I would drop and break the handle.  I tried ordering a new DSC handle on Amazon only to learn that the DSC had moved to a different razor handle and blade so the new handle wouldn't work with my original blades.  Ugh!!<br /><br />I found this one and decided to take a chance.  YES!!  They work!  So feel confident that if you are in the same boat as I was, you've found one that works!\n",
      "22368->Don’t buy this set for the scissors | 2 | 0 | I didn’t buy this set for the scissors. Based on the cost of the set, I assumed the scissors would be very poor quality and I was right. Luckily I already have a good pair of scissors and I wanted the accessories. If you have never used good scissors, you may not know that these are poor quality and won’t do a good job on anyone’s hair.<br /><br />I was actually disappointed in the cape as I expected it to be a bit better than it is. It is poorly designed and doesn’t quite cover the entire area where hair would fall on your neck. The combs are OK and so are the clips. The case can be used to keep everything together as long as the zipper works.<br /><br />Overall: not something I can recommend\n",
      "22402->Multi Color eye/lip liners | 4 | 0 | The liner have a smell to them like they are old. I am not sure how to sharpen these pencils once I use what is there.<br />These are light colors but they do apply easy\n",
      "22405->Does NOT work and smells like a meth lab | 1 | 0 | First off, I sweat so bad that I don’t look like I’m wearing any makeup by the time I leave my home, and in the summertime, it feels like I’m sitting in a jacuzzi with my clothes on… So, it was really important for this stuff to work. Unfortunately, this antiperspirant smells like a combination of formaldehyde and a meth lab … and I know because I tried using this stuff on my face to treat excessive sweating (due to fibromyalgia), but it only kind of worked for a 1 or 2 days, but not in a row. So it’s not reliable. Plus, it leaves your skin dry and terribly itchy!<br />Which REALLY SUCKS, considering how expensive it is for such a small amount of “antiperspirant”.<br /><br />In short, I don’t recommend it.\n",
      "22408->Almost everything you ever wanted and less | 3 | 0 | It's a good mask, according to my wife and daughter. They both tried it and, after they did, there was enough left for maybe one application. Strangely, the tin came only half-full and I don't know if it was so only because it was from a batch sent to Vine reviewers.<br />The mask gets pretty dry after application but skin underneath stays Okay. Of course, it has all the right ingredients so, no surprises such as allergic reactions, swelling or redness. It's probably something that you would want to use once weekly but not more often.\n",
      "22410->Just spend a few bucks more.... | 2 | 0 | Does not last . Definitely not waterproof or sweatproof.<br />If deciding...just spend the extra few bucks and get the WonderBrow brand\n",
      "22488->Meh, not as good as the original I bought | 3 | 0 | I got the exact same product two years ago, and it worked great. I bought two more but now they’re iffy at best. They pick up hair OK, and then don’t clean very well when you slide them in and out of the holder.<br /><br />I find myself having to slide it in and out of the holder six or seven times to get most of the hair off, and even then 25% of the hair is still left on the fabric. Just… meh.\n",
      "22493->Decent but quickly fall apart | 3 | 0 | These are decent lashes for the price but do not last. They started falling apart after my second wear. Endless compliments when I did wear them though.<br />Pros: These lashes don’t require any trimming and are very natural.<br /> Cons: These lashes are super flimsy and began to fall apart after one wear! The lashes literally came off the band somehow. I’m very gentle with lashes! I dont think  I will be purchasing again. Drugstore brands are more durable and cheaper!\n",
      "22513->Heaven SCENT! | 5 | 0 | Smells heavenly! Once you use it a couple times, the ridges become soft and silky!<br />I want more!\n",
      "22530->Just my take | 3 | 0 | I have not ordered any other types of disposable headrest covers before. Therefor this may be considered \"extra soft\". To my face it seems lightly prickly. I will use them but I am disappointed. I do have sensitive skin not allergic to anything just sensitive. I wonder if something is wrong with me because of all the good reviews, I don't know maybe I am expecting to much.<br /><br />Goodluck,<br /><br />Matthew\n",
      "22556->NO ODOR. (did not work for me) | 2 | 0 | Immediately after opening, I tested the product on my hand (see photo) to see if I would have any type of allergic reaction, stinging, or irritation. After a few minutes, I did not notice any of those.<br /><br />PROS/<br />- NO ODOR! I've tried samples of similar products like this in the past and almost all that I have tried/smelled, all have some type of odor or scent. This product does not which is great!<br />- Packaging is really nice. It comes in a cute box- so if you're gifting, this would be extremely easy to wrap or put in a gift bag.<br />- Definitely giftable! Can totally see this being a great little gift to add to any gift bag or gift box. Would even make a great stocking stuffer this coming holiday season.<br />- Consistency of the liquid is nice- it is not thick, not slimy, not super thin, and not heavy.<br />- Easy to use. The brush is similar to most liquid eyeliner brushes so it is easy to apply on your brows and/or lash line.<br /><br />I have using this for a couple of days now. I have been consistent with it and plan to continue... I haven't quite used it long enough to see \"growth\" or any difference quite yet but I will totally update this when or if I do. Though, my brows and lashes have not fallen out so I guess that is a good thing, huh? I'm sold on the no odor!<br /><br />~UPDATE - 01/14/2020<br />It has now been 2+ months of continuous recommend use and I have NOT seen a difference in eyelash length/growth nor in eyebrows. I guess it is possible that everyone will get different results, but I did not get any. Changing my review from 5 stars to 2.\n",

Two days in and this serum has made me look older 😂😂, I’m laughing but it’s bizarre really.  The skin looks dryer and wrinkly (I don’t have either dry or wrinkly under eye skin) . It’s going in the trash!<br />What a waste of good money.<br />Btw, the after pic is the awful looking one on the right\n",

      "22637->Very nice eye shadow palette especially for this price | 5 | 0 | This is a very nice eye shadow palette. It comes with a total of 12 eye shadows, including 8 mattes with warm and cold tone browns and 4 shimmers, 2 warm and 2 cold tones there. I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion.\n",
      "22642->Gillette Fusion Proglide Limited Edition 1 Razor 2 Cartridges Kit | 4 | 0 | Over the years I have purchased my share of this company product, including their shaving gel. When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high. This package was a very nice deal and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it. I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.<br />In my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades. 4 Stars!\n",
      "22646->I like this product | 5 | 0 | This facial cream can be used in the morning and in the evening. Thankfully, the instructions for English are on the web site. DAY Care- Apply adequate amount on clean skin. Pat gently to absorb.<br />NIGHT Care (Recommended for 2-3 times per week)<br />- Apply on clean face and neck. Pat gently to absorb, then apply another layer. Leave overnight.<br />I love how this feels on my skin.\n",
      "22647->As a professional makeup artists I like to try lots of different skin products | 2 | 0 | As a professional makeup artists I like to try lots of different skin products!! I love mehron!! I use many of their products.  I gave this 2 stars because 1. It came earlier than expected. 2. It did dry out the oily spots it was applied to. BUT<br />IT WAS  VERY HARD TO BLEND MAKEUP OVER IT. It balled everything up.  Also I felt like it oxidized my makeup to a darker shade.<br />By mid day.. it had started to separate my makeup on the spots I had applied.. and if I tried to touch up.. nothing would adhere properly and looked caked in those areas.. I guess it wasn't for me OR my clients\n",
      "22648->It's ok | 3 | 0 | This has some pluses and minuses.<br /><br />The pluses:<br /><br />This doesn't irritate my skin and even if it doesn't do anything for bumpy skin, it does certainly make my skin very soft. I'm not entirely sure about its claims about dealing with skin issues like acne, as I'm a bit nervous to put this on my face. I figure that it could certainly be used for the occasional acne that shows up elsewhere (we all get it), as tea tree is well known for being a good way to treat acne. Still, I have heard that the base oil is good for skin as well, so that is a plus as well.<br /><br />The main minus I have here is that while the smell here isn't awful, it's still strong enough that it gave me a bit of a headache. (That's another reason I probably won't be using it on my face.) I was able to deal with this by putting it on in small bits, which seemed to work well since the strongest part of the smell faded away pretty quickly. The remaining scent is honestly pretty nice and mellow.<br /><br />I do have to commend the company for their packaging. While the bottle did leak during transport, the company was aware that this would happen ahead of time and packaged this well. I do wish that it didn't leak, but barring this I do appreciate that it was properly packaged so that the small amount of oil that leaked didn't get everywhere.\n",
      "22669->These don't pinch open wide enough. | 2 | 0 | These are OK, but with my arthritis, I find them hard to pinch open far enough to slide them onto my strip of hair.<br />Also, somehow, on their next upgrade, they should find a way to make them lighter in weight so they don't pull down from gravity.  However, I am older and my hair is thinner than it used to be.  Thicker hair would probably work just fine, especially if you have natural waves and good body to your hair.\n",

      "22701->Seems to work well | 4 | 0 | I purchased this brush for my 3 year old daughter after she kept seeing them on tv.  She asked me to order her one because based on the commercial there wouldn't be anymore fussing and hurting when we brushed her really long thick hair.  The color was very attractive to a child and makes it easy to find if you misplace your brush a lot like we do.  However the over all design is a little lightweight and bulky for my hands, I would like to see a better designed handle.  The use of the brush did cut down on the crying when we brush our hair drastically.  She's complains that it hurts some but not near as much.  Overall for the intended purpose of getting the tangles out without all the fussing I'd say it'd decreased the fussing / whining / crying by 75% since before we had it so for the price I paid I'd say it's worth it.<br /><br />*I paid full price for this product and the opinions stated are based on my use of it.\n",
      "22704->Gel brushex | 3 | 0 | 3 brushes broke I. Half on me the first time I used them, had to re-glue them.<br />The brushes are nice looking but the wood part of the handles gets nasty if you get acetone on them and the black finish will get on you.<br />I bought two sets of less expensive gel brushes with plastic handles and works way better.\n",
      "22726->I picked this up because it has the term \"Night Treatment\" in its name so it fit what I was looking for. | 4 | 0 | While I have a bit of discoloration around my cheek bones in two areas, they're not something I focus too much on when looking for a facial moisturizer. I've been on search for something to replace my Clinque Moisture Surge because while it works MOST of the time there are seasons my skin WON'T take it. I wanted something with a bit of a thicker consistency as well.<br /><br />I picked this up because it has the term &#34;Night Treatment&#34; in its name so it fit what I was looking for.<br /><br />I really liked the consistency of this product. The fact it also includes Vitamin C is a plus as well. My skin felt so refreshed and hydrated the next day (well like, three days later cause you know, it has to adjust and stuff). The only thing that I don't like is the scent, I felt like it was too strong for me. I tried applying less to see if it would lessen the scent and while it SORT OF did it also didn't. It's something I'm not really sure just yet I can live with or not. Which is sad because I like this product!\n",
      "22731->Dry oil with retinol | 4 | 0 | I've used retinol products, both OTC and prescribed by my dermatologist.  I've been careful to only use retinol at night and to avoid direct sunlight after using retinol.  This serum does not specifically warn against going under direct sun, but it is worth taking the precaution.<br /><br />I liked the texture of the Face Oil Retinol Serum - it feels like a dry oil and is easily absorbed into the skin. It doesn't feel oily or sticky but it moisturizes. It helps improve the firmness and tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and did not experience any redness, irritation, or sensitivity using this.\n",

I turned it upside down, since I noticed complaints from others, the 2 eyeshadow stayed secure. Note, I don't wear makeup daily or need to travel so It sits in a drawer, but it works for my light use.<br /><br />It has some writing on the front \"Phoera\" that was not mentioned when I ordered, also not pictured on the tab when I ordered. I just wanted it plain, that was the reason for 4 stars. Note, this did ship from China.\n",

Too much heat, too much cold, too much wind, too much dry air.<br />Those of us with sensitive skin know exactly what stressed out skin is. We need something that will soothe, without any irritation.<br />This particular cream hit that goal for me. I used it during a rosacea flare up, to help the redness and discomfort calm down. It worked very well. Not a miracle, but it worked well.<br />If you have skin like mine, I hope it works for you.\n",
      "22801->Product Name is Misleading | 2 | 0 | I read all the glowing reviews and decided to purchase this product, and decided to use it daily for a month before writing this review.  If you are considering purchasing this product be advised that Vi-Tae will send you emails encouraging you to post a review (hence, this one for my purchase -- but not the positive rating they were soliciting), and offer you incentives for good reviews -- Amazon promo codes for discounts on other Vi-Tae products.  I did not go to their website to fill out the form to get discounts, nor did I register for their $250 sweepstakes.<br /><br />The name of this product is &#34;More Than Clean:  Blackhead Remover, Pore Minimizer & Unclogger;&#34; It is a misnomer to call it a &#34;blackhead remover&#34; since it does not remove blackheads; I doubt there is a product out there that does.<br /><br />Perhaps it does minimize and unclog pores, but I am rating it two-stars for two reasons:  (1) because of the &#34;blackhead remover&#34; claim, which was the reason for my purchase; and (2) the Amazon price of the product, 4.46 oz for $39.95 (list price $69.50).\n",
      "22830->Nothing to get excited about here | 3 | 0 | This is just a pretty plastic toothpick.<br />Not worth the price being asked.<br />No warranty if it breaks, and it possibly will do that.<br />Just keep looking for something worth your money because this isn't in my opinion.\n",

      "22868->Simple headbands that loosely grip my head;wish there were more color variety | 4 | 0 | There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.\n",
      "22898->No Norelco, I still prefer my 550 TL | 3 | 0 | I bought a Norelco 550 TL about 17 years ago and I still have it. I like the way the Floating Heads give a close shave, and the way the pop-up sideburn trimmer works crisply and efficiently. It cleans easily and is compact. I think I spent a $25 on my 550 TL brand new.<br /><br />When I had the chance to try the Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, I looked forward to putting this Norelco newbie through its paces.<br /><br />But I was very disappointed.<br /><br />THe VERY first thing I DID NOT like (ZERO stars for this!!) was the plastic \"Clamshell Packaging\" -- which is a waste of plastic and time. IF Norelco had decided to incorporate a Travel Case into this Clamshell packaging with re-usable features, then I would have been content. But as it was, this was just a waste of plastic. Clamshell packages have sent numerous folks to the hospital with some nasty cuts inflicted while trying to open this sealed, thick plastic, stubborn packaging. Then again, it is a waste of plastics made even more wasteful when you consider the price of petroleum nowadays, and the inability to recycle this type of plastic. I suppose someone who wants to, can, with a little ingenuity and transparent mailing tape, take this Clamshell Package and create a travel container for their 8040x-- which might be a good idea, because the fabric travel pouch that Norelco supplies with this shaver only holds the shaver, and not the accessories -- unless you want to cram everything into the travel case and NOT close it.<br /><br />Well.... now -- about the shaver itself. The instruction book is very thorough -- but the warnings interspersed throughout are in grey print -- how about bold black?<br /><br />The shaver itself is nothing I would want to use all the time -- in fact, after trying it, I still prefer my 550 TL. The heads on the 8040X DO flex, but the moisturizing cream/gel only comes through two of them when all three heads with moisturizer would work much better -- the heads also drag across my skin -- and in some instances gave me a bit of razor burn -- especially on my neck. This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have been.<br /><br />Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full. Um.........<br /><br />This Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it's gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning. The Norelco 8040X IMHO probably work just as well on dry skin as on wet -- but it's nothing I would want to use on a regular basis.\n",

      "22950->Eats batteries! | 2 | 0 | Save money in the long run by buying a model with a charger.My husband and I have had these brushes for about a year and a half and are down to replacing the batteries about once a week.<br />Mine died within a couple months of use. It would just keep shutting off during use even though the batteries were new. I called Sonicare, they had me take it apart and clean the contacts with rubbing alcohol, that didn't help, so they sent a replacement. The new one started doing the same thing within a few weeks, called again, again they sent a replacement. Their customer service is actually pretty good and they stand behind their products, but it gets old replacing batteries and replacing brushes.<br />Overall, I like the performance of the brush, it does a great job, and my teeth really do feel much cleaner.<br />I just ordered a set of two with chargers from Amazon, they are more initially but I know we will save money in the long run by not having to use 4 AA batteries every week.\n",

      "22970->Incredible hair serum - just everything right about it | 5 | 0 | This is a fantastic Leave-in hair serum. It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it. You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can’t say enough good things about this!\n",
      "22971->Works but painful! | 4 | 0 | I started using this a few weeks ago.  At first it wasn't painful hardly at all.  And it's true, after 3 days I was definitely noticing a difference and was very pleased.  But the last time I put them on it was so painful I had to take them off after 10 minutes.  I plan to go back to them again but am a little leary of the pain right now. However, my teeth are sensitive so this might not be the case for everyone.<br />Overall, very happy with the difference it has made in the color of my teeth....just wish it was less painful.\n",

      "23024->Fit me well even though I am  plus size with a large head. | 5 | 0 | This ShungHO Hairband Cap Woolen Braiding Knitted Headband is much better quality than I was even expecting. It came in just a clear plastic cover. The braiding and knit of the yarn is very nice, with no frayed or loose hanging ends that I could see. The braiding looks super cute, and would go well with some braided boot socks. It does feel like wool, so it is a bit scratchy but not uncomfortably so. It was thicker than I expected it to be and keeps your head nice and warm. I did notice it seems to ride up on the back of my head a bit which I do not like, but that is no problem of the product, just the nature of the design. It looks a bit strange with your hair down but looks pretty cute with it up in a messy bun. I think I would have liked it a bit more if it was a bit less wide, because it covers so much that it looks a bit strange. I do however, like the fact that it covers pretty much half of my ears as well, to keep them nice and cozy during cold evenings and frosty mornings. Quality product.<br /><br />~Thanx~\n",

I was able to get these at a discounted sale price and quite pleased with them. I got the blue colored ones. You get 12 of them in a nice tidy box. The caps snap on easily but do not pop off-they stay on! They twist up nicely too. They seem to made very good-way better than some solid white ones I bought at my local craft store. When I used those, the warm/hot mix seemed to make them feel flimsy. These right off the bat are a thicker feel. Plus I think they will look much nicer. The translucent body will show off my balm! They are a standard 5.5mL size like most lip balms sold commercially. Like I said I am very pleased with my purchase!<br />Even though I got these at a discounted price, I am under NO obligation to leave a review. I am leaving my review based on my honest opinion of the product. Once I use these up, I will get more. For 12 of these, the price is cheaper than the ones I got at my local big name craft store!\n",

But there were 2 huge problems with these:<br />(1) I don’t have freakishly large thumbs or anything, but the largest size didn’t come close to fitting my thumbnail. It also seemed much shorter than the other nails in the set.<br />(2) The little connecting post to each nail left a little burr, which I gently filed off, but the filed area is now white, not the solid color of the rest of the nail.<br />I’ll probably keep them, because they were cheap and I like the colors, but I’ll have to buy another brand to use on my thumbs.

      "23145->Nifty idea but I'd worry about it holding mask in place | 2 | 0 | What's that saying about necessity being the mother of invention? Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material. A sort of light grey merle, but if you are looking at this for long-term safety, I would say no.\n",

If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\n",
      "23192->Favorite face wash | 5 | 0 | I am quickly becoming a fan of products from EasyDew. This cleanser comes in a very nice pump dispenser. When you use it you will first notice that it has a lotion like consistency which is unusual for cleansers. Next you will notice the incredible fragrance it has that I absolutely love, especially for facial products fragrances are very important to me and this one is fantastic.<br /><br />This cleanser is super gentle I found. After I am done my skin feels soft and smooth and not dried out at all. It actually feels almost like I moisturized it. I do still follow up with a moisturizer but you could do without one if you were in a rush.\n",

      "23239->They look good | 2 | 0 | The nails look good, the colors, the shape, the material, very very nice.<br />However, I was not able to fit most of them, too narrow or too wide, not enough sizes.<br />Yeah, I could file them and shape them, but that defeats the purpose.<br />So unfortunately I will be returning them.\n",
      "23240->7 bottles but 6 spray heads. | 2 | 0 | Why forget one of the spray head??<br />The plastic bottle is thin as regular plastic water bottle.<br />can't believe I paid $14 for these. I'd go to dollar store and buy 14 of spray bottles.\n",
      "23256->Ineffective and Disappointing | 2 | 0 | I have heard so many good things about Real Techniques products, but I'd never had the chance to try any of them. When this product became available to me, I jumped at the opportunity to finally see what all the fuss was about. After using it and reading reviews, all I can say is thank goodness this sponge evidently isn't indicative of the line's overall quality, because I found it to be pretty terrible.<br /><br />The packaging says it can be used wet or damp, and in all honesty, neither of those ways worked for me. I tried using the flat top and it basically didn't do anything. I then tried using some of the side facets, and those were a little better but not by much. When dry, it took a fair amount of time and effort just to get it to blend or even to just apply and spread products. When damp, it moved the product around somewhat, but what it primarily did was absorb foundation and concealer. As for using the tip around the eye area, it was almost totally ineffective for me when it was dry; when damp, it felt almost too flimsy and squishy to do anything. Ultimately on both occasions, I had to put the sponge aside and just use my fingers or a super cheap wedge sponge from the drugstore to finish blending everything - both methods worked exceedingly better than this sponge, by the way.<br /><br />The one thing I appreciate about the sponge is that it's latex free, which is good for people like me who are allergic to seemingly everything. Other than that, this product - at least for me - was a fail (and a ridiculously overpriced one, at that). I'm still eager to try other Real Techniques products, but this is one for which I won't be reaching again.\n",
      "23281->Not sure what their definition of fragrance free is... | 2 | 0 | Based on 1000+ reviews I was shocked at the quality of this product. it was sticky and defiantly not fragrance free.<br /><br />They did let me return it with free shipping so I give them that.\n",

      "23301->My new favorite brand for wipes | 5 | 0 | These wipes are excellent. They are thick enough as well as large enough to do the trick. You can tell they have alcohol in them because for the smell. However, it dissipates quickly. The wipes are wet enough but not too wet. The best part is the flap to open and close them. There is a security seal to remove the first time you use one. After that, you just pull open the flap and snap it closed when finished. You don’t have to rub a seal to make sure it is securely closed.<br /><br />Just like the other Germ Shark products that I have tried, this one is a winner.\n",
      "23339->Unbeatable | 4 | 0 | This whole brand is great.<br />This specific product works very well for several types of black & mixed hair\n",
      "23347->All natural Luxury | 5 | 0 | I have never used a bath bomb, mostly I have used bath salts and made my own bath treatments, but had heard so much about bath bombs that I wanted to try them out for myself. I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I HAVE TRIED THIS AND EVALUATED IT ACCORDINGLY\n",
      "23364->Solid Product When Traveling | 4 | 0 | This product is great when you have a long trip and you're in economy class or if you want to be more clean when you're at your seat.<br /><br />Quality:<br />All the products in this pouch are pretty decent quality. My favorite is the eye mask, it's nice and soft. Something that I wish the product had though was lotion. It gets really dry on the airplane so it is very nice to have a moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad product and I would recommend.\n",
      "23369->Sooth your skin while repelling bugs | 5 | 0 | I have used Avon skin so soft for ages as an insect repellent & have come to enjoy the aroma as well as how good it makes my skin feel.<br /><br />It was more expensive than I expected but a little goes a long way.\n",
      "23370->***Product Warning*** | 3 | 0 | I purchased the product from Amazon.com directly so I received 12 packs of 60 Bobby Pins. Some of the other dealers here sell under the same title, but do not send 12 packs. You will notice their prices are must lower than amazon's price. I got my 12 packs for ~$9 with free shipping. However, other sellers are selling single packs and such under the same title for ~$2 for ~$2 shipping. Seems like a better deal, until you get it in the mail and it is not a 12 pack.<br />As far as the product goes, all bobby pins are cheaply made. These bobby pins are no different. Now that my wife has 720 of them for under $10, we will not have to worry about them for along time. Other than that I constantly find them on the floor.<br />I would give the product and price 5 stars, but until Amazon fixes the other seller of this item, I will give it 3 stars for its scam qualities.\n",
      "23372->Easy enough to use – no bubbles without heat, though – Gets HOT! | 4 | 0 | This thing is pretty nifty.  I do feel that the machine gets hot super-fast – like super-fast.  And I never have to turn it higher than low for the heat – it is that hot.  Can not imagine using it hotter actually. At least I can turn it off if I feel it is getting to hot for me.  But that is where the one missing function is really glaring.  You can not use this thing with just bubbles.  Now at first that doesn’t sound bad at all.  That is until you feel how hot the water can get.  You only get just heat alone or heat and bubbles – again – no JUST bubbles…<br /><br />Being collapsible makes it easy to put away and store.  The remote control is easy enough to use but tends to fall off when you store this – so just be sure not to misplace it.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : )\n",
      "23374->Not a Close, Comfortable Shave for Me | 3 | 0 | There are some nice features in this new shaver, but, alas, in its primary function, this wireless shaver falls short.<br /><br />First, what I liked: the charging cable can connect to USB, which greatly impressed me; the ease with which I could clean the shaver after each use; the pop-up trimmer.<br /><br />Second, what I found wanting: the cut! It tended to pull some hairs and failed to easily cut close to the skin. Worse still, my face was stinging as if I had splashed it with aftershave.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Three stars out of five.\n",
      "23395->GLOW recipe for brightening, repairing, hydrating. Decent wipe for hands, feet, wherever | 4 | 0 | This is a package of 15 individually packaged biodegradable wipes. All of their products come in 15, 30, or 45. This 15 pack at $8.95 makes them $0.59 each. Easy to open, all tucked into a flip top box<br /><br /> Excellent for on the go, for travel, for whenever. I have used a variety of Busy Co wipes, and I have liked them all, some more than others. When I selected this, I chose it after taking a look at the ingredients (how I always select items to buy or to try). So it was weird not to see direct ingredient list on this product page. I have included the ingredients here:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice<br /><br />This unscented GLOW formula is aimed toward those seeking to BRIGHTEN SKIN, IMPROVE DRY SKIN, and REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN.<br />Not sure who is trying to use this on babies, but this product is not marketed for that use.<br /><br />I use this on my hands and feet, prior to bed. Then I add my lotions. The wipe does a good job cleaning my skin and nails. Adds little hydration. Could use them being a little more damp, but they do work. I have a couple tucked into my purse in case I just need a wipe, but for the most part I am keeping these for night time use. While I think this product is ok, it isnt a must have for me, and I likely wont repurchase. But I do like other Busy Co products, and have found that they are a better fit for my needs (and have been repurchases).\n",

I feel like Cleopatra and will certainly repurchase.<br /><br />Imperceptible highlights are hard to find, in this day and age of blinding \"instagram skin\" which detracts from the beauty within.<br /><br />Becca should keep this as a permanent fixture, nevertheless I'd like to thank the lovely seller for so generously shipping this gem. A cherished and true asset.♡ X.\n",
      "23445->Don't know if I got a bad batch or is normally like this | 1 | 0 | The color itself is nice. It's a reddish pink-like a muted coral. The problem is that there is practically no product. It feels very dried out. I have to keep flipping the sponge after each use to get the product onto the cushion. And I have to really push into the sponge to get something. This is not normal.<br /><br />The coverage (from what I can get) is very sheer. Honestly, this could be because I got a bad batch-I don't really know. Because of this, I will not buy this product again. All the other Vely Vely products that I have are amazing-this one just seems like a dud.<br /><br />I ended up buying a 3CE blush cushion in coral and it's 1000% better than this cushion (and larger-this one is tiny) so that may be your best bet.\n",
      "23460->Too much hassle to remove. No joke! | 2 | 0 | Next to imposible to remove. I use 100% pure Acetone and it took 20 minutes to get this stuff off my nails and it still left some behind.<br />I like the concept, but not worth the hassle. I used it once and now I don't want to use any of the other colors because of what a hassle it was to get it off.\n",

It happened the whole day, not for a couple of hours. Makes it slightly uncomfortable to talk.<br />Color pay off is amazing but by the 6th hour my lips were chapped and flaking very badly. I took it off and it left a stain.<br />Overall you get a lot of lipsticks for the price of one at sephora\n",

The shampoo isn't very foamy and the conditioner needs more \"slip\" My hair felt a teeny bit fuller when dry, but nothing significant.

Pilot light indicates when fully charge.<br />- Cutting head can be raised or lowered to suit closeness of shave.<br />- Interchangeable shave head for close work.<br />- Whisker catch compartment is easily cleaned with enclosed brush.<br />- Vacuum system draws in cuttings to minimize clean-up.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None:\n",

      "23612->Pretty and very glittery | 5 | 0 | This is very glittery powder, it is nice for me as an eyeshadow, or very minimal highlights. Fallout as an eyeshadow isn't bad.<br />I got it for my daughter for special events, as a 5 year-old can pull off wearing glitter much better than a 32 year-old. She always wants to wear my make-up when I get ready for special events, so this is her own make-up! I love that the powder and puff came sealed with plastic, preventing the powder from getting everywhere, and letting me know that the product is brand new.\n",

Everything you need for a manicure or a pedicure.<br /><br />I really held off getting a new set and wound up with bald sponges and nail files that were sooo smoothed out they were useless.  FINALLY, I can file my nails again.<br /><br />This set contains everything you need sans clippers.<br /><br />Recommended.\n",

      "23633->Love the glitter | 4 | 0 | This gel polish has a nice collection of glitter gels. They are shiny and sparkly. I worked with mine while they were at room temperature and did not have any trouble with thickness. I found them to be easy to apply and to cure quickly. I do wish that they had come with a base and a top coat.<br /><br />While there is no colored label on the bottles, they do provide a set of stickers to make your own.\n",
      "23638->Okay Quality | 3 | 0 | The sprayer on one of the bottles came apart in my hand when I pulled out the safety tab. I was able to fix this, but it has been fiddly ever since and needs to be held to really work properly. In addition, the spray just doesn't activate sometimes when I pull the trigger for this one. Not sure what the issue is with this, but it happens maybe 5% of the time. The other bottle works great and hasn't had any issues so far.<br />I do like that the down tube in the bottle is nice and long so you'll get to use up all the product you put in the bottle. It's always annoying when you can't get the remaining product out of a bottle because the tube doesn't make contact with the bottom of the bottle. The mist delivered is wide and consistent when it does spray and is great for hair or plants.\n",
      "23678->Not for me | 3 | 0 | I ordered this to use for travel.  My hair is short, should length or shorter and not very thick.  Iron was ok, felt like a toy though and could only use for a few strands to touch up my curls.  I would not be able to use for full head.  Due to its size, it was difficult to get full strand of hair around iron.<br /><br />If you have longer or thicker hair, I do not recommend.\n",
      "23680->Delivers Results I Rarely See w/Other Like Products | 5 | 0 | While XXI Bio-Pure facial moisturizer is packed with great skin care ingredients such as jojoba, shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower seed oil and glycerin, I think its the Vitamin C that really makes this an exceptional product.  At least for my skin it's exceptional.<br /><br />This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn't cause skin to look/feel oily or greasy.  It softens and smooths skin. Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed.  And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow.  I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.\n",

This is harder to use than I expected after watching a zillion YouTube videos and already using the cloth headband method.  It is not something one should expect to master after only one or two tries.<br /><br />I'm wondering what is up with 35% 5 Star reviews that when clicked says, \"No such reviews to show.\"?<br /><br />Currently, using a cloth headband is working great for me, but I'm not ready to give up trying to use this just yet.\n",

The rubber mask stayed on thicker and were easier to peel off than some of the ones I'd used previously.  The feel and texture of these masks light, cold and rubbery. Once I remove the masks, my skin doesn't feel sticky at all.  The masks hydrate and are light on the skin.\n",

Brush bristles felt nice on my skin. Too bad it’s garbage though.\n",

It's from China for one.. and I'm certain with how amazing it is some woman deep in the forbidden city hand crafted this with a lost gōng fū. Seriously, my family loves it and our daughter looks adorable!<br /><br />My only regret is that we didn't order two.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? The shipping seriously takes FOREVER. At least they warn you when you order it.\n",

I immediatelly felt like my fingers were in sausage casings they were so tight.<br />Pros: they're really cute looking and are waterproof<br />Cons: one size does not fit all, they broke after 3 uses.<br />The latex purple part ripped right off the star frilly part.<br />I guess I'll just stick to old yellow latex gloves!!<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, cheaply made!!\n",
      "23859->Excellent keychain carriers; 2 spray bottles dispense fine mist; flip top ones only okay – 4.5 stars | 5 | 0 | I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the tie-dye colors are vibrant and attractive. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and what feels like neoprene carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. In addition, I can put in a chapstick, nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is very reasonable for this set.\n",
      "23876->Helps remove more tartar build up than a standard tooth brush | 4 | 0 | Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner, and the vibration is enjoyable as well.<br /><br />The battery life is great, however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.<br /><br />The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.<br /><br />As far as replacement heads, I went with the [[ASIN:B004LZCY6S Generic Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.)]]. They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.<br /><br />Highly recommend this powered tooth brush.\n",
      "23880->Very Small, Great for Travel | 4 | 0 | These are very small towelettes that come in a small sealed packet. It's perfect for travel given its small size but I needed at least 2 towelettes to wipe down my entire face. That means it will be used up very quickly so the value is average. The towelettes aren't particularly strong either - I tore one just pulling it out of the package. There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs. As a result, this bundle of towelettes has limited usefulness - it's good for a light face cleaning or to finish the job left by a facial cleanser.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's paraben free and has no scent to irritate my allergies. Overall it's good but not great.\n",
      "23888->Love these-not so much any more | 2 | 0 | When they arrived I didn't think they would catch sweat but been riding in 90+ degree weather with 70% humidity and they did just fine they are so cute and comfortable I just wear them around the house too<br /><br />Update November 2015<br />I found that in washing them whether by hand or in the washer they twist and the horizontal seam gets all wonky and shows and you can't straighten them back out -I am  really bummed out because this turns them into a waste of money- bad design that could probably easily be fixed with some more stitching down the vertical seam to tack it all in place\n",
      "23892->It Works fine. I guess it does the job | 3 | 0 | It Works fine. I guess it does the job, Its not water proof though. Which is odd considering you use water<br />to wash your face.\n",
      "23895->So Cute & Pretty | 4 | 0 | I like both pinks and the silver mostly of the colors it comes with. The nails are a nice long length and are pretty thick so no need to worry too much about it bending and breaking while you wear them. The nails are kind of skinny though which is one of the things that I don't like too much. The adhesive it comes with is just ok and sticks for a little while, just make sure you don't get any kind of liquid on your nails. In short they wont stay on long after you wash your hands.<br /><br />I would recommend these nails if your looking for a short term fix and just want cute nails for a few days.\n",
      "23902->As advertised | 5 | 0 | The product delivers. It's a nice hyaluronic serum.<br /><br />Value for money. Better than expected.\n",
      "23933->Cheap Quality | 2 | 0 | I ordered two lots of these. Unlike the other reviewers I didn't get a lot of duplicates- even when buying two lots. There were a few but the majority were different. I would like to point out (though I am seeing this AFTER purchasing) the seller has listed under product description: “please note, random colors does not mean different colors, it means you will get either one color or different colors. “ So buyers just be aware, I might not have ordered if I saw that first.<br /><br />Quality wise, I mean for the price and they amount you're getting you can't expect high quality. Be aware they are not made 316L Surgical Steel. If you're sensitive to metal, I'd stay away. They are externally threaded which I wouldn't recommend if your piercing is new. Internally threaded will cause less irritation. The dome shaped head can cause some irritation as well. I have found it really just depends on the ring. I've used several of them and about ¾ of them are fine but that ¼ for some reason, the dome just scratches the roof of my mouth.<br /><br />I also want to warn buyers the pictures shown, don't really give a good representation of what is sent. Here's an example of the ones I received: Slut, Bitch, Cum Here, Zebra Print, American Flag, Smiley Face, Winking Smiley Face, Chanel Logo, Playboy Bunny Logo, Rolling Stones Logo, Party Girl, XXX, 90% Bitch, Yoga Ohm, Bad Girl, Evil inside, Snake Eyes, Che Guevara, Lucky Cherries, etc.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying these because it's really a gamble on what you're going to get and the quality isn't that great.\n",
      "23944->Just ok | 3 | 0 | This is just ok for me. It gets out tangles but that is about all. It left my hair soft but did nothing for frizz.<br />It's decently priced and the scent is great.\n",

      "23961->too much for me | 2 | 0 | 1st, they come without the glue, so I had to buy that separately<br />2nd, they are too much for me. I wanted some enhancement but nice and discreet, so I thought these will give a range of sizes/dimensions. the smallest are way to big and too long. Trimming them makes them even more unnatural.\n",

      "23975->One coaters but they're just ok. | 3 | 0 | I like the colors however they don't like to dry.<br />Update. They work ok as long as I don't use the keratine  3day grow base and top I was using. They won't harden and stay taky with that one but they will dry ok ish with an essie base and top. They dry super slow either way though but at least they eventually harden for me with the essie top/base combo. I'm not a fan of dents in my polish especialy if I'm waiting over an hour before doing anything to avoid it.<br /><br />I will try other top and base combos to see if anything works better with them. And update again. I do rather like that the polishes are mostly one coaters however.<br /><br />Update: They work well as stamping polishes.\n",
      "23990->The hair is not the same in the picture | 1 | 0 | The hair is clearly not the same as in the picture. There is nothing Kinky about this hair at all. Its silky hair, and its clearly not human. I paid for 20 inches--this hair didnt even come down to my neck.<br />The pieces were very small-- had to use about 2 or 3 pieces even for each linen of my head. Then it didnnt even cover half of head.. so there was not enough hair. I feel like If the product would have outlined how short the pieces were, I would have bought more hair, but Im glad I didnt.<br />I usually dont leave reviews-- but hopefully this helps somebody-- I for sure wish I had known this before buying-- Im returning the hair. I wouldnt recommend buying this if you're looking for Kinky hair.\n",
      "23991->Best Peeling Kit I've Tried So Far | 4 | 0 | This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.\n",
      "23995->Good quality, but doesn't hold up well with use. | 2 | 0 | First off, this protector was the easiest one I've ever installed.  Their suggestion to apply it in a steamy bathroom was genius and I will try that trick for all my future screen protector applications.<br />Sadly, that's the only good thing I can say about this item.<br />First off, when applied correctly there are 2 glare lines that run down the apex of the curves of the phone from top to bottom.  Although this didn't appear to inhibit the function of the phone itself, it was very distracting when I was looking at anything with a light background.<br />Secondly, the screen attracts fingerprints worse than any screen protector I have EVER had, with any phone.  My screen was constantly dirty and needed to be cleaned.<br />Thirdly, my OnePlus 8 Pro has the fingerprint reader in the screen on the front.  After using this screen protector for less than 30 days, a multi-colored aura started to appear in the area of the fingerprint reader.  Don't understand why, but it caused a slight distortion in that area of the screen that could be distracting.<br />Lastly, when the screen protector was first installed there didn't appear to be any issues with my fingerprint reader, but over the course of time I started to notice that I had to try multiple angles and press harder and harder to get the reader to work through the protector.  This is very irritating when you're busy and need to answer a call or check something quickly when your busy.  With only a few weeks of use this became more and more of an irritant.<br />Conclusion, although the quality of the screen protector itself seems to be good, the functionality and execution of the product leaves much to be desired.  If none of these things are issues for you, than the protector itself is okay.  I actually dropped it twice and it held up really well.  Especially when I dropped it face down in the gravel in a parking lot and I noticed it landed right on. Acorner of the glass but didn't break or crack.  I thought that was impressive.\n",
      "24004->It does a better job than brushing with regular tooth brush. | 4 | 0 | Although I never had good experiences with Philips' products, and with other electric toothbrush brand like Braun oral B, and recently I found 20 bucks on the ground , so I don't really care if it does not last long, after reading some bad reviews that water gets inside the battery compartment, which I see is happening, but still I'm sure I'll find the way around it after the 2 years warranty expires.<br /><br />Now, for the intended job, cleaning your teeth, is much better than the moving action from Oral B Braun, the 2 minutes limit bothered me a bit, but it takes seconds to turn on again and back to the job. And I do feel my teeth more slippery after using it.<br /><br />The included batteries lasted for 3 weeks and the unit won't operate as powerful as with a new fresh set of batteries, this thing is really powerful. So , don't judge the unit's power with the batteries supplied.<br /><br />The handle is one of the reason I took one star off, it becomes very slippery and when you need to turn around the toothbrush you need to use both hand, so it does not fall from my hand, unless you are not like me, that I realized that I use my other hand to lean on the sink, probably won't find it awkward, but otherwise is not big deal.<br /><br />If it fail, I will update this review and let you know how not surprised I was.\n",
      "24005->Keeping the product but would have liked to have the colors | 3 | 0 | Product performed well - colors shown are not accurate for what was sent. Two of the colors were the same. Keeping the product but would have liked to have the colors<br />advertised\n",
      "24007->Closing the lid | 1 | 0 | How do you close the lid????  I fight with closing the lid as it will not twist and turn to close lid and when it finally does click into place, you can not open it!!<br />How do you contact the company??????????\n",
      "24018->Battery Operated! Fun but limited! | 4 | 0 | I honestly didn’t know this I battery operated when I requested this through Vine, have I known that I will not get it. The product is good and is fun to use with my niece when I have them with me.<br />The foot spa is easy to operate and makes your little girl feel extra special.<br />The items that comes with it is cute BUT the slippers are super thin/flimsy and slippery so be very careful if you plan to use them around wet areas/tile floors.<br />This uses a battery and will cost you more than the unit over time, if you use the rechargeable kind then you may not be able to use it longer (spa time wise)<br />Overall the product is good and exactly as described!\n",
      "24033->Not real looking at all! | 2 | 0 | 1st off the hair color is really nice. it's a nice ombre effect with burgandy roots.<br />The wig is really long but looks fine after cutting. The hooks to tighten loosen and come unhooked so that is really annoying. The front has a nice amount of hair but the back is very thin. Only enough to cover your real hair and net from showing. The front part looks natural but not at the part. I have to get a small amount of hair and cross it over just so it doesn't look that bad. Yes it does she'd but that seems to be the least of the issue. My next wig will be a lace front and I hope it's not cheaply made. Buy this wig if you plan to wear a hat with it. hope this helps\n",
      "24053->Very disappointed | 1 | 0 | I should have realized that since this product is from a foreign country the eyebrow guides are tiny.<br />If you like small eyebrows this is perfect for you.<br />The guides should have been a mixture of larger size and smaller size eyebrow stamp guides.<br />The stamp works ok. It is not waterproof and smeared when I tried to clean up the lines on my eyebrows. I’m very disappointed with this brand.\n",
      "24079->No instructions & a waste of time! :-( | 2 | 0 | Have no clue how to use the product. Came with no instructions. No manufacturer listed on bottle, so I cannot look for website. Kind of useless right now.<br />UPDATE: Tried to use the product. Painted it on and let it dry for 2 minutes. Painted my nails. Tried to peel the Peel Off Tape product - no luck. Had to use 100% acetone to remove the Peel Off Tape and the polish I just painted on.<br />Do not purchase this product. It's a waste of money and time!\n",
      "24113->Has everything you need for skincare routine | 4 | 0 | This set pretty much has everything you need for a night time skin care routine. There’s a cleanser, toner, face cream, eye cream, etc. The packaging is beautiful and for some of the items, heavy (glass). There is a light scent but it is nothing overwhelming or offensive. The amount of product is also quite generous, especially given the affordable price tag for all of these items. If you were to purchase items like these separately (from a different brand) it would definitely be way over this price point. My favorite is the face cream. It is light, not too heavy or greasy, and just dries on your face with a nice moisturized feeling. Although I am using all these products myself, I could see this being a wonderful gift set. It makes a good gift for Mother’s Day or birthday. This also makes a good starter kit of basic skin care essentials. Not the most high end skin care but not bad.<br /><br />Just a tip: Although the product labels are in Chinese, there is English on each of the bottles stating what the product is (eg: eye cream)<br />You can throw away the packaging with the English product description but you just have to remember how to use it.\n",
      "24119->Blows away the other I masks I've tried | 5 | 0 | I shouldn't be surprised, since this brand has an incredibly good reputation for providing a high-end and effective experience, but I was indeed surprised by just how much I love these effective and cooling little gel eye masks. I have tried a number of gel eye masks in the past and found them reasonably pleasant, but this one actually left my skin around my eyes notably moisturized and looking younger for the rest of the day after use.<br /><br />I just put these on in the morning right after my shower and did the rest of my facial and hair care routine, got dressed and by the time I was ready to greet my day, I took off the eye masks and moisturized, and the moisture that the eye masks held in actually seemed to take hold and reduce the fine lines that I usually have around my eyes from lack of sleep and having small children and a business to manage.<br /><br />The fragrance is very light and unobtrusive, and the experience of using these is very luxurious. I have tried other eye masks that did not fit very well around my eye area, but these were shaped very nicely.\n",
      "24134->Worthless | 1 | 0 | I didn't get a chance to try these after pass return date and absolutely terrible. The measurement is inaccurate on the page and they have absolutely no suction whatsoever<br /><br />Just wasted the money\n",
      "24139->Invigorating and fragrant | 5 | 0 | I love the zingy, fragrant scent of the shampoo. It feels relatively unisex, and doesn't leave a lot of fragrance lingering behind after you rinse it out. I followed up with a peppermint conditioner from the natural food store, and really enjoyed the lovely cooling summer pick me up for my hair.<br /><br />The shampoo is not overly stripping, but definitely leans more towards really getting things clean rather than being overly moisturizing. I found that I could use it about three times a week on my long hair, and then needed to do co-washing or something more moisturizing in between. I really like the shampoo and appreciate having something more herbal like this in my regimen.\n",
      "24157->Absolutely love this product ! | 4 | 0 | This is a truly amazing conditioner !<br />I have dry frizzy curly hair , and this is so moisturizing.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars , but the downside is the smell , it is pretty bad !<br /><br />Why would you not add A citrus oil , or peppermint oil to make it smell good ?<br /><br />I will be adding oil to improve the scent.<br />I will buy it again , because it works great !\n",
      "24160->Neat concept, could be executed better | 3 | 0 | I really like the idea of a portable water pik. When I travel I have to pack up my standard water flosser and it's kinda bulky and doesn't travel well. So having a single integrated unit is appealing.<br /><br />However, the implementation is a bit weak. For starters the tank is either glued or heat welded along its entire perimeter and it will, I'm sure, be a weak spot that eventually leaks. As you use it, since it's all one piece, it's really hard to hold on to and the water runs directly down from my mouth on to the unit, making it even more slippery. Maybe the pik head should be angled to allow for the water not to run down on it.<br /><br />If you're someone who travels a lot and you need to have a water flosser with you I think this is worth a try. With some practice it might become less awkward to use over time.\n",
      "24174->Thin thin thin | 3 | 0 | There was no smell to it, and that was the only good thing.  It is super thin and the ends are even thinner.  It looks like one bundle of hair.  There is no way this is 130% density.  I don’t. Like super thick heavy wigs but I bought a 360 for the ability to put it in a ponytail and I definitly can’t do that I bleached the knots and a lot of them did not take.  The lace is soft and I did not need to tint it.  The hair is soft but there are lots of short  pieces  throughout that stick up.  I had to trim at least an inch and a half off the ends so it wouldn’t look so scraggly.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected more than a bundle of hair on this wig. The photo shows all the hair pulled to one side.  Don’t waste your money<br /><br />UPDATE:  after leaving my review the seller contacted me offering a partial refund to help remedy my bad experience.  Which goes a long way in terms of customer service to me.  I added a star, because they were concerned about making the product better based on my issues. Thank you\n",
      "24179->A Cadillac compare to my other light | 5 | 0 | This light is large, powerful, and easy to use. It has a long enough cord to reach any outlet that I need to. I like that it also has an option to charge my phone. It is all one piece so no worry about parts falling off when you lift it. However, the base can be removed if you choose.<br /><br />The timers include the standard 30 and 60 seconds as well as a 10 second option. There is a smart sensor option also.\n",
      "24189->Great product. Not great packaging. | 3 | 0 | I really like these wipes but the packaging is frustrating. It’s hard to not pull out a clump if them that have to be squeezed through the opening.<br /><br />It would so much better if the plastic top was made of recyclable plastic!\n",

I  sprayed their favorite toys and now they won't have anything to do with them!  I feel terrible.  It smells like human urine.  Its really bad!<br /><br />If you read the negative reviews on the dry xtreme, every single negative review is for this stuff, the spay, mistakenly added to the wrong product.\n",

It seems to work really well......when it works.<br />I have been through three of these. I like them enough to purchase another, but, have some complaints about their durability.<br /><br />My first two units refused to operate after about 3 months.  After the second one decided to stop working; I decided to take it apart..... What I found was pretty gross.......... Cr^p was growing inside and seemed to be........ well......it was not an attractive habitat inside the toothbrush.....not for me anyway....<br /><br />With my most recent battery operated toothbrush, I have decided to remove the brush head (right word?)and shake all the water out every time I use it. This one has been going strong, with every day use for over 6 months!<br /><br />It would be nice if the manufacturer gave instructions as to how to prolong the life of your purchase... but then again, they probably wouldn't make as many sales.<br /><br />They have sold me three in the course of a year.\n",

      "24221->Most Comfortable, Beautiful Headband That Doubles As A Crown | 5 | 0 | Crystal Rhinestone Gold Tone headband White/Mix color Gemstone Thin Hair Hoop goddess Daily hair accessory for Women Girls is the most comfortable gem studded headband I have ever worn. This is especially nice for younger people who hate the pain of a tight headband, but want to wear one for that special occasion. And this headband is so beautiful, you will want one for that special occasion.<br /><br />The headband itself feels like a very thin, light metal underneath soft gold fabric. The ends are wrapped yet again with a soft, silky black fabric to sit like a feather behind your ears. The stones are firmly set on a thin metal band which are attached to the gold fabric. What surprises me is this headband doesn’t slip at all on my medium size head. I can also wear it like a crown which looks stunningly beautiful with all the “diamonds” sparkling. It’s the loveliest headband that is beyond soft and comfortable and will make everyone feel like royalty when wearing it for a most special occasion. 5 STARS.\n",

Even with 3 coats it appears streaky and not consistent.<br /><br />At best this may work over a darker nail polish but its just going to be covering it up with a nearly constant streaked black and grey appearance.<br /><br />I don't recommend this product i'm sure there are better brands with the same effect in higher quality polish.

Decided to try this after visiting my hair stylist because he used this on my hair and he recommended it.<br />If it becomes a little too dry or hard then use a hot/warm blow dryer setting on it to soften it up a bit.<br />It gives texture and hold to your hair and it's much better than using sticky hair spray.<br />I have short, thick hair (although my stylist thins out and texturizes my hair leaving a huge mound on the floor every time I'm there!) and I absolutely need a product like this to style my hair.<br />I would recommend this product.\n",

It has a lovely fragrance that I for one really like a lot.<br /><br />The cream itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. I find that it leaves no residue on the skin behind and makes the skin feel very soft and moisturized. The skin looks great and feels amazing. At $20 this is a good price as well. I can only recommend this one since it seems to help reduce under eye puffiness, not so much the dark circles though but I do like how my skin looks overall.\n",
      "24344->'Fro Guy Incense | 5 | 0 | I used to get this all the time at my local head shop years ago, but I never could remember the name beyond \"something written in Indian\" because it was the only incense with a 'fro dude on one side and a blue dude on the other.<br />That doesn't get as many Google hits as you'd think, so finding it once I moved away and became sort of professional (i.e. not down with where all the good head shops are in my new town) was a bear. Glad to know the name now that my brain can remember it.<br /><br />This stuff is awesome as the package dude's 'fro, with spicy myrrh mixed with warm, vanilla-y benzoin notes in the base and a clean sandalwood finish.\n",

      "24370->A bit too oily for my skin. Most of the great ingredients are far down on the list... | 3 | 0 | This PENEBELLA Anti-Aging Face Cream is filled with emollient oils, and not much green tea, which is something I love in a skin care product. My skin is normal to oily, but also sensitive, and cannot handle all of the oils in this product. It sort of just sits on top of my skin.<br />I really wish the company would have listed the ingredients, instead of pointing out the great ingredients that are in minute amounts. Aside from glycerin, the other touted ingredients are almost halfway down, or lower, on the ingredients list, or are not so skin friendly. Green tea is wonderful for your skin, but it is near the bottom of the ingredients list. Also, the type of vitamin C, Ascorbyl Palmitate, is not very skin friendly, and can actually be very irritating to sensitive skin, like mine.<br />This moisturizer may work well for those with very dry skin, but I would have liked to see the boasted about skin loving ingredients closer to the top of the ingredients list. Full transparency is always best, and will make customers happy. Listing some wonderful ingredients that are minimally effective in very small amounts, is a bit misleading. This moisturizer has way too many oils for my skin, is a bit irritating, and is not my favorite...\n",

      "24451->I love these! | 3 | 0 | Update: this is my second time buying these braids, and as much as I love how easy they are to install, goodness do they shed. Instantly, tons of shedding from the ends all the way up. When I trim off loose pieces, very carefully, it seems to create a million more. I sleep with them in a satin scarf and don't mess with them very much, they just have a frizzy life of their own. As much as I love the color, I'm going to try a different color and maybe a different brand in the future.<br /><br />This was my first time self-installing braids already braided; as a mixed Afro-Indigenous person who didn't grow up having my hair braided and has struggled to find a method of doing it that won't give me a migraine for days (last time 😬), these were such a gift.<br /><br />Super easy install; it still took several hours, but I'm new to this so I expected that. My 2C-3B  hair is very short and fine, (see photo), so I did a mixture of rubber bands and tiny braids to crochet into, with Murray's edgewax to separate and Got To Be Ultra Glued to hold it. (Thank you many YouTube tutorials!)<br /><br />I've had so many compliments on them, and a lot of surprise when I share they were pre-braided and self-intalled. Compared to my last  braids, these are lightweight and soft, although the blonder ends are a bit rough. I did an Apple Cider Vin + warm water soak, gentle shampoo, and a deep conditioner + warm water soak, followed by a very thorough rinse. Then I hung them to dry from their gold bands for several days before I installed them. I still have two packs left over, and have a big head! 🙌🏽<br /><br />I'm honestly so happy with them, and glad I did them myself. One day I would really love to have my hair braided professionally, but this is an amazing option for myself!\n",
      "24465->Good Razor - Very Disposable - No Replacement Blades | 3 | 0 | This is a very straight forward razor with a stand up holder that uses a very low power magnet to keep the razor in place.<br /><br />The razor itself is nothing fancy and I have been using it for about four days. I have not had any issues. The handle is a little awkward to hold when it gets soapy, but it is not a deal breaker. I do like the stand up holder because then the razor is standing and out of the way. I do wish the magnet was a little stronger.<br /><br />There is one replacement blade, but apparently after that you have to buy a new kit. I could not find replacement blades for sale anywhere on Amazon.\n",
      "24484->Great scents! | 5 | 0 | I ordered these about a month ago so I've had a chance to use a few of these. If you are looking for a substitute for a Lush bomb this wouldn't be it. Lush bombs have bright colors and these colors are definitely less noticeable. However, these are still perfectly nice bath bombs! They smell really nice and have essential oils which make your skin feel fabulous. I'd definitely recommend it for a great gift for friend or family.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own. I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. My hope is that these reviews are helpful to others. Please let me know how I am doing by voting “Yes” if you think that my review helped you. If it did not, please comment with how I can improve; this helps me to be a better reviewer. While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product. Again, it is just my opinion; your own opinion might vary. I received no monetary compensation and not required to give a good review\n",
      "24494->Y E S S | 5 | 0 | I was really surprised how satisfied I was! I’m not a lash type of girl besides some mascara an some eyeliner. So when it came to these it provided that BOOM I was missing.<br />My one down fall was the eyeliner you use for the magnets to work in general dried up by the third set I applied. So when ordering recommend getting a back up eyeliner that compatible with this type of product.\n",
      "24497->Fluffs Out Oddly | 4 | 0 | In the mission of finding one to match my hair color, this is the third of these I have tried. Of them, it probably matches the closest, but is still a little too dark. (sigh) One day...<br />The elastic is completely invisible, and will fit snug around my hair bun. The only thing is it sits differently compared to others I've tried, with the hair flipping out in the opposite direction of what looks natural. I've tried a couple different ways, but it always looks odd, so someone can definitely tell  this isn't your hair. Oh well.\n",
      "24533->Pretty good | 4 | 0 | My hair is soft, moisturized and bouncy. No weight from products to try to add this after washing. Love that all the primary ingredients are natural oils so I know my tortured hair is getting some much needed love.<br /><br />Down side, the &#34;one pump&#34; instructions is not enough for my slightly longer than shoulder length hair, instead opting for two, which gets the job done. For the price, I'm a little disappointed that apparently going through this twice as fast. May have to use this more as a go to shampoo when my hair really needs it. But overall, very pleased (now I just need a new haircut to manage all this new volume and curls!)\n",
      "24535->I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options | 2 | 0 | These nails are beautiful for a french manicure but they ended up looking absolutely terrible after applying. I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These \"symbols\" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth. I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options.\n",
      "24536->TOO BIG! JUST SLIDES OFF | 1 | 0 | Arrived quickly. Didn’t inspect them much as placing the first one on my head, it just kept on sliding off the back of my head. These are WAAAY TOO BIG!!! I tried it with a mask and I kept on having to rearrange and shift mask to stay on face as the hair band would slide off. Simply way TOO BIG!!!! I wasn’t even walking or moving. Sitting still it slides off quickly. If I was walking slowly it fell off instantly and I have a lot of hair! It should not do this! I bought a two different brand hair bands Recently and they all stay put! Maybe I will take the buttons off and sew them on those other vendors’ hair bands!<br /><br />If you have a normal sized head and hair or straight hair, these will not stay put!\n",
      "24540->I'm happy with the lotion itself | 3 | 0 | I'd give it a higher rating if the pump worked properly..it also doesn't seem the bottle is very full upon unscrewing the lid.<br />I'm happy with the lotion itself, I've been using it at night before bed, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, I've had no breakouts from using this at all, which I am prone to. Overall it's okay. I did receive this at at discount.\n",
      "24546->Not impressed with the quality. | 1 | 0 | This Acrylic Nail Brush Set would have been nice, but my fine liners are messed up. I have tried to fix them and so far, nothing works. Not impressed.<br /><br />The tube comes with 8 brushes in different sizes and brush types. These brushes are used to decorate the nail when the brushes are in good shape. There are no instructions included.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Acrylic Nail Brush Set to family and friends.\n",
      "24557->Smells like tea tree, but that’s all...? | 3 | 0 | I understand that it used for rashes or blemishes but I’m not exactly sure if it’s supposed to make them go away (if that’s the case then this didn’t do anything) or if this is just supposed to make the skin less irritated (then yes it does work). My skin won’t be as red from a rash but this isn’t some miracle “go away” cure.<br />Overall, it’s okay.\n",
      "24564->Look great, so-so quality... | 3 | 0 | On the upside: These look nicer than the average elastic, love the thickness, and they are gentle on hair.<br />On the downside: Colors in photo not the same as what arrived and a couple of them have already “given out”.\n",
      "24570->Decent but not high end mascara. | 4 | 0 | This is decent mascara. I wanted it to curl my lashes so badly. It’s a bit pricey so I thought it would be high end.<br /><br />It’s not bad but it’s nothing amazing either. It’s really wet and clumpy. No curl action really. Does the job though.\n",
      "24571->Hmmm | 3 | 0 | Honestly, when I first took these out of the package I thought they were truly hideous! But on, they are more subtle than they appeared and are quite nice for a super \"girly\" look. But the size is a bit weird. They are both too big and too small for my head - they are just long enough to reach my ears (and I'm only five feet tall) but they are a bit too wide. I find them uncomfortable. I also wear glasses and they just don't feel good with them, but I generally do find that with hard headbands, so that's just me.<br /><br />Maybe they'll fit a girl better even though I am the size of a small  twelve-year-old! I wish I had a kid who would try these on.<br /><br />They are actually surprisingly cute on, but some of the beads (they're not rhinestones) look like they're about to fall off. I would not recommend buying these and they really aren't worth even the seemingly good price for how many there are. They're definitely cheap feeling and looking.\n",
      "24586->This kit is so-so | 3 | 0 | I ordered this kit based on the 4-star rating. When I received it I found that the eyeshadow brushes are way too stuff to really be useful. The powder and foundation brushes are great, the lip and eyeliner brushes are excellent, if a bit long (but bristles are easy to trim). The fan brush is okay, and the case is okay as well.<br /><br />The case is a bit larger than I expected (I neglected to measure my purse before ordering the brush set) so it barely fits in my purse so I usually bring a smaller brush set with me when I go out, leaving this kit at home.<br /><br />I actually ordered this one to replace old eyeshadow brushes, and so I was kind of annoyed that those particular brushes are worthless, so I went out and bought quality brushes at $20 a pop.<br /><br />Also, I do not bother with the eyebrow brush/comb, and it is already falling apart just from being in the case.<br /><br />It's worth it if you need a new case for your brushes, and also need new foundation and powder brushes, but expect to immediately throw a bunch of the brand-new brushes directly into the trash.<br /><br />- Update months later -<br /><br />I still use some of the brushes that came with the set but threw away most of them. I kept the larger ones since they work well for foundation, bronzer, blush, etc. and kept one of the smaller brushes for lip color but the others left a lot to be desired. Also, the brushes I did keep fell apart; the metal crimp does not hold the handles well so I used super glue gel to reattach them.  I still like the case though!\n",
      "24604->Don't buy! | 2 | 0 | These are AWFUL!! The magnets are weak, they are freaking hard to get on perfect. When you finally get them on somewhat decent. They are super straight on your eyes, they are not/do not look natural, they don't curve to your eyelid.<br />LUCKILY.... the company was awesome, and gave a full refund no questions asked, and I didn't need to return the lashes! I am giving this 2 stars, because of how great the company was!! The product it's self is ONE star.\n",
      "24617->Fine for a novelty or joke gift, not for the serious KS peeps. | 3 | 0 | Ok, if you like powders and heating liquids, you will like this tiny box.<br /><br />For us, it was a novelty at best. The butterfly was the size of a half-dollar coin (maybe slightly bigger) so that was disappointing.<br /><br />The flavors are good, but in my opinion you would be better off getting certain things individually.\n",
      "24618->Epsom salt works better and has a better scent | 2 | 0 | I take Epsom salt baths occasionally to help ease the aches and pains from working out. When I came across this, it caught my eye as I love the scent of lavender and the product description says it soothes sore muscles.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I ran into a problem. There were no instructions on how much to add in the bath. So I searched the internet and it's basically based on how strong you like the scent. I used far less than what I would for Epsom salt. Maybe a few tablespoons. It was plenty strong. I've had better smelling lavender bath products than this one. Furthermore, after taking a bath, my muscles didn't feel any better. I feel an improvement when I use Epsom salt.<br /><br />Won't be using this product again between the disappointing scent and inability to soothe tired muscles.\n",
      "24620->A Stellar Product at a Great Price | 5 | 0 | I used to use the Smooth shampoo with the Smooth conditioner but it seems that the Smooth shampoo is no longer available.  This product does an excellent job but it smells just like GK Global Keratin shampoo which is the world’s best in Keratin conditioning and smoothing but not my favorite scent. You will probably like it. i’m just really picky about fragrances.<br /><br />This shampoo definitely has an extra something above and b you did the GK brand that makes my hair so shiny that it practically sparkles. It’s amazing how it catches the light. The product definitely lives up to its name and the price point is very economical.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you want to have amazing shine with a sulfate - free shampoo.\n",
      "24637->Cute but heavy in the hair | 4 | 0 | Well made clips are cute. If hair is fine, they may slide out, as they are surprisingly heavy for their size.<br />Good price and fun to use.\n",
      "24686->Not recommended | 1 | 0 | UPDATE: unfortunately this product doesn’t seem to last for very long after application... all my nails started popping off within a few hours ☹️<br /><br />Took a little bit of practice but this kit is great for the price 🙂\n",
      "24688->Face felt like it was burning from it. | 2 | 0 | I wanted to like it. Opened it and it smelled good. After one wash my face was burning on fire. Don't know what ingrediant did it but it did<br />And I am usually not sensitive to products.\n",
      "24699->Great for the price | 4 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:6fdce2c5072467befd241ba9bd9d2ece]] Thought the design of this was great with the combs on both sides and the dents for curling so I thought I would try it out!<br />Pros: heats up fast, comes with a bunch of accessories (I didn’t need to use the glove even on the highest setting) the combs.<br />Cons: every time I used it to curl my hair I would end up turning the heat down (design flaw) You pay for what you get. This does straighten and curl but not as well as a nice straightener.<br />My daughter with natural curly hair used it to straighten her hair and said she liked it not as much as the expensive one but for the price it worked well!\n",
      "24712->Cheap, cheap cheap! | 1 | 0 | This lasted 4 hair brushings and bristles detached from handle. The bristles were very hard and made my scalp feel like blades were cutting me.<br />It claims to be a detangler but it was more a hair puller.<br />I had a handful of hair that it pulled off my head.<br />Now, I am seriously an expert in brushes since I have long thick hair down to my butt and have for 30+ years. I got this trying to save a few bucks and you definitely get what tou pay for.\n",
      "24726->Wrong item | 1 | 0 | I ordered the Rose and got the pineapple instead<br /> Unfortunately the pineapple smells weird, I don't like it. And the wipes are a bit on the dry side.\n",
      "24728->It works!! | 5 | 0 | It’s helps to keep the yellow out of my gray hair<br />Does a good job\n",
      "24731->Cool for traveling | 3 | 0 | These are great little shower gels for traveling<br />I would prefer a Richer lather<br />And fragrances that were more mature shall I say I would not recommend this cause it was not the best shower gel for me, but try your luck and see if you like it if not, I was that has a great return policy\n",
      "24740->Not as good as traditional straighteners | 2 | 0 | This works okay at best. My hair is usually easy to straighten, but the brush isn't hot enough to keep it straight throughout the day. After about an hour it will start to frizz. You get much better results with a hair straightener.<br /><br />It broke after about 8 months of use. The connecting cord came loose and it's going in the trash.\n",
      "24745->Not as Pictured | 3 | 0 | I ordered this headband because it matched part of a dress my daughter will be wearing for an upcoming special event. However, the headband I received is missing the small \"halo\" of stones around each larger stone (which had been the main reason for choosing this particular style) and the solder points made audible cracking noises when my daughter tried the piece on.<br /><br />Overall the headband will still work for the event and for a $9 price point I did not expect the quality to be exceptional, but given the discrepancy in style I would not choose to order from this company in the future.\n",
      "24772->Like it | 5 | 0 | I am not going to lie, I thought this was going to be cheap and rip easily. I was wrong it works very well with long hair and it is tight so all<br />My hair fits in it !\n",
      "24777->Many people like it but I didn’t | 2 | 0 | I live in California and mostly time wear open shoes, and I want my feet look good. I don’t have possibility to visit pedicure salon. So I bought this foot scrub tool to do pedicure at home.<br />I can’t tell it’s bad product- no it’s a good product (easy to hold and to use, rope is a little bonus...), but it didn’t leave my feet feeling smooth and the tool did a small harm.<br />But many people like this kind of dead skin removers.\n",
      "24798->Made for man hands | 3 | 0 | First the pros: strong texture and seem to stay on so far.<br /><br />Here is my main issue. The nails are so large that I had to clip many of them in half and so much filing needed. We buy fake nails to do less work, not more. I have average sized hands but like my nails to look good and not tacky, wide, and clunky. I noticed that many women enjoy wearing nails in this style so these might be perfect for you. I do encounter this problem often when there are not enough nail sizes.\n",
      "24800->Horrible | 1 | 0 | This polish is so sheer and streaky.<br />I love the brush sure but the quality of the polish itself is horrible.<br />I have to do three coats and the end result ain’t worth the extra time and patience it requires.\n",
      "24805->Just Meh | 2 | 0 | The bristles are super soft, almost like a make-up brush soft. Too soft to clean anything. They were a light gray and got lighter after first use. 6 bristles fell out during first use. I doubt these have any charcoal compared to the deep, black coloring of other brushes.<br /><br />The toothpaste is an unknown brand from China. I'll try many things, but I ain't trying that.\n",
      "24825->Nice Hair | 5 | 0 | Didnt have time to post a photo, maybe later. LOL<br /><br />So, I have been waiting to wash the hair until I posted a review. Had the hair installed on Nov. 6th, washed it this morning in the shower, used my regular shampoo and conditioner, sprayed a leave in conditioner in and used a big comb, and wig brush, added a little coconut oil, hair is beautiful and shiny. If time permits I will submit a photo later.\n",
      "24860->They float in water. | 4 | 0 | The chickens accepted these in the nesting boxes but not as much so as real eggs.  Using these eliminates the need to cycle out the older marked eggs I used in the nesting boxes and eliminates the possibility of exploding rotten eggs.<br /><br />They are much lighter than a real egg, the finish is a little rougher than a real egg and they have a chalky appearance.\n",
      "24866->Too slushey | 4 | 0 | Almost a liquid, I am<br />Using two separate products but seems to help. Just slushey\n",
      "24874->Used For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details | 5 | 0 | I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.\n",
      "24875->not good for my lashes | 2 | 0 | I don't think I will buy this item again: it does not deliver on lash length nor volume and it's pretty hard to remove.  Overall I definitely don't think this is a good product for my lashes, which are thin and of a lighter color.<br /><br />Pro:<br />nice dark black color<br />nice applicator brush<br />nice looking tube<br /><br />con:<br />does not give volume nor thickness to my lashes<br />hard to remove (I had to use a cotton ball with coconut oil)<br />some lashes will come off with the mascara when you remove it\n",
      "24888->Of the three I have tried this was the worst | 2 | 0 | I tried a couple other charcoal peel off masks before this that were MUCH much easier to use, both a bit more expensive but neither crazy so. Luckily I had no issues with the bottle splitting like some others reported. Here is what I did not like about the product.<br /><br />Issue #1: This one didn't peel off in nice big patches more like you had to chip away at it which was messy time consuming and harsher on my face than it needed to be.<br /><br />Issue#2: It also was ineffective, it didn't unclog anything. At most it removed a top layer of dead skin making my skin feel softer (and dryer), but after rechecking my pores with a magnifying mirror (if you want to hate yourself buy one and then freak out at your skin, lol) there was no real difference. The before and after of my pores under the mirror were nearly identical.<br /><br />So all that work and annoyed skin for nothing. Mostly though I was just aggravated that it came apart in a million little shreds rather than actually just peel off my skin. That's the best part, booooo.\n",
      "24889->Tear Free?! I Think NOT... | 1 | 0 | No, no, no, no, no... tear free?!?! So if you read the description above it says MULTIPLE times how “mild” and “gentle” this stuff is! And YES, they did indeed use the EXACT phrase “Tear Free”....BIG LIE!<br /> My 1 year old daughter got literally just some SUDS in her eye (the shampoo that sometimes drips down the front of your forehead) not even full on shampoo, some suds, so watered down and she was SCREAMING!!! Her poor little eye was BRIGHT pink too when she finally stopped rubbing it and screaming!! Now... I usually use Johnson and Johnson and all sometimes the Honest Company... she NEVER EVER EVER EVER screamed this hard before when this has happened!! Johnson and Johnson she barely notices it! I rinse her eyes and pat it gently.. she is good. Honest Company eh, she’ll rub it for a bit but no crying or real pain, just irritation. But this stuff... oh no! My poor daughter!! I guess I’ll have to use it on myself because it’s EXPENSIVE for 8oz!! I wanted to try it because it being cruelty free and “more natural” products. No thanks!! I’ll go back to what I used to use! So sad... great idea... but whatever you put in there had my poor baby panicking! She was crying so hard and violently rubbing her little eye, ugh, broke my heart. Never. Again. Garbage product!! LITERALLY.\n",
      "24896->They work | 4 | 0 | As stated by others, the combs are a bit flimsy at this length but they do work.<br /><br />Would by again.\n",
      "24898->I have been using it for months and love it! | 5 | 0 | I have been using this eye cream for months, day and night, and just adore it. It’s very emollient without being greasy at all.<br /><br />I am usually sensitive to products and this gave me no negative reactions.<br /><br />It only takes a tiny little bit to moisturize my upper and lower lids. Of course, I stay away from the eyelash area as I don’t want any of this in my eyes.<br /><br />One jar has lasted for months.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is the container as it means sticking my finger into it and I really don’t like that delivery system. I would vastly prefer if it had a small nozzle tube that could stand on its end. I know it wouldn’t look as fancy, but it would be far more user friendly.\n",
      "24917->Very rough texture | 1 | 0 | Used this hair for faux locs. The reviews were 50/50 on quality. I decided to try for myself. The hair has some kind of chemical in it that leaves a residue on your hands. Make sure if you buy this hair you use ACV. The hair maintained its rough texture and feel after cleansing. There are 3 bundles of hair and the hair is not even in length or thickness. I noticed I had to use 2 strands on some locs to even out the loc thickness.<br />Even after cleansing the hair was still itchy. Had to run water though my finished locs and air dry. Such a hassle. Will never buy this hair again.\n",
      "24918->Looks neat but small | 4 | 0 | Package includes: 2 spray bottles<br />This 7oz spray bottle has an adjustable nozzle and translucent bottle to easily see liquid levels. It can be used for a variety of home and garden application.\n",
      "24937->Smells good, don’t understand the pouch | 2 | 0 | The sleeve it came with I thought was pointless. I bought to try instead of my normal shampoo bar and it left my hair feeling weighed down and blah looking. After my second use, noticed that I started having an allergic reaction to it behind my ear.<br /><br />It smells good, works on my sons hair nicely.\n",
      "24938->Caused hives | 2 | 0 | Update- I wanted to update this since I appreciated Skyn's customer service reaching out to me.<br /><br />I really hoped/wanted this product to help my sensitive skin since it is difficult to find something that does not irritate it.  The ingredients in this product sounded hopeful.  Unfortunately there is something in it that caused my face to break out in hives.\n",
      "24940->It's not what I thought it would be | 3 | 0 | I gave this 3 stars for \"Softness\" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the \"good exfoliating\" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the \"ouch, that's scratching me\" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for \"Easy to use\" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.  It doesn't seem like a cheap product that's going to warp and break easily if you keep it away from hanging to be soaked when it's not needed for use.  Putting it somewhere nearby where it stays dry is best.\n",
      "24954->High Quality, Low Cost | 5 | 0 | This is what I love about these, versus other, more expensive makeup sponges:<br /><br />Not overly big (about 20% smaller than most) so easy to get all areas of the face.<br />Soft to the touch, they do not pull on the skin. Also, the light colors help determine when to clean them.<br />Just squishy enough. Not too hard like a lot of them but not so soft they are not effective.<br />Application is very nice, surprisingly, better than expensive ones.<br />I used dry and damp. Either way, doesn't soak up all the makeup.<br />Because they are squishy, most of the water is wrung out, making a  truly \"just damp\" sponge.<br />Application of foundation superior to expensive sponges...what a surprise.<br />No dyes coming out when cleaning, no funky smells, dries very fast.<br />I honestly cannot find a thing wrong with these. I have been on the hunt for the perfect makeup sponge for 2 years now. I think I found them!\n",
      "24969->Love them | 5 | 0 | Great elastics and they have just a little sparkle to them.<br />I guess I didn't pay attention to how many elastics were included and was pleasantly surprised when I found out. Enough elastics for a harem.\n",
      "24971->Not Authentic Blades | 3 | 0 | These are not authentic double blades from Flawless they are replicas. However, they do work so I’m keeping them. The reason they received 3<br />star and not 5 is because they’re not authentic Flawless blades.\n",
      "24972->Great alternative to the salon & pricey nail wraps | 5 | 0 | I love to have pretty nails but we are constantly doing some kind of project around our home.<br /><br />I generally don't have time to go to get my nails done because with 4 kids and a hubby that works crazy hours it's hard to schedule.<br /><br />I've been very fond of the Jamberry brand but unless I put a clear gel top coat on my nails look awful after a day or two. Also these don't need a heater or blow dryer to apply.<br /><br />I really like all the designs in this package and that it took no special heater or tools to put these on my nails. I only needed a nail file and it took less than 5 minutes to do 5 fingers.<br /><br />A great alternative to pricey salon trips.<br /><br />I paid full price for this item and provided this review for informational purposes only.\n",
      "24978->Do not recommend buying this product. | 1 | 0 | Horrible product.  The loop is way too big making it impossible for the braid to stay in place without slipping.  Once the hair is in it becomes extremely frizzy (see pic).  I only had it in one day and it began to friz and snag.<br />The hair is extremely heavy and hard to pin up.\n",
      "24979->Pamper Yourself... | 5 | 0 | Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.  I absolutely recommend Huxley.\n",
      "24989->Vitamin C Serum and Phytoceramides - my favorite skin combo | 5 | 0 | Vitamin C Serum and Phytoceramides - my favorite skin combo! I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin lately and it's all thanks to these products! I don't think I'll ever give this combo up, as it has truly helped with my issues regarding skin dryness. It's well priced and most importantly, it delivers the results that it guarantees to give. This winter has been tremendously harsh on my skin and I don't know what I would have done, without these products. Go check it out - it's worth all the hype!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.\n",
      "24996->Rips Easy and need to add water. | 2 | 0 | They are okay, we have to add water to them so they clean a poopy butt but they are OK for pee butts.  Good price, but they rip really easy compared to Pampers wipes.<br /><br />So I gave 2 stars because they rip real easy and you have to add water.  Other than that they would be great.  Its more like 2.5 stars but they don't have .5 so they get lower rating.\n",
      "25001->A bit heavy, but good for drier skin and full coverage | 5 | 0 | Used to use a Max Factor line of foundation that was discontinued.  This is a fuller coverage foundation, but since I am in my fifties, this is what I need.  My skin is sensitive to product and I have no reaction to this.  Not super natural looking, but it does settle down after a few hours.<br /><br />Of course with the oiler product it will get on a towel as you fine tune coverage\n",
      "25005->Lovely | 5 | 0 | These were so sparkly. I really loved these!!!!<br /><br />These looked very pretty in my daughter’s hair. They really stood out. They looked just like the picture. They went in and out easily. They stayed in fairly well. They were very pretty. She liked them a lot. They really made her look nice. They would also look nice for pictures. The quality was pretty decent. It is nice that it is a set and you get a bunch. I liked the variety. I was happy and would recommend it.<br />They also helped keep her hair out of her face.\n",
      "25023->Best out there | 5 | 0 | I love LOVE this product.  It is thicker than the regular UV top coats and it seals so perfectly!  I won't get anything else.  But, I do suggest you shop around before spending the outrageous price of $15 on here!  I got my \"3\" bottles for less than $8!<br /><br />I recommend this product!\n",
      "25035->Did not like the bristles on teeth but maybe on toilet | 2 | 0 | I had a bamboo toothbrush before and it was so soft<br />I will keep using this for cleaning tiles and other stuff\n",
      "25038->When color matched in-person, this is a great product. | 4 | 0 | I purchased this online after verifying my correct shade in-store at Sephora, so it is crucial to know your shade before chancing it on buying online.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, I really like this foundation. It is a fuller coverage without being cakey, and as someone with dry skin I find it applies great when I moisturize my face and add a moisturizing primer. The key with foundation is not only color matching, but how you apply it (I use a Beauty Blender) and how nourished your skin is before applying. If you've got the basics covered, this is a great foundation.\n",
      "25055->Not for adults | 2 | 0 | Way too soft. Way too small. I read other reviews stating this but still thought it would be ok for my needs. Nope!  I regret buying this baby brush.<br /> If you’re buying for a kid &lt;10, then it will be great. Quality seems good enough and not much shedding.\n",
      "25071->Good product of the smell wasn’t so terrible | 1 | 0 | The product works great BUT it smells awful!<br />Question: could I possibly have a defective product and perhaps it was spoiled in some way?  My husband used the product about a month after I ordered it.\n",
      "25077->What IS this? | 1 | 0 | Mine came with no directions, so I assumed it was just something I put on my fingernails, maybe let sit for a bit, and wipe off.<br />Nope!<br />I tried ALL kinds of ways to use this and my gel nail polish was still there. To top it off, maybe I got an old bottle because the contents were globular. I was expecting nail polish texture, this instead looked like slime and was a thick consistency. Waste of $$$\n",
      "25094->Love these clips | 4 | 0 | These clips are great they can be used when styling your hair or just to tie it back. I like the colors and they are very durable none have broken so far and ive had them a while i use them when straightening my hair as it long i need to do section by section and they hold my hair in place and do not scratch my scalp which is a plus.<br />I would recommend and buy again if need be in the future!\n",
      "25096->Pretty but poor quality | 2 | 0 | Hair is soft and pretty but goes bald in front. And it is noticeable. I have to use fibers and color stick to camouflage.  It is difficult and I feel self conscious.<br /><br />It went bald in less than a week and in the worst possible place.\n",
      "25114->Roller Ball May Not Be the Best Mode of Application | 3 | 0 | I've been using this serum for 5 days, AM and PM.  I believe I see some minor reduction in the lines under my eyes...but it could be wishful thinking.  I am not convinced there is always serum coming out while rolling it on because the nature of steel is that it feels cool to the touch, therefore can give the impression of depositing serum when, in fact, it isn't.  To determine this I ran it over white tissue several times; only about 50% of the time did serum actually come out.  I removed and cleaned the steel roller ball as directed then reran my \"experiment\" and had the same results.<br /><br />During application I can briefly detect a damp look where it is being deposited, but this goes away within seconds.  At other times nothing is on the surface of my face and immediate dabbing with a tissue proves there is no serum.  I am not convinced this is the best mode of application.<br /><br />If, after a couple of months of use, I see definite wrinkle reduction I will happily update my review accordingly.\n",
      "25128->Really lovely detoxing bath soak | 4 | 0 | This has an exceptionally refreshing fragranced with essential oils. Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br /><br />Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br /><br />Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product. The quality level is great, it's just a matter of how much do you want to spend for a single bath.\n",
      "25152->Flip button stucked on forward | 2 | 0 | Update:<br />Not even a year old and it completely broke.<br />It worked fine for 1 month and the button the flips the speeds left or right got stuck and will not move. The drill will only roll  one direction now. Everything else works fine. Pedal is too light weight to take it seriously.\n",
      "25159->After 6 Yrs the light just stopped | 1 | 0 | I loved it until the light failed. After 6 Yrs the light just stopped & you cannot replace the elements. VERY disappointed!<br />Keep looking for a better product.\n",
      "25166->Keeps the skin soft and smooth | 4 | 0 | Scrubs are a nice way to get rid of dead skin, so this seemed like a good way to go. It isn't full of a bunch of chemicals and is similar to a salt scrub. It's not all wet, so don't go wiping it on your face without first getting it wet. The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br /><br />It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances. Over all it's a good scrub and works well for what it is used for.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I HAVE TRIED THIS AND EVALUATED IT ACCORDINGLY\n",
      "25169->Patches break easily | 3 | 0 | Having previously been disappointed with another one of their product (spilled and dried out), I was half expecting this product to arrive the same way. While this one did not arrive dried out, it was disappointing to see the eye patches were not drenched in the solution like most eye patches I’ve tried. They looked almost dry. It applies fine but just would have been better soaked in more solution.<br /><br />The patches also breaks too easily. I just put my fingernails on it and it split apart. I usually wear my glasses when I am using eye patches at night and have never experienced any that tore during use but these did. It tore near/underneath my eyeglass nose pad, which I had not touched with my fingers. When I went to remove them they broke apart in several pieces, which has never happened with any eye patches I have used. Overall these just did not leave a good impression on me.\n",
      "25177->Lovely product, not great value | 5 | 0 | These are great for traveling, where you may not want to bring along bottles that may leak or cause a problem. These are easy to pop in a Ziploc and carry with you, and are lightweight and very easy to use.<br /><br />I just tested these at home by wetting them in my sink, scrubbing them across my face to clean at the end of the day, and they did a great job getting off sunscreen and oils so that I could do my nighttime facial skincare routine. They did not cleanse overly much to where my skin felt tight or dry, and my skin felt cleansed but still retaining some of its natural moisture.\n",
      "25178->Don't fall for the positive reviews by people who got free ones! | 1 | 0 | So, I had a Clarsonic for 8 years. Worked great but I thought maybe this could replace it. NO WAY! This is a cheap version and doesn't work well at all. I will elaborate...first of all, it pulled my skin. The head wobbles and at one point, wobbled off the side of my face, grabbed a chunk of hair and nearly pulled it out of my scalp. I operated it like the Clarsonic and was pretty shocked by this wobble-y knock-off spinning out of control on my face. I am in no way making this up and I paid for mine - so pay no attention to the \"freebie\" reviews.<br /><br />I bought mine direct from Vanity Planet, not Amazon, but either way, it is over-priced. I wouldn't keep it if you gave it to me for free. Can you tell I am bitter about all the great (fake) reviews?\n",
      "25184->Smooth and quick drying. | 4 | 0 | Liked that it went on smooth and dried quickly. Only time will tell how it works on curing my fingernail fungus.<br />It seems to be wearing well with no snags.\n",
      "25188->Only 15 ml bottles stay in the foam when the case is zipped and picked up as if to carry it. | 3 | 0 | I knew about the logo on the front ahead of time, I put a bumper sticker over it.  I would rather the logo not be there at all but I needed a case so I bought it.  I did not realize the logo was so huge that it's larger than my bumper sticker.<br /><br />My problem with the case is that the 5ml bottles and the 10ml rollers are not tight enough in the foam and fall out easily when the case is picked up, even when zipped completely.  I will have to invest in some foam to put on top if I want to be able to use this as a carry case.  I'm disappointed\n",
      "25203->Perfect for my skin | 5 | 0 | I have been applying Shea Butter for about 18 months now.  This product is the best - no chemicals, not oily or sticky, and very good for the skin.  I apply it on my face after shower everyday.  During the cold dry months, I apply it over the whole body after a shower.<br /><br />Can not say enough good things about Shea Butter.  It has made my skin soft and supple.  I have no dry skin or itching problems in the winter months.\n",
      "25208->Didn't work for my iPad but it is a good device | 4 | 0 | I bought this to provide in-wall power for my 2nd generation iPad (30-pin connector). The kit comes with all the connectors pictured; you supply your own CAT-x cable for the Connection between the power supply and voltage regulator. Before putting it in the wall I set it up with my iPad and charging cable and found that it wouldn't charge or even power the tablet. The USB jack has only the power wires connected but nothing on the data lines, so neither the iPad nor my iPhone 6+ would recognize it as a charging supply. I could I'm sure modify the connector or make my own adapter but I ended up abandoning the project in favor of another solution because I needed it working within a couple days.<br /><br />Build quality seems fine, it does what it says though the Ethernet pass-through port is only 4 wires so it can only carry 100 MBit data.\n",
      "25248->Disappointed | 3 | 0 | I was super excited to try out the top coat and true to previous reviews,  it's easy to use and apply to nails.  Extra drying time seals the deal.  However,  my nail chipped 3 days later.  That's where the value for my$ goes down.<br /><br />I will try again and hope for better results.\n",
      "25250->Love the shampoo, not so much the conditioner | 3 | 0 | Review for: Purple Shampoo and Conditioner ​Set - ​Sulfate Free Salon Grade (2 x 16.9 fl oz) - Hydrating Toner - Shimmer ​Correction​ ​for​ Platinum Blonde, Silver, Light, ​and Grey​ Hair<br /><br />I love the purple shampoo. I has really good lather, a strong pump and a wonderful scent. It lathers easily and also rinses out easily. I like how my hair feels after using it. I am not so much of a fan of the conditioner. I was a bit surprised that after putting it in my hair, my hair did not feel slick like it does with most conditioners. It actually felt quite coarse. I always brush my hair while in the shower with the conditioner still in it. I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots. Once dry, my hair felt normal.<br /><br />I have ceased using the conditioner but I do like the affect of the purple shampoo on my salt and pepper hair.\n",
      "25252->Ready to change your bathroom game? | 5 | 0 | This tube is the product I never knew I needed. I thought to order this on a whim and now realize that this is a necessity. Let me explain.<br />How to use: take a small pea sized amount and put it on the TP. Wipe. I use this after initial wipe to ensure what this does is remove all residue and leave behind a clean, fresh tush.<br />This cream does not have a heavy scent and is transportable - you can carry in your bag because we all know emergencies happen. A little goes a long way so expect this to last awhile. I’ve had this several weeks and it’s going strong. What I anticipate will be a problem will be getting to the bottom of the tube. I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it.<br />Price at time of this review is 25USD which some may find steep but perfectly normal for the ingredients and the use you get from the tube.\n",
      "25254->Takes a Bit to Get the Hang of It, But Does a Great Job | 5 | 0 | For a few years now my dentist has been telling me that I should get a \"water pick\", she said that it's more effective than flossing alone, and will help reduce the plaque build up between visits. I've meant to pick one up for awhile, and when I saw this cordless water flosser, I jumped at it.<br /><br />It does take a little while to get a hang of, for the first few times, I sprayed my face and the mirror, and everything else in the vicinity of my sink. But once I got the hang of it, I could feel the results immediately.\n",
      "25255->Decent exfoliator | 4 | 0 | I used this exfoliator while washing my face, and it worked good for that. Seems to exfoliate well. I plan to continue using it.<br /><br />It would have been nice if there was some way to hang it.\n",
      "25259->Big scratchers and catnip includes | 3 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:7209d8428f4a477d817241841f14470]] Every cat will be different. I have a smaller cat with not a lot of hair who likes to rub on everything. This has bigger scratchers than I was expecting thats a little too hard for smaller cats or cats with not a lot of hair. She was interested at first but I think the size of it is too much and would prefer more but smaller and less tough scratchers.<br /><br />It includes 4 sticky tapes for each one which stick great to the corner of the wall, even taking it off and putting it somewhere else is great. It comes with cat nip that you can put inside it, which is really hard to do. You have to put it through one of the holes on the back and then a lot of it misses the hole, and when you're moving it around it can fall out but then once it's on the wall, the scent doesn't have anywhere to go. It would be better if it had air intakes on the front and a lid to open for the catnip. She was going crazy for it when I was putting it together but after it was on the wall she didn't care, she acted like she wanted to rub against it but didn't and I think that was because of the size of the spikes.\n",

I make lip butters, and I can pass out samples in this small sized pot.<br />They seal tightly... snap on.<br />The only reason I did not give them a five star rating, is because I think they're priced a little high. Great product, though!\n",
      "25314->Good variety of options, not all are great quality. | 3 | 0 | 66 Scrunchies for $7 is a great deal. The value for the quantity is there. I liked that this pack came with scrunchies made from different fabrics so I could try them and see what I liked. It has cotton, chiffon, velvet, and satin. I thought I would be more impressed with the satin and the chiffon, but they look/feel pretty cheap. I didn't expect to like the cotton ones, but those are actually my favorite and they look nicer and better in quality.<br /><br />This comes was a good variety. Fabrics, colors, and designs. Some of the colors and patterns aren't very pretty, but some of them are great colors. The nice part about a package like this is choosing which ones you do like out of it. I passed the bag on to my sister so she could choose some she liked.<br /><br />As for the functionality, I like scrunchies that wrap around my hair twice. These do, but it feels a little tight. I'm hoping that with time they will stretch more so my hair isnt quite as pulled. Maybe if they elastic was slightly bigger I would like these ones more.<br /><br />Overall, still a good product. Still worth the value, but not my favorite Scrunchies.\n",
      "25318->Makes old wrinkly hands look much more youthful | 4 | 0 | As we age, our hands seem to become less plump and pretty and more bony and wrinkled.  The skin is drier and needs moisture more often.  The Shea Butter Rejuvenating Hand Cream does a very good job of restoring a more youthful and moisturized look to my aging hands. The cream is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling at all.  I have used other hand creams that claim to be specifically for very dry hands and they have a thicker consistency. Getting those type creams to absorb takes more work.  This cream manages to do the same kind of good job with a lot less hassle.  I have seen improvement in the skin appearance on my hands and think some of my spots caused by the sun have lightened up.<br /><br />I did deduct a star in my ratings for two reasons, one is that while applying the cream it has (to me) a musty odor on application that does disappear once absorbed.  Secondly, it doesn't last through hand washing as well as other creams of the same basic type.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have no relationship with the seller and the opinions expressed are my own. I am under no obligation to give a good review if it isn't warranted.\n",
      "25334->Pretty Good | 4 | 0 | I've been using this for a few months now. I haven't noticed a dramatic difference in my skin, but it does feel more hydrated during the day. That being said, I sometimes feel like my skin may feel more oily as a result. It does feel softer as well, though.<br /><br />I was really excited to try a night mask because my skin can be quite dry at night and early in the morning. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this, but there isn't a huge dramatic difference.\n",
      "25336->Not as purple as the picture | 4 | 0 | This wig is more black than purple in real life, but I think it looks better that way. It seems to be a nice, high quality costume wig able to fit various head sizes. The tall braid standing up is thick and plump, not likely to deflate or fall over on its own, but it does make the wig a little unbalanced. A real person will be able to compensate easily, but my little foam head here was struggling.<br /><br />This set came with a wig cap, earrings (one had a defect on the \"gem\"), a necklace that was lightweight, a spider clip for the hair, and two braid clips. I wasn't really sure what to do with the braid clips or how to clip them into the hair, as there didn't seem to be any flexibility in the prongs to get hair between them, but some searching revealed that they probably should be twisted up around the braid. I did that, as pictured, and you can see how I was able to hide the way the main braid was held in place with a rubber band at the end.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fun little set that I think a fan of the movie Hocus Pocus will get a laugh at. It might not be the most faithful recreation, but if you don't have the time or skills to make this hairstyle for yourself, it will suit a cosplay nicely.\n",
      "25346->Tangles and is thin | 1 | 0 | First day of my sew-in was okay<br />Then the next day and days after that it was non stop tangling. I brushed and flat iron it but that didn’t save it. Didn’t want my money goin to waste so I left in it a ponytail for a whole month<br />TERRIBLE HAIR\n",
      "25356->Product separates in the tube... | 3 | 0 | These facial whips are a nice addition to my blush collection, but they're not good for everyday use. The colors are nice and blend in well, but the two peach/neutral ones are much lighter than I expected (although I find that to be the case with most elf cosmetics so I should have expected that!). The tubes are TINY but a little dab goes a long way, so they seem to be a fair price. These whips add a nice glow to my cheeks that is great for date night with my hubby or going to a party or other event, but I would not use them on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the product separates in the container, so you have to shake it up REALLY well before you squeeze a little out onto your fingertip or makeup sponge. If you don't shake it (and even when you do half the time), you end up with a gush of shimmery liquid dripping over your finger before any of the actual color squirts out. Most of the &#34;shimmer&#34; in these shimmering facial whips has ended up in my sink rather than on my face. If the product didn't separate like that and didn't need to be shaken like the dickens before use, then this would be a five star product in my book. As it is, these are lucky to get a three.\n",
      "25360->Favorite conditioner since i finished chemotherapy. | 5 | 0 | I honestly feel that Shea Moisture Hemp Seed Oil Length Conditioner and its matching shampoo have definitely improved my hair growth and thickness following Chemotherapy. My hair has always been slow growing, so a few inches after a year is fast for me though YMMV. I find the conditioner is nourishing, without being too heavy or allowing fly-aways. Less is more with this conditioner as well, as a bottle lasted me a year, but I was bald to start; again, YMMV.<br />This three-pack was definitely an excellent value for the money, especially with Prime shipping.\n",
      "25379->Comparable to the basic Waterpik portable with a few improvements and extras | 4 | 0 | This unit is comparable to my very basic travel Waterpik flosser. In fact it has several features that the basic model lacks for around the same price. This unit has three speeds, whereas the entry level Waterpik only has one. The fastest speed is comparable with the one speed on my Waterpik, and it’s the only speed I need. This unit has a charge light (blinks until charged) while there is no such light on the comparably priced Waterpik. This device has about the same sized reservoir as the Waterpik, but because of the design, it’s on the bottom as opposed to along the sides of the unit, the result being that it makes it a lot bulkier, which is unfortunate in a travel water flosser. Unfortunately, there is no advantage to this design as like the Waterpik, it begins to stop pumping water as the tank gets lower, forcing the user to keep the unit vertical in order to get to the water at the very bottom of the reservoir, which can become quite awkward while trying to get around the teeth and gums. I’ve owned several of these, and to be fair, they all suffer from this same problem.<br /><br />One more thing: this unit comes with a nice case and a stash of attachments (which are usually found in home units and don’t generally come with portable units ,) none of which I have much use for, but I guess it’s good to know they’re there. It does include two of the standard water flosser adaptors, so two people can use it.<br /><br />The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this puppy will last. This is my 3rd travel water flosser. I’ll report back should something ontoward occur, or if it continues to work well.\n",
      "25396->excellent product | 5 | 0 | Wow, This is a great value for an argon comb. We used it on an inflamed spot of skin that hadn't responded to the &#34;orange color&#34; light or any anti-inflammatory potions  that usually work. The inflammation subsided about 50% in just the first 24 hrs.<br />It arrived very quickly & in perfect shape.  We're ordering more.\n",
      "25397->thin, light weight lotion that is perfectly rich. Makes for instantly supple, radiant, soft skin | 5 | 0 | I really like this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion. I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps). ALL that I have tried by Organa Cell has been gentle, no discernable scent, absorbs well, and feels good on the skin. Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases. Take my money, haha<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.\n",
      "25400->Gold Themed Beauty Box | 4 | 0 | This \"facial kit\" has all the items you'd expect to get in a spa gift basket, only it's shipped in a cardboard box reminiscent of subscription boxes. The main difference is that it's a one-time deal, no subscription needed, and all the items are grouped together by theme and color. I ordered the \"gold\" theme and was a little disappointed that not all the items are gold colored (the eye mask is blue) and there's a mix of drugstore items with some more luxurious feeling ones.<br /><br />I'll start with the good. The box is very cute, with the words \"It's a great day to love your face\" greeting you when you open the box. Inside you get a five count box of sheet Masks that contain retinol, a generous and thick box of facial wipes, a Gold under-eye pad to reduce lines and puffiness, and a gold Lip Mask (I've never used a \"lip mask\" before so this seems a little bizarre, if fun). The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the \"facial buff\" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  \"facial cleansing brush\" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed. This one wasn't, so if I were giving this to someone as a gift, I'd certainly add it so the items wouldn't arrive in a jumble. But otherwise, I liked it.\n",
      "25450->Great exfoliating cleanser - not too harsh!! | 5 | 0 | I love to change up my cleansing product.  I had never tried any product such as this, so was excited to try it.<br />It arrived quickly.<br />I love the exfoliating properties.  Some are very harsh, but this product is just right!!  And it takes very little to cleanse.  I use this twice a day.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I really can't describe how much I love this product.  One of the best facial cleansers I have ever tried...and I've tried a lot.  I know you won't be disappointed when you try this!!\n",
      "25451->Stinky | 1 | 0 | Initially it smells good, but then it turns into this all day bizarre aroma. Made me start to feel like I had to cough even, definitely related to this.<br />Certainly no difference in beard texture/softness observed though.\n",

I emptied the bottle, allowed it to dry out for 3 days reloaded it and still it does NOT Mist and the drips just keeps coming even when handle is released. Nothing seems to be broken or loose inside, so I will look for another brand\n",

      "25502->Never Knew My Feet Could Be So Soft! | 5 | 0 | My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment! (I told my mom about my success and she already ordered one of herself !lol )<br /><br />Photos:<br /><br />#1-wearing the 'socks', #2- day 2, #3-day 4, #4-finished<br /><br />Day 5\n",
      "25524->Maybe I’m doing it wrong | 2 | 0 | I was excited about the idea of using this product, but not so excited about the results.  Somehow my hair came out totally unmanageable.<br />Could just be me.\n",
      "25528->They are ok | 2 | 0 | I installed these on Sunday and today is Wednesday and they are super matted and frizzy at the ends! They shed like crazy and I did treat the hair before installation.<br /><br />They are relatively soft and light though.\n",
      "25531->Cute scrunchi! | 5 | 0 | I’m a long time scrunchi gal and I always have one in my hair or around my wrist. The invisibobbi scrunchi isn’t your ordinary elastic band covered in fabric; it is one of those swirly-do/keyring spirally things inside of the fabric. Is there much difference? In my opinion no not really but I like the fabrics these come in as they’re all super cute. I personally LOVE the black velvet as it matches most everything. I like using these over standard rubber bands as they don’t kink my hair like a rubber band would. I have thick and long hair (hangs to the middle of my bra)  and these hold my hair up in a top knot or ponytail pretty well. I have tested using it while doing Pilates and I had to adjust it a couple of times but for normal activity it holds up great. Finally it does stretch out to accommodate thick hair and wrap a couple times around but it returns to<br />its original shape and doesn’t stay stretched out (I’ve had that issue with elastic band scrunchi where they get stretched out and unusable). Also the scrunchi Ed comes in a nice little box and this would make a cute part of a gift basket or stocking stuffer!\n",
      "25546->Be patient, practice and enjoy | 5 | 0 | I like the ease of doing my nails to the length I want without having to form nail. I also like the ease of doing both hands when normally doing my right hand is harder being I am right handed so working with my left hand is difficult.<br />It does take time getting use to consistency so be patient.\n",
      "25614->Not for thick hair | 3 | 0 | I bought this for holding a casual up-do, but it doesn’t even hold my ponytail. If the tension bar didn’t extend up so high this would be much more versatile. I’ll keep it for half up styles, but it’s pretty disappointing. The overall barrette size looks better with ponytails and other styles, but the capacity is deceptively skimpy. Definitely not for volume. I considered cutting out the tension bar, but am afraid it’ll ruin the whole closure mechanism.<br /><br />Update: my husband was able to squeeze the tension bar in the middle (see photo), thankfully it didn’t snap. This gives me room for all my hair. Rating upgraded from 1 star to 3\n",
      "25656->100% useless and enormously overpriced | 1 | 0 | Using this product made 0 difference. Zero!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Amica, I love their hair spray and dry shampoo but this product is a complete waste of money.\n",
      "25659->First don't buy full retail, there are deals all over the internet ($79) | 3 | 0 | So, I tried it.  I'm a big fan of the milk cleanser and moisturizer, so I was excited to try this firming mask.<br />Well, it's actually more of a moisturizing mask, skin is super hydrated after use.  Instructions say not to wipe it off,<br />but rather rub it in.  Once it dried I felt a sight tighting but it didn't last. maybe after I use all 6 I will see a difference??<br />It says use once or twice a month.  I'm sure I won't repurchase.\n",
      "25679->1/4 and 3/4 | 3 | 0 | I was so excited to get these.  I opened the bag, counted them to make sure there were 30.  I also separated them from what I would use and what I probably won't and while doing that, I found that roughly 3/4 of them are in good shape and the other 1/4 are not cut deep enough to get a mold piece.  (And yes, the ones that don't look cut well, I tried them out to make sure they just weren't suppose to be cut deep enough.  Well, those ARE suppose to be cut deeper than they are.)  Because of this I don't think they're really worth the price of $15.  It's a shame the seller doesn't make sure their product is top notch.  The designs are cute, the material is easy to release the mold designs and vey easy to clean.  Therefore, if not for the ones that aren't cut well, this would be well worth the price.<br /><br />Because of the positive things I mentioned, I gave this review 3 stars.  But, for recommending these, I'm On the fence.  If you don't mind a few to half not being usable, then yes, I recommend taking your chances with ordering these.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you shop around a little more for better quality and guarantee of the product.\n",
      "25681->Definite NO from me | 1 | 0 | Pros: none I can think of<br /><br />Cons: strong chemical smell. my skin somehow rejected the liquid inside this hand mask...it wasn't absorbing into my skin. I took the gloves off after 30 minutes and I tried to massage the liquid into my hands but instead of being absorbed into my skin it was creating a white creamy and sticky mess all over my hands. I thought maybe my hands were just too dry and the dry skin was creating a barrier?!? so I took some of the liquid and tried to rub it on my arm and leg and it still wouldn't absorb. The sticky feeling started getting to me and the smell became overwhelming so I ended up washing it all off. My hands felt drier than before I started but felt like they had some kind of chalky film on them.<br /><br />I work in healthcare and my hands are very dry from washing and sanitizing all day long so I'm constantly searching for ways to pamper my hands since they take a beating. I've used lots of different hand masks and have never experienced this before from any of them. So, NO, I do not recommend these. Hard pass.\n",
      "25708->Very simple yet flirty | 4 | 0 | These headbands are pretty nice.  I only have one bad thing to say about them.  The ends of the bands (which are wrapped in coordinating colored cloth which is awesome!) is squared.  This makes the ends of the bands - the actual edge of the cloth) poke at my ears and head when removing them.  Putting on was not a problem as I seem to be more careful.  Not sure if you are truly running around and active where they may continue to poke you through the day - have not worn mine long enough yet - and today is a calm day anyway.  Not sure why they made the pretty end so squared...<br /><br />Otherwise these headbands are very nice. Nicer than I though they would be.  I actually thought they may look far too childish but in actuality they are very nice looking - simple yet flirty.  They do not look infantile in any way.  They also fit pretty well and are comfortable to wear - except for the pokey bottoms.  I also thought that the colors would be an issue as I am not much of a pastel person but because they are thin it really is not an issue.  I think they will go along with a lot of clothes - even if it picks up just a hint of a color that you may have on.  Plus - even though the ends are uncomfortable - I LOVE that they are finished with the same exact color - most bands take the cheap way out and finish all the colors in black or something.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the \"helpful\" button.

      "25710->Poor workmanship for such an expensive hair dryer. | 1 | 0 | Owned this for less than 5 months, then the thing literally started to fall apart!  Shocking, since it was so pricy!  I've bought cheaper ones that lasted for years.  I have to say it worked great though, until the plastic starts to break apart.<br />Too bad, because it worked great, lots of power and dried my hair really fast.\n",
      "25721->Gel terrific, regular polish ok. | 4 | 0 | The gel is 100% fantastic ! Needed 3 coats but this is common with lighter colors.<br />The regular polish is fair. Watery, cracked and chipped quicker than usual.\n",
      "25751->cap was cracked when I opened that package and leaked over the bottles. | 1 | 0 | I love this product have used it for years.<br />When I opened the package it was covered with shampoo because the cap was cracked and it leaked all over both bottles.<br />The shampoo bottle was the one that was cracked, the conditioner bottle was fine.<br />So now I do not have a pump cap for the shampoo bottle.\n",
      "25772->Don't care for the bottom brown/orange color. | 4 | 0 | Dark powder does not blend very well and is too orange for my taste. I should have known better that shimmer works best for highlight, not as the dark contour powder anyway. Depotted, and just use the two lighter powders.<br /><br />Love the two powders for subtle vs dramatic highlight powder, especially for under brows. Worth it for those two.\n",
      "25774->Not much difference | 2 | 0 | I won't say they didn't work at all, but they barely made any impact on my hooded eyes. The more droopy of the two was made about equal to how the other appears when without any tape, and the less droopy didn't exhibit much change at all. These probably work best if you have shallow eyes, but mine are rather deep set.<br />Went through several tapes just trying to find the best place to place them, and I found these seem to get better results being placed below the crease or even low on the eyelid.<br />I will say they are almost invisible, and they stay put very well. But they didn't do anything very worthwhile for me.\n",
      "25812->Very nice shampoo, small bottle that surprised me a little though | 4 | 0 | I was a bit surprised how small the bottle of shampoo was since it costs almost $20. But I admit the shampoo itself is very nice. First of you will notice how fantastic it smells. It produces a very nice lather that distributes beautifully throughout your hair. I let it sit in for a little bit since it is supposed to help you with your hair, making it thicker and richer.<br /><br />It rinses out with ease leaving your hair squeaky clean. I do follow it with a conditioner but overall my hair did look and feel fantastic when I use this shampoo. When you use it you don't need a lot of it so thankfully this bottle should last you a good amount.\n",
      "25830->Got a perfect color match with decent coverage | 4 | 0 | I included a half make-up, half naked skin photo, taken with my phones portrait filter off, to give you some sense of how this foundation looks.<br />I was fortunate in that the time I spent studying the shades on the product page paid off with a pretty spot on color match for my skin, which had me very excited.<br /><br />Regarding how the make-up went on, I actually found I got better results applying it with my finger than I did with the included make-up sponge.<br />I know using a sponge is better for your skin, but I found it just kept blending the foundation right off my face.<br />Whether that was a result of how I applied it, the foundation itself, and/or the sponge is up for debate.<br />Since you get two sponges included with the two bottles of make-up, you can experiment and decide what application method works best for you.<br />Side note, this is way too thick to be air brushed on and can't be diluted, so if you use an airbrush, this foundation probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Regarding how the foundation looked and felt, I would say, standard.<br />This reminded me of pretty much every good quality foundation I have ever tried.<br />- It looks best after you first put it on<br />- It covers many, but not all marks and discoloration<br />- As the end of the day approaches, it starts to look \"fatigued\"<br />- It will wipe off on hands, clothing, etc... if you rub your face<br />- You need to put some effort into getting all traces of the foundation cleaned off at the end of the day<br />- For best results, you'll probably want to pair it with a spot concealer and finishing powder<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid foundation that performs well, but is not exceptional.<br />If you get a good match to your skin tone like I did, I suspect you will be very pleased with this make-up set.<br />In the end, I would definitely recommend this, so long as you understand this is not the ultimate fix all your problems, find your prince, do your taxes, and make you smarter miracle in a bottle all foundations claim to be, but instead, a quality make-up that will give you good coverage.\n",
      "25839->braid extension | 2 | 0 | For the price it was ok except the color was not quite close enough ...cost more to ship then the item itself.<br />Quality was definitely not upscale...but would be ok for a costume party or something like that...if I wanted<br />a better quality I would go to a local hair piece store.\n",
      "25847->Great for Washing Hands | 4 | 0 | There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.\n",
      "25873->Huge itchy bumps develop into huge itchy pimples | 1 | 0 | There's something in this mask that causes my forehead (mostly but not exclusively my forehead) to break out in large red itchy bumps.  I've tested it six or seven times to make sure it couldn't be something else coincidentally causing those bumps and it's definitely this product.  I use it in the morning and by that afternoon the bumps/itchiness have started.<br /><br />I use quite a few different mud masks without issue.  I have another brand of manuka honey mask...no problems.  There's either something in this particular mud that disagrees with me or else the combination of the two ingredients seriously aggravates my skin.<br /><br />The mask goes on well and feels OK while it's on the face but I've never noticed any good reaction to say that its effectiveness is impressive.  It's a mud mask.  Unfortunately for me, it's a mud mask that isn't destined to be used.\n",

      "25898->but I did note that my mascara was going on better - making my lashes appear longer | 3 | 0 | I used this product for 8 weeks.  The packaging indicated I would see a difference as early as 2 weeks, with its full effects seen in 6 weeks.  At two weeks, I didn't 'see' a difference, but I did note that my mascara was going on better - making my lashes appear longer.  This continued to be the case, even after 8 weeks of use: my eye lashes, without mascara, did not appear longer, but with the assistance of mascara and the serum, the lashes appeared  a little longer at the outer edges of the eye (not the lashes of the inner eye).<br />Note: the serum can only be used on the upper eyelid lashes, not on the lower lashes.  Also, if too much serum is applied to the upper lid, it can seep into the eye and cause burning.\n",
      "25918->Moisturizes nicely | 4 | 0 | This cream is very moisturizing. It feels a bit decadent to be honest. It's a light green and not quite as cucumber-y as I would like. The cucumber smell is there but it's more delicate than another cucumber cream I have on hand.<br />It's silky smooth, goes on easily and is very quickly absorbed. It is pricey, but it makes my skin feel soft and supple.<br />It's especially good on some tough spots--neck and elbows.\n",
      "25919->Decent mascara but VERY hard pokey applicator! | 3 | 0 | I have pretty long and decently full eyelashes so this mascara worked well for me as a daily mascara.<br /><br />Cute packaging, nice slim shape with cute design.<br /><br />I didn't find it to be too volumizing, but it does a good job at defining and lengthening.<br /><br />Formula was not very wet from first opening so this may dry out faster than others if not used up.<br /><br />My main issue with this mascara is the hard plastic applicator. It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already. The bristles just seem really hard and sharp!<br /><br />This could just be me having a problem for whatever reason, but thought I'd mention.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!\n",

I am a breast cancer survivor, and have more than my share of scars, so any help in healing is very welcomed!<br /><br />I am not going to include photos until I have completed testing it for a month or longer to give it time to see if it works as promised, but I am giving a review of it so far. It arrived in great condition, and the bottle is easy to pump out the cream. The cream (I think it should be called lotion since it comes out of a pump though) is nice and light with a pleasant smell, and leaves the area nice and smooth.<br /><br />Time will tell as to the effectiveness it has on scars and stretch marks since it it still early in my testing, so I plan to return to update my review later and will include before and after photos as well.<br /><br />in a nutshell: so far, so good\n",

      "26024->Decent Set! | 4 | 0 | This set of different Keratin based bottles is pretty nice for the price. It arrived safely and is packaged well. They even included a Carbon Pick Comb that’s great for some thick hair.<br />  I can’t speak on the ingredients that I saw were a concern in another view but, it’s helping us and it makes the hair look good.\n",

I expect to see some bristles work their way out as time goes on.  The last couple of months there have been a lot of bristles \"left behind\" in the shaving soap mug every day - I'd guess 3 - 15 / day.  At this rate, I'm expecting I'll need a new brush relatively soon - disappointing since I paid almost a hundred $$$ for this brush (the most I've ever paid).<br /><br />My last brush (before this one) lasted over 20 years of daily use - and this one was a cheapie I had picked up in a local drug store on a whim.  I don't see this one lasting that long.\n",

Cause it's a really cool idea...<br />[...]\n",
      "26054->Plush but pricey! | 3 | 0 | These scrunchies feel very plush and soft. They came individually wrapped also, in case you want to add them when making gift baskets or something. The colors are also beautiful. I sometimes like to wear them on my wrist ( as a fancier version of an elastic). The other good part is that they’re kinder to hair compared to normal elastics/ hair ties because don’t pull hair out whilst removing.<br />The only downside to these is that they appear quite pricey for $25.99 for a pack of 6. I wouldn’t personally pay that much for a pack of 6 as it isn’t affordable for everyone.\n",

It his very good with making different style using the hair as you can see in the picture I have posted I did a half crochet curly hairstyle with braids at the top using the crochet hair.<br /><br />After just a week the crochet was really tangled especially in the back. It was great for the entire week and then that's when the hair starts to tangle. I even tried using certain products on it to help keep it from tangling more but before the end of the second week I had to take it out.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this hair because it got too tangles quickly and only lasted em the week even after wearing a head scarf and bonnets to keep it form getting dried out and tangled.\n",
      "26067->I haven't found a place to buy replacement heads when needed. | 1 | 0 | This Women Ultra Smooth Razor works well. It glides smoothly and cuts great. My problem is I don't see a place to buy replacement heads only razor blades. Instructions say to replace the blade every two months.<br /><br />The pack comes with a base, handle, and two razor heads. The razor heads have covers on them and they are magnetic. There are instructions but it does not say where you can buy replacement heads.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Women Ultra Smooth Razor to family and friends.\n",
      "26069->Didn’t look anything like that pic | 1 | 0 | I bought this back in 2018 or so because the wig looks so beautiful but what I received was nothing like the picture. It was extremely thinner, shorter and didn’t have the beautiful colors and didn’t even was the gorgeous style depicted.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. Also it she’d a lot and got tangled up easy and wouldn’t stay in place .\n",

      "26096->I'm not sold on all the hype. | 2 | 0 | been wanting to try this soap based on all the ratings and reviews wherever i search on this brand. For me, however, it just didn't live up.<br /><br />Foremost at my disappointment is that the lather is not stable for me (is it because i shave in the shower and the heat/moisture breaks it down?). I have it in a safe corner where water doens't drop into my bowl.<br /><br />Secondly, it's just not that slick or slippery so I don't find it very protective or good for shaving. I shave my head and often have to switch to another soap when I start doing that- otherwise I scrape a lot using this soap on my head. I also feel the blades much more and have more nicks when i use this soap over my other soaps- even cheap soaps.<br /><br />So that this is a high-end costing soap adds to the disappointment. Heck, i even like Porasso more than this and I'm not a fan of Porasso.<br /><br />So not sure- but it didn't live up to the hype or close with me.\n",

      "26143->Nice, but not my favorite fragrance and a bit overpriced | 4 | 0 | This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.\n",
      "26169->Super attractive clippers and file in a leather look case. | 4 | 0 | I really loved the modern look of these clippers and file; however, i took one star away as the small nail file is not as sharp as I would have liked. I'm used to an old Revlon diamond file that works much faster.<br />As others have said, you can very easily remove the black base on the nail clippers if it seems unwieldy to you. It felt just fine to me.\n",
      "26185->Efficient but causes tangles | 2 | 0 | July 2016 - This hair dryer has two settings - low and turbo. I find when I have it set on high and my hair is mostly dry it causes it to tangle which is not a problem I've ever experienced with a hair dryer before. That being said, it does dry my hair very quickly. I have long, thick, straight hair and it probably takes about 10 minutes (including the time I have to spend brushing out the tangles it causes). Overall it's a decent dryer especially for the cost (I got it on sale during Amazon Prime day).<br /><br />Edit: March 2017 - Less than a year later and the dryer now makes a grinding noise every time I turn it on. It also has a burning smell and I do not feel safe using it anymore\n",
      "26208->Love it, but it won’t stay | 3 | 0 | I wanted to see if I could wear these<br />Every once in a while to mix things up. However not sure if it is my hair, but it won’t stay in. It slides through. Great idea and wish it would have worked.\n",
      "26231->Heavily fragranced, but does have a brightening effect | 2 | 0 | Overall, I liked this sheet mask but I would not buy it again because it was so heavily fragranced that I couldn’t bear it for more than 5 minutes. This mask is the first mask I’ve seen which contains kaolin clay. You leave the mask on like any other sheet mask, but after you take off the mask, you can see a thin layer of gray clay on your face. You have to rinse that off.  After I rinsed off the mask and applied my usual Cerave cream moisturizing cream, I felt that my skin looked noticeably brighter.<br /><br />These masks are expensive. They cost $6.00 each (a pack of 5 costs $30.00 on Amazon). Although the two-piece mask fit my face, did not slide off, and is the only sheet mask I know which incorporates kaolin, I found the floral, perfume fragrance overwhelming. A sheet mask should be enjoyable and not make you want to hold your breath.<br /><br />Instead of buying this mask again, I want to try clay/kaolin/bentonite masks and continue to use masks with some of the same ingredients as this mask (e.g., niacinamide (brightens skin but can be irritating for some people), allantoin (soothing), centella asiatica extract (soothing), and dipotassium glycyrrhizate (potential brightening effect)).<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE CLAY MASK: I highly recommend the ISNTREE Real Mugwort Clay Mask* ($23.60 for 3.38 fl oz). There is a strong earthy, herbal scent when you apply the mask, but it disappears quickly. I noticed decreased redness using this mask. It has been more effective than any sheet mask I have tried.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE SHEET MASKS: To brighten skin, try Keana Nadeshiko Rice Mask 10 Pieces Japan** (10 sheets for $9.50). The fragrance free masks contain glycerin (moisturizing), rice ferment filtrate (sake) and rice bran for a skin brightening effect.<br /><br />* https://www.amazon.com/Blackheads-Whiteheads-Moisturizing-Sensitive-Extracts/dp/B07KQYWBP7/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3BHFM1SJVHDQD&keywords=innisfree+clay+mask&qid=1656954243&sprefix=innisfree+clay+mask%2Caps%2C43&sr=8-7<br /><br />** https://www.amazon.com/Keana-Nadeshiko-Rice-Pieces-Japan/dp/B018FM03CO/ref=psdc_11061121_t1_B00IFROMCM<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

      "26234->Great Lashes - Poor Packaging | 3 | 0 | I received these lashes through the Amazon Vine Voice program.<br /><br />The quality of the lashes is fine, and they are easily trimmed and modifiable for a customized look ~ BUT ~ the packaging is NOT what I would expect to receive lashes in a sanitary or protected way. I am referring to the actual manufacturer packaging that holds the lashes. It's a flimsy plastic tray that is NOT sealed NOR sanitary. So you really need to disinfect these lashes prior to use.<br /><br />I hope the company actually reads this review and considers better packaging of their product. Therefore, the 3 Stars is due to the poor packaging. The lashes are fine though.\n",
      "26251->Multi-certified, coarse alum for general use but not what you might expect for a powder | 5 | 0 | Herbs Botanica Alum Powder offers a multi-certified, coarse alum that is good for general use but not what you might expect for a powder.<br /><br />PROS<br />• Appropriate for multiple uses<br />• USDA Organic, vegan, and other certifications<br />• Bag includes recipes for use<br />• Double-packaged with a bag of the alum inside of a paper, resealable bag<br />• Decent value of level of quality<br /><br />CONS<br />• Often, alum is ground to a fine powder. At least half of this alum, however, is like what you would expect of coarse sea salt—not a powder, as described. Get out the mortar and pestle, and you shouldn’t have any trouble making a fine powder for deodorant mixtures, dying, and other common uses. This downside is not significant enough for me to strip away a star, but buyers should be aware of the coarser-than-usual alum.\n",
      "26269->Case if iffy | 4 | 0 | I've needed new tweezers for my fine-haired brows so I was happy to give these a shot.<br /><br />The case closes with a decent snap, but once you remove the bands holding the tweezers closed, you can't close the case with the tweezers inside. That's not a big deal to me as I'm leaving the tweezers out of the case, but you should know that in case you wish to keep these in a makeup bag.<br /><br />These tweezers do a lovely job grabbing onto the fine, thin hairs of my brows. They're \"sharp\" without being pokey and I like the colors.<br /><br />They work for me, and it's nice to keep the small ones in my purse.\n",
      "26279->Excellent Tattoo Aftercare Product | 5 | 0 | The key to having a tattoo that both lasts and looks great for the long term is how it’s cared for during the initial healing process - and this product is perfect to aide in the healing and aftercare.<br /><br />This moisturizing tattoo lotion is the perfect product to use after cleaning your tattoo. This lotion is excellent at hydrating the skin and holding the moisture without being overly greasy as many of other products tend to be.<br /><br />This lotion is far cheaper than many other similar products but I found the quality superb.  This lotion is much cheaper than what you’ll find at many tattoo studios but every bit as good.<br /><br />Having a vibrant, great looking tattoo requires properly caring for it through the healing process and after. This lotion is all you need to help your piece of art look great for a lifetime.<br /><br />You’ll never regret this purchase.\n",

      "26299->Smells nice, but... | 2 | 0 | ...the packaging looks like its designed for the 99 cent store or Dollar Tree. There is no visible label that says these flowers are certified organic, just a worn out sticker with a generic description. The flowers themselves look old. I wouldn't be surprised if these were bought in bulk years ago and packaged to be resold on Amazon.<br /><br />My purpose for using these (as they said certified organic in the description) was for food, smoking and tea. But as is I'll probably end up just using them for incense now.<br /><br />:-/<br /><br />Oh well.\n",
      "26305->Fine, except for extraction tool | 2 | 0 | I was unable to even once get the extraction tool (one end of each rod) to extract a clogged trap.

The extraction tools on those worked every time.<br /><br />Disappointed.\n",
      "26316->My cat likes it | 2 | 0 | Sending back. teeth are too long. I had one I bought years ago for my golden boy. It took out all that didn't belong in his fur. I bent the teeth by cleaning out a bristle brush and ruin it. I haven't found a comb as good since. This isn't as good as his old comb. It doesn't work as well. I think because the teeth are too long. Better for a dog I think.<br />I kept this comb because I didn't have time to send it back. I used it on my golden boy and it works good after all. I gave it a chance and it takes out fleas and other stuff on his fur. It works good. My boy cat is a short hair orange and tan cat, he loves the comb, he rubs his face against it when I comb his forehead and chest and I am so glad it doesn't have sharp points to hurt his skin under his hair.\n",

      "26358->Smells Great | 2 | 0 | This cream honestly does smell like chocolate mint, but not overpoweringly so.  However, I'm reluctant to use it because the jar is not sealed.  There is a piece of plastic that only sits atop the jar.  In addition, the cream itself has shifted and the top is very uneven and has ridges.  I don't think it's been opened and used because it doesn't quite have that appearance, but the two things combine make me uncomfortable using it.  Another reviewer posted a picture with a review that indicated that she thought her jar had been used and the impressions look as though fingers have been raked through it.  My jar looked similarly, but I don't actually think that's the case - I just think that's the way the product shifted.<br /><br />I would recommend that the manufacturer do something to improve the appearance of the product and/or seal the jar - a tamperproof seal so customers know it hasn't been opened.\n",

It all continues to grow back like it's Sunday morning, and the sun is a-bakin' outside.\n",

      "26380->They do the trick | 4 | 0 | I was pretty disappointed when I first opened them the box was nice and all but the hair felt super thin. Plus I missed where it said these were the thinner strips. It does include 20 though. I was ok applying them with the tape they came with despite the reviews.  in case I hated them, that way they'd be easy to take off. Surprisingly i didn't.  But of course one package isn't enough and the hair looks super thin compared to mine even though my hair is thin to begin with. I did order two which is why i bought them (2 of these equaled 1 at the beauty supply store pricewise). As far as quality they feel ok so far only 24hrs. When I went to curl them I smelled some type of chemical like when they perm hair so that was unsettling. I Hope to post another picture once I apply the 2nd package in my hair. My own hair is pretty long id say 20 in but these being 24 in you can see the difference so hopefully the 2nd pckg will help. I am used to clip ins and taking them off at night so I will not be able to do a 3rd pckg if it doesnt do the thickness I am looking for.<br /><br />Follow up review after wearing for about 3 months they are actually surprisingly good. They dont keep curled as I would like but that's not a deal breaker for me. I have had to reinstall them not all of them but a couple here and there and replace the tape. But the hair blends in with my hair seamlessly and they are easy to brush and maintain.\n",
      "26381->Only good if you like the smell of cedar! | 2 | 0 | I can say I tried it. But I don't like it! Smells very strongly if cedarwood.  If you like rhe smell if cedar, this one's for you.<br />Sadly it is nothing like my much loved LM01.<br />I pray they make it again!!\n",
      "26382->Nice Goodie Bag Filler | 4 | 0 | These made nice party favors for my 4 year-old son's 4th birthday. It was Paw Patrol in theme so these went over well. The variety was nice and the toys, while all cheap plastic stuff, are brightly colored and made nice little gift bags for the kids. If you spread it out, this kit would make goodie bags for maybe a dozen kids, maybe more.<br /><br />I was initially worried about how safe they would be for little kids (nothing kills the groove of a 4 year-old's party like a choking kid) but for 4, they seemed fine with minimal supervision. I don't think I would give these to kids much younger.\n",

With weight loss or weight gain comes stretch marks. I am very happy that I was given a chance to try Luxy Beauty Care's Stretch Mark Cream. I have been religiously using it on my thighs and I can honestly say that I am very happy with the results that I got.

      "26408->Stiff, Little Stretch, Lack Elasticity | 2 | 0 | For years, I have purchased random brands of elastic hair ties whenever I need more, and they have all performed similarly. I assumed that the Minihope Women's Hair Elastic Thick Ties would be just like the rest. Not so much. When I stretched one of them for the first time, they felt stiff and brittle, unlike all of the other elastic hair ties I have used. These stretch to about twice the original size when pulled, while my others stretch to about three times or more than the original size.<br /><br />Stretching a new Minihope Hair Elastic Thick Tie just three times, it did not return to the original size.  I’m guessing these won’t last long, even though they are more expensive than the ties I usually buy.\n",

I have had no adverse reactions and have been seeing results in my forehead (deep lines) as well as next to my eyes and mouth (fine lines). I have a very expressive, default-smiling face and these just took a few years off my face in the span of a fortnight.<br /><br />One negative: the top spins to expose the pump, but pressing the pump spins the top. You have to hold it in place, which can be pretty awkward!\n",
      "26415->Not a bad shampoo but did not notice any thickening of my hair | 3 | 0 | This shampoo is just middle of the road for me. It comes in a bottle that has a little dispense opening on the top, personally I prefer pump dispensers that just make things a lot easier. The bottle itself is actually a bit small, thought it would be bigger especially for the $20 price tag.<br /><br />The smell of it was not bad but also not great. It produced a nice light lather that did a good job cleaning my hair I would say. It didn't feel like it was drying out my hair or anything. I can't say that I noticed any significant improvement on the appearance of my hair in regards of anti thinning. To me it was just a regular shampoo to be honest and for that it was overpriced and the scent not up to par.\n",

      "26449->More vanilla than musk | 4 | 0 | I liked this shower wash. The liquid is thick and feels rich. It produces a heavy lather. I like both musk and vanilla and found this to be a pleasant blend with its emphasis on vanilla.<br />I had no issues with my skin using this.\n",
      "26468->Masculine scent | 3 | 0 | While notes of sea spray and water blossom do evoke the beach, the odd inclusion of \"driftwood\" notes give it a scent that reminds me camp fires.  I don't consider this a feminine scent but it would make a nice men's cologne.<br />Maybe they were going for a unisex scent but for women the addition of notes like orange blossom or coconut might have made it more feminine.<br /><br />Disappointed.\n",

I highly recommend this seller \"Dead Sea Cosmetics\" after having this first class  customer service.<br />Previous review:  I bought this product before at Costco. I was expecting the same quality. The cuticle oil smells rancid.  This used to smell lovely. YUCK. The lotion has almost no smell, so I don't know what is going on. Very, very disappointing. I gave it three stars for what it used to be. What I just got today, I'd give a zero.\n",

I wanted him try something different he's used beard oils and beard balms I wanted to try out this beard conditioner to see how it would work out for him.<br /><br />He didn't like it at all unfortunately, it was heavy on his beard and left a white residue that never absorbed he ended up having to wash his beard he was not happy. I was really hoping it would work out and make his beard nice and soft and fluffy like leave in conditioners for the hair on your head . It doesn't have a scent.<br /><br />He gave it 2 chances each time no success so he decided not to try it again.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review\n",

The white I will be wearing but I will be using nail art paint with it.<br /><br />The box comes with 4 bottles of gel polish. Each bottle has the color of the polish on the top of the cap. There are instructions for how to apply the gel polish.

      "26537->Great hair removal device | 4 | 0 | This definitely works. I have tried all of the different functions and without a doubt it performs perfectly. The device will automatically stop the motor if a large chunk of hair goes through it. I was using the epilator on my leg from a seated position when my hair fell in the way. THANK GOODNESS the motor automatically stopped!!!!<br /><br />The motor is a little loud. Make sure to do a full charge 8-16 hours prior to your first use. After using it about 15-30 minutes it will slow down a little bit and I would recommend charging it some more. With curlier hair I noticed that I had some ingrown hairs a few weeks after use.\n",
      "26542->Great For Guests | 5 | 0 | I ordered these for when I have guests on my eco farm. I'm not a fan of plastic toothbrushes & have been using bamboo toothbrushes for many years now. It is interesting to see folks reaction to these types of toothbrushes. I know I've managed to convert some over to bamboo, but not everyone. The mini toothpaste is nice & minty, providing a good, refreshing cleaning.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.\n",
      "26548->Oral-B (4000) rechargeable electric toothbrush | 4 | 0 | I noticed that the battery in the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I've had for two years seems to be wearing down as it will start laboring even before the battery icon starts to blink, indicating it needs to be charged.  So, I decided to order a new one before my old one dies completely.  This is a little different as a red light blinks when you turn it on/off if the battery needs to be recharged.  However, it surprised me because when the  red light started blinking, the brushing was as vigorous as when I had just charged it.  My purchase also qualified for a rebate so am very pleased.<br /><br />JUST TO ALERT PEOPLE WHO SEND FOR THE REBATE - My order came in a brown cardboard box with a large adhesive label with the UPC code - I cut that off (in the bottom left-hand corner of the rebate form, it does say to do that) and sent it in with the rebate form and my invoice - all of that was returned to me with a form letter that stated that the UPC I submitted was \"not valid\" for the rebate offer!  I e-mailed Amazon and they were very nice and credited my card with the $20.  I don't understand what is wrong with the Oral-B people that they are saying I submitted an invalid UPC since that was the only thing on the box!!\n",
      "26559->Horrible plastic materials | 2 | 0 | I want to use this for my photo shoots and I’m extremely disappointed. The materials are extremely cheap, I can honestly make one better by buying $2 worth of flowers and leaves in the dollar store. I know I’m getting plastic garland BUT this is just too cheap for my taste.<br />The color is very dull, nothing like the photo and it is flat. I have to constantly fix it to make it look better and most of the time I am just too annoyed to even use it.\n",
      "26565->Disappointing | 1 | 0 | I had high hopes for this personal blender... I drink a protein shake as a meal replacement for breakfast each morning. I was hopeful that this blender would stir it all up for me. I charged it up and tried it out...  NOPE!<br /><br />It turned on, but barely moves so actual blending didn't occur.  I can't even imagine trying to blend fruit or ice because I was simply using powder and water.<br /><br />Great idea, bad implementation...\n",

      "26587->Great set of ten bands provie lot of flexiblity | 5 | 0 | A nice headband set of headbands made from high quality cotton and have been put together really well.  Strong and stretchy these are very easy to use and do a good job at keeping sweat out of your eyes, or as serving as an accessory when running around.  This set comes with ten, five-inch-wide wicking headbands.  These are wide and I like to fold them over to double up the protection, but I do like the flexibility to make the band the right size for what I am wearing.<br /><br />My order came in really quick and was wrapped within a cellophane bag.  The headbands themselves were additionally wrapped up in their own individual bags. These headbands come in different colors which expands the flexibility to wear with my favorite workout gear. The manufacturer doe provide a 100 percent money back guarantee, but I have been happy with mine based on the softness, their ability to keep sweat and hair out of my eyes in addition to the quality of the material and manufacturing process.  No flaws I can see in any of the five headbands, and they appear that they will last me quite a while.<br /><br />I did receive this product to try out at a discount for my unbiased and completely honest feedback. I do routinely provide feedback on products I try (paid or at a discount) so that other shoppers and friends may avoid some of the not so good choices on products they are looking for while avoiding the bad products. I have found this to be a good product which is comfortable to wear and performs as promised. Please, if you find this review to be helpful to you be sure to hit YES.

So, I just unscrewed the entire top off to use it.  Not really a big issue.<br />The foundation itself is waterproof.  Does last all day with no problem.<br />It's a nice smooth foundation.  Easy to apply with the sponge that comes with this.<br />It does cover up some of the skin flaws.<br />It's an okay foundation for a decent price.  Kept my skin soft all day.<br />Was easy enough to wash off at the end of the day.  I would buy again.\n",
      "26600->A little small for the price | 3 | 0 | Smells decent<br /> small bars<br /> one bar will last me at best 12 to 14 days.<br />For me the value isn't there\n",
      "26618->Nice and compact | 5 | 0 | I like the size of this.  It's nice and small so it's easy to keep in my purse for when I need it.<br />Easy to use.  Just roll on my face and it absorbs any oils without messing up my makeup.<br />Does come with a second ball.<br />Not sure how long the one ball will last since I just started using it.  Seems that it would last quite a long time.\n",
      "26628->Camay | 3 | 0 | The last time I ordered this soap, which I have used since childhood, it was made in Mexico. At another time, it was made in Canada, and a long time ago, it was made in the US. Now it is made in Indonesia. While the quality is no where near what it was when made in the US and Canada, this soap is very similar to what I bought that was made in Mexico. There are some quality control issues, but it works on my skin without making me break out.<br /><br />UPDATE: I ordered a second 9-pack from another seller, and it was NOT the same as pictured or as received from the other seller. It was made overseas (Malaysia? Don't remember) and it was \"sensual scent.\" NOT happy--I expect to receive what is pictured. I returned it.\n",
      "26643->Perfect for Pigtail Buns | 4 | 0 | I have thick, long, straight hair. it's hard to find clips that can hold all of my hair at the store that aren't obnoxiously huge. And these hair claws DID NOT work to create that single neat easy bun look on my head. So I was honestly disappointed in these. it seemed like they were just for those individuals with thin hair. I thought it was the end of these and my money was wasted.<br /><br />However, if you have thick hair like me and you do pigtails, I found that you can use these for two separate buns, and they actually look cute! These things creak a little when opening but overall, they are reliable, reusable, and comfortable. I simply use a comb to split my hair into two even bunches. I use a hair tie on each side and then twist up my hair and use a hair claw to hold it in place in a bun. My buns stay up all-day with a strong hold. I recommend storing them closed in shape to avoid them losing their tenacity and shape.\n",
      "26648->These do not have a 2 oz. capacity as stated | 2 | 0 | These containers seem well made though a thinner material than others.  These are falsely advertised as having a 2oz. capacity.  If you use the removable inner liner it holds only 1.3 oz.  You can leave the inner liner out and get more in it.<br />1.5 to be exact! Hmmmm:(\n",
      "26652->Good package with basic Sonicare toothbrush and Airfloss. | 4 | 0 | This package comes with both the Essense toothbrush and the Airfloss.  The Essence is a a basic Sonicare brush without advanced features.  The brush is perfect for first time Sonicare users who don't want to spend a lot.  The toothbrush will do what you need to keep your teeth and gums in good shape without breaking the bank. The Essence does come with a 2 minute timer, which is a great feature at this price range.  The timer really helps you get all your teeth clean without spending too much time in one area.<br /><br />The Airfloss is a nice way to help your gums if you are not fond of doing regular flossing.  Regular floss is the best way to go but if you are like me and are not good at doing that often, the Airfloss is a great way to go to help improve gum health.  I usually put in a fluoride mouthwash into the floss liquid reservoir and that works well.  I find it easy to move around my mouth with the Airfloss and I can complete the flossing very quickly.<br /><br />For the price of this package, you get a good entry level Sonicare and the Airfloss, both will help with improving your teeth and gum health.  I have been using Sonicare for years and really like them as they improve my dental visits.  If you haven't tried out Sonicare give it a try for better gum health.\n",
      "26670->The logo is very loud | 3 | 0 | While I enjoy the versatility of this product, the logo was very intense and visible on the front of the warmer. It has a pretty blue light that surrounds the bottom when turned on and a great screen to let you know the temperature. I found it heated up very quickly and was an even heat that worked great for wax. I do wish the pot inside was coated or easier to clean between uses.<br />If you do use this warmer for its intended use it works really well to keep massage oil heated for lengthy periods and the knob makes it easy to adjust even if there is product on your hands.\n",
      "26684->Removes Regular (Not Gel) Tough Polish Well, Does Not Leave Nails Parched | 5 | 0 | When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\n",
      "26707->Great alternative polish remover. | 4 | 0 | I really like this nail polish remover.<br />It does seem to take just a little more product to get the job done, but non toxic is totally worth the minimal extra effort.<br />The glass dropper is excellent for applications to a cotton ball or cotton pad.<br />I would definitely recommend this nail polish remover. I'm happy with this product.<br />I have received this product for evaluation purposes.<br />My experience and evaluation are my own and completely unbiased.\n",
      "26709->Terrible, too heavy, impossible to get off | 1 | 0 | This seemed like a great idea, since there is no waiting time to dry.  I thought it was a quick put-on-and-lets-go.<br />But this is just terrible. It feels super heavy on the nails, it clogs under the nail if not applied with absolute perfection and dries as hard as concrete, making it impossible to get off under the nail, as well as removing when you no longer want it.<br />I will use the powder for handcrafts now... seems like a much better use.\n",
      "26729->Good For Length, Clumpy For Volume | 4 | 0 | This mascara is pretty good but its not my favorite.<br />PROS: It doesn't bother my eyes which are very sensitive.  It wipes off easily.  I like the wand.<br />CONS: Requires several layers to provide decent volume and clumps easily after the first layer.<br />It won't replace my favorite daily mascara but it's a decent runner up.\n",
      "26736->Metal tin container is better | 2 | 0 | Not the same thickness as the formula that comes in the container 😔<br />It's very thin = not very moisturizing\n",
      "26781->Playful and Pricey: Check Ingredients | 3 | 0 | This is my first experience using a gel-to-oil cream so I didn't know what to expect, though I hoped it'd leave my skin radiant and glowing (due to the words \"GLOW DAY CREAM\" in the name). *Note: There's no glow whatsoever.<br /><br />When I dip into a little bit of product, it's a shiny lightweight, non-sticky pink gel. As soon as I apply it to my face or to the top of my hand, it melts, spreads with ease, and leaves my skin velvety soft. The absorption rate is fairly quick compared to similar creams and oils, though usually if something is immediately devoured by my skin, there's no evidence it was there; this, however, leaves my skin smooth and without a greasy residue. It can easily be applied prior to makeup if needed. Finally, this gel has a nice medium fragrance that isn't overpowering or lingering.<br /><br />While I do like the heavy glass jar and think it looks nice, it's quite deceiving. With only one ounce of product inside, I have another jar of face cream that's the same size but contains twice the product. And when compared to other options, ingredients are crucial. (I've included a photo from the box.) While I recognize some as being good organic extracts and oils, the majority sound like chemical compounds I've never heard of.<br /><br />Being a mere breath away from 50, I need to factor in sun damage, a depletion of hormones, thinning skin, melanin spots, and overall aging when I decide what's best for my skincare. This product, while moisturizing, simply doesn't make the cut as something I'll order again.<br /><br />CONS STACKED UP:<br />- Only 1 oz of product<br />- Unfamiliar ingredients<br />- Lacking ingredients I look for based on skincare needs<br />- High price-point<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Leaves skin velvety soft<br />- Nice scent<br />- Absorbs well, no icky residue\n",

      "26792->It’s good | 3 | 0 | Good quality, but the one it got made of the wood that has darker area in one side; the decorative side.<br />Not too happy about it.\n",
      "26794->Not quite up to advertising hype | 4 | 0 | This trimmer does a better than adequate job of trimming.  The variable setting feature is easy to use and effective.  The unit is considerably larger than most competitors, and this is a bit of a disadvantage.  Also,<br />the vacuum does not get all clippings, so count of beard trimmings on your counter, in your sink, etc.; not bad but not up to advertising.  Certainly worth the price.\n",
      "26832->The guaiazulene mask does have fragrance. | 3 | 0 | I like guaiazulene, because in Dear, Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream, it soothes my skin. This mask gives me some of that effect, plus the nice hydration of a typical sheet mask.<br /><br />I thought the guaiazulene mask option was free of fragrance. It’s not. It smells of green tea to me. Fragrance in skincare provides no benefit to the skin, and in fact makes you more likely to develop skin allergies to both fragrance ingredients as well as anything else on your skin. People interested in guaiazulene are looking to soothe their skin - meaning it’s already irritated. The last thing it needs is fragrance.<br /><br />Also, the eyeholes are too small, so the mask touched the outside edges of my eyes. Some of the serum in the mask got in my eyes. It stung. But not too bad.<br /><br />Overall, look elsewhere. But if you already bought these, it’s not gonna hurt you to use them up.\n",
      "26847->Eek | 2 | 0 | I ordered the kit that said “fair”. Well my blonde daughter was more of an orange color.<br />So I had to use my personal powder to even it up.\n",
      "26852->A bargain for basic eyebrow brushes! | 4 | 0 | These brushes are great for a more finished look to your eyebrows.  I needed a new one—this package of 8 was an unbelievably low price averaging 87 cents each ($6.99 total for 8 brushes)—so now I have a lot of extras!  I wanted a short handled eyebrows brush to fit in my makeup bag—these are only 4 1/4 inches from end to end—long enough to handle comfortably, and short enough to fit.  They are exactly what I wanted, and great for travel.  They are not the highest quality brushes—one brush has a single bristle out of place, and another has a couple of plastic comb prongs not quite straight—but the price was a bargain, and I have plenty in the pack that are just fine (and the slight issues I mentioned don’t make a difference to that one brush).  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases.  I do that because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope my review helped you.\n",
      "26859->Wish I found it earlier | 2 | 0 | UPDATED REVIEW<br />So, as it turns out - this is a poor everyday soap for me.<br />My bodily acne took a turn for the worst. Scalp blew up (my fault - the product never indicated it was shampoo).<br /><br />For me, it was worth a try, and there is no way of telling if my skin would have been better with just ivory - but it certainly wouldn't have been worse.\n",
      "26863->Great moisturizing lip balm with a touch of color | 5 | 0 | I like that this gives just touch of color while moisturizing when I don’t want to take the time to put on lipstick (lip tint) and lip gloss.<br />I’ve been using this for a few years.\n",
      "26890->I would not buy again | 2 | 0 | Not what I was expecting very loose<br />Have to wrap it around couple times\n",
      "26916->Worth every penny | 5 | 0 | I have tried many face products over the years but nothing has seemed to work. My skin isnt awful, but at 40 years old I feel like I should be done with the occasional breakouts. This cleaner is wonderful. Smells amazing. Bubbles nice on my face and I can feel a slight tingle as it works. Washing it off my feels fresh, clean, and without the tightness or hard feel of other cleaners. Most importantly my face looks great<br /><br />Update 11/2018<br />It has been awhile and I just want to say WOW... I am still using nightly and my face has never looked so good.  Even my husband has mentioned to me how \"fresh\" my face looks. I lather it in and I can feel tingly fresh feeling bubbles. The smell is to DIE FOR.  I honestly think also that this has helped with some fine lines and wrinkles... This maybe the answer ladies (and gentleman) to your skin needs\n",
      "26921->Product pictures should show the item you actually receive | 2 | 0 | The good news is the wig is thick and the quality is as good as your standard decent amazon costume wig. The bad news is it arrives looking nothing like any of the photos on Amazon. It's really not okay to sell an item with pictures that look nothing like the actual item. Sure, show it styled, but have at least one picture of the item people will receive, and make it clear styling is required. And if you really care about your customers, provide some instructions for styling it the way it is shown.<br /><br />Also, gave less stars because the color is different in reality than in the pictures. The blue is more cornflower than cobalt, without the variegation that seems to be in the product pictures.<br />(Sadly missed the return window due to traveling)\n",
      "26922->Way too thin! | 1 | 0 | I have fine and thin hair and usually 10 pairs is enough for my hair, not this time. I do t think 20 would be enough. This means more of the tape by my scalp for less hair overall. I would NEVER but these again to add Le gth or volume. They do hold color well so if you just wanted to add a few subtle streaks of color these would work.<br /><br />**Update**<br />The company contacted me and we have been talking for a few days. They said the factory messed these up and other customers have had the same problem with this batch and color (rooted wavy). Since I didn't want any of their other products, they wanted me to remove this review for a refund (since I used the extensions).  🤦🏻‍♀️ My integrity isn't for sale.\n",
      "26926->Not awesome | 2 | 0 | Smell is just ok, scent doesn’t last, an hour at best.<br />Price was great and it came with two bottles so it’s very disappointing.. because now what am I going to do with it.?\n",
      "26956->Low budget stick | 3 | 0 | Bought this stick to conceal some acne bumps. It goes on easy but there are some issues.<br /><br />It felt oily and could easily be wiped off. Struggled a lot with creasing and bulking on skin.<br /><br />Did have more of a positive experience using under eyes but didn’t like thinks being put on top.<br /><br />It’s good for those who have a yellow undertone of the skin. I have pink undertones but could blend it in to match well.<br /><br />It’s cheap and could be better than others on the price range.\n",
      "26984->Check expiration date. Mine expire in 4 months. | 3 | 0 | I love Easydew and have been using their cleanser, ampoule and efg cream for a while and love this cream as well but the cream I received expire in just 4 month!<br />All other easydew products I got last year(2020) won’t expire until 2023!<br />Korean skincare have 3 years expiration date since manufactured date so all other easydew products I got last year was manufactured on 2020(same year I got) and pretty fresh but this cream is expired in 4 month that means this was made back in 2018....<br />Yes, it’s not expired yet but getting 2018 products when it’s 2021 seems kind of bummer.<br />I only use this cream when my skin feel sensitive or had trouble like pimple and etc and I don’t use everyday but now I feel I have to as it’ll expire in 4 months!<br />Check the date when you receive!\n",
      "26992->Can't say I am a fan, overpriced and not very moisturizing | 2 | 0 | This is an ok face day lotion. It comes in a beautiful pump dispenser however which I personally prefer. It does have some nice ingredients like shea butter and hyaluronic acid.<br /><br />Where it lacks is its scent. It doesn't have a scent that is worth writing home about. I didn't care for it at all and thankfully it doesn't linger on your skin either.<br /><br />When you use this moisturizer it is pretty light but is sticky on your skin when you use it. It does absorb fairly quickly though. My skin just felt ok when I used this. It didn't feel super soft or anything nor did it look anything spectacular. This to me was just a middle of the road kind of moisturizer. Now considering all this and the cost of $63, I just can't recommend this product. I think it is overpriced and for what you get I am just not a fan at all.\n",
      "26997->Beautiful and safe | 5 | 0 | These are beautiful  and will get same again many compliments thank you . Save money and buy these instead of 30 to 50 dollars to have someone do it for you not knowing were they been. I think this point is important<br /> Esp nails because of disease that happen and serious covid related issues\n",
      "27005->Nice variety, seem to be durable | 4 | 0 | At this price, this set is a good value in terms of quantity, variety of styles and sturdiness. I've only had them for a few days so I can't say for sure that they're going to be durable, but I did slam them repeatedly on my tile floors with far more force than with the impact of simply falling, and they're still in tact.<br /><br />I have thin hair and the clips grasp nicely and wear comfortably. They open wide enough that I'm sure they'll work for thick hair, too.<br /><br />The colors were a little off, at least on my monitor. The one that looks gold on my screen is actually a light tan. I will probably never wear it out of the house. It looks awful with my red hair and I can't think of many outfits it would match either. That's why the set loses a star for me. The brownish one is lighter than pictured, too.\n",
      "27023->Not bad | 4 | 0 | It works! I’m not picky about my blow dryers as I barely use them. I like that it has more settings for heat & cooling etc.<br />only dislike is that it feels pretty cheap - not sure how long it will last, but price was right for the quality.\n",
      "27040->Helps when wearing mask all day | 4 | 0 | I work in a school that currently requires everyone to wear masks when on property. These mask brackets have really helped me feel more comfortable to wear a mask all day. I also find it much easier to speak and be heard with this bracket.<br /><br />These are the second set of brackets I have tried and I feel like these fit my face much better than other ones.  It took some getting used to as it doesn’t clip into my non pleated masks and sometimes moves around, but I am definitely liking using these better than nothing.  I have shared extras with coworkers and they have all found them to be helpful.  I would recommend.\n",
      "27041->pleasant scent, dries hands out | 3 | 0 | This tiny bar of soap is just bit enough to try it out (2x1x.5 inches); it's nice if you don't want to invest in a huge bar without trying it or if you want something for travel. I found the fruity scent very pleasant. It was very mild and just left a hint of the smell in the air, but not on my hands.<br /><br />I liked the way the soap felt when using it, but my hands got very rough and dry after just a few uses. I wouldn't use this without applying lotion multiple times a day.\n",
      "27053->Fantastic product - will definitely purchase again | 5 | 0 | This packet is sooooo much better than the last (also Godefroy) eyebrow tint product I used - cheaper, less messy, quicker, and so much easier to use! Long lasting, vibrant eyebrow tinting without any staining.<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars from me.\n",
      "27057->Stunning Quick Fix | 5 | 0 | This review is for the Burgundy Short version of this product, and for reference, my glove size is 7 1/2, or women's large.<br />While it might not be the case for everyone, they included sizes that are a perfect fit. I did not use the smallest, nor the largest nail sizes.<br />The burgundy color is gorgeous.<br />The only filing needed is the very tip.<br /><br />Set does NOT include the adhesive tabs, so remember to have enough on hand.\n",
      "27067->Not for petite eyes/faces | 4 | 0 | Very nice lashes, the magnet parts worked well and the lash quality is very good, lightweight and soft,  but the lashes were a little to wide to fit on my eyelids.  I realized that I have a small, narrow face when I bought glasses recently so I think that explains why these did not work for me.  I thought I could just trim them a little, but then they lost their curve and would not work at all.  Sadly, I had to throw them out. Fortunately I did not spend much on them.<br />So I think these would work fine for you if you do not have a small, narrow face like me.  Also, it does take a little practice to get the hang of putting these on. I hope that makes sense and helps you make your decision.\n",
      "27075->Great for thick hair! | 5 | 0 | The clear clip had a gold tint to it - which I LOVE!<br />I have thick shoulder length hair and these clips hold my hair in really well!<br />The middle hair tie color is like a brown grey combo.\n",
      "27089->Useful but finish lacks lustre | 3 | 0 | This product arrived with a white coating on the finish. Scribed it and<br />Most came off but I did not like it. Disappointed!<br />Storage capacity is adequate.\n",
      "27100->Impossible to Put On - Scam Lashes? | 1 | 0 | These are a scam. They look pretty in the box and packaging but they are not possible to actually wear. I’ve purchased 3 pairs of magnetic lashes in a year’s time and watched countless tutorials on how to get them on. I’ve not seen anyone get magnetic lashes on with any kind of ease or practicality. These lashes, like so many others, feel like a scam. I will not ever buy them again and I’m looking at a return because it’s a lie. They don’t really work. Just a box of false hopes like the others.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY and get lash extensions. Magnetic lashes seem like a scam because most are a scam.\n",

      "27134->A very poorly-designed product that does the job. | 2 | 0 | What a terribly designed device! Whoever drew it has likely never used it.<br /><br />The device's neck CURVES INWARD, plus the roller is only PARTIALLY EXPOSED, about 1/3 of its surface when it could be 2/3 or more. It makes roller very inaccessible. You have to hold this thing at a very specific, AWKWARD ANGLE, which makes its usage frustrating, always having to reposition and switch hands.<br /><br />Yes, it scrapes dead skin away. But it's not as strong as a proper corded one. Mind you, even with the cable plugged in, if the device is turned on, the battery is NOT CHARGING.<br /><br />The two rollers it comes with are NOT COARSE like in the description. It takes quite a while to remove dead skin and the &#34;shavings&#34; coming off are/is actually a super-fine powder, finer than flour, almost like smoke, that floats through the air.\n",
      "27154->Smooths, Strengthens and Glosses Each Strand | 5 | 0 | Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo has the wonderful fresh scent of an apple orchard. It is moisturizing like a cream shampoo and in combination with the conditioner these products smooth, strengthen and gloss each strand.<br /><br />After the first use I could feel how my hair was thickening and getting stronger. But by the third use of both the shampoo and the conditioner I could really tell a difference.<br /><br />I love the scent and how it makes my hair endure styling, blow drying and straightening. Your hair will be shinier too. I love these products as much as LUSH shampoos and conditioners and that is saying a lot!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "27161->Great quality! | 5 | 0 | I'm a sucker for dramatic lashes & these take the cake: the perfect balance of drama & functionality. Like with majority of my lashes, I use scissors to snip the ends.. then they're perfect for me to wear. There's an occasional lash that you might have to pull out of it, but they don't shed when you're wearing them. Because there are so many lashes glued into each strip, I get why you might have the occasional straggler. Not a big deal for the price.<br /><br />Remember that one episode of Spongebob where he used his lashes to brush the sand off of an ice cream cone at the beach? Pretty sure you could do that with these if you tried hard enough. Amazing.\n",
      "27168->It works. | 4 | 0 | Depending on the saturation of your color it does the job well enough. I needed it to get out green. I'm on the 2nd treatment and will need one or two more. Green is the worst to get out it seems. But originally it was supposed to be a blue teal but it immediately went to green. I tried a lot of different things since the hair dressers near me have been booked solid for 2 months now.<br />So this stuff works, be patient, leave on more than 20min. The directions are sooo tiny. Mix both together, same amount each bottle. Mix into hair. Leave on 20 to 40minutes. It will probably burn ur scalp.<br />Also it smells like freaking chemicals and vomit. Have a strong stomach, the smell is aweful.\n",

      "27209->Nice cream with a light that just alright | 3 | 0 | I've used many of avajar's products in the past mainly their sheet mask and v-line mask. Generally i'm a fan of their products because many of them work well with my combination skin type. This one was a bit disappointing though. While the cream itself works as a good moisturizer and is slightly thicker on your face (the moisture once it absorbs into your skin does a pretty decent job).<br /><br />The LED light just seems like a gimmick and I didn't really see any extra results while using it. Overall that part seems like a hassle overall.\n",
      "27210->Nice smooth glide and large head makes for easy work | 4 | 0 | The Maybuy Professional Hair Clippers/Beard Trimmers comes with 3 attachments, 1/2 inch, 1 inch and 1.5 inches.  These attachments simply clip onto the head of the trimmer.  You also get a small brush for cleaning the trimmer and a charging cable which strangely is a USB to Mini-USB even though at the bottom of the trimmer is your standard two prong charging connector.<br /><br />Being able to charge this via USB however is great for when you need to go on holiday/vacation as you always have some kind of USB charging device with yourself (usually for your phone).  On a full charge the clippers will roughly 2 hours and are small enough to just throw in your toiletry bag.<br /><br />The trimmer itself has a nice shape to it and is comfortable to hold in your hand.  It also has a fairly nice heft to it, not too light but not heavy.  It feels like you are really holding on to something though.<br /><br />The head is fairly wide which can be a plus in that it doesn't take long at all to trim an area but can also be a bit of a minus depending on the shape of your face if you are trimming your beard.  The action is smooth and has a nice gliding feel to it, even if you don't use any attachments and just use the trimmer head itself.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the Maybuy came with some sort of carrying case to put it, the attachments and the charging cord in but it doesn't unfortunately. The attachments do come in a small Ziploc bag.<br /><br />Overall a nice trimmer, nice action and makes quick work whether trimming your beard or hard to reach places like around your ears.\n",
      "27242->they're pretty decent. These aren't actual rooster feathers | 4 | 0 | For what these are, they're pretty decent. These aren't actual rooster feathers, they are synthetic hair with dyed banded stripes on them. I use them to add some color to wigs that I wear and they look fantastic. The loop tool and beads are nice and if you install them correctly you cannot see the beads even though they are dark.<br /><br />I did have to trim the bonded end to get them to lay correctly, but not a huge deal at all. I almost prefer these over the real feathers as these are easier to fluff out and blend into hair and it's easier to comb through your hair with these in. Just hold the extension at the bead so you don't pull it out when combing that section of your hair. If you have a younger kid that wants feathers in their hair, I'd suggest using these instead.\n",
      "27260->Great toothbrush at a great price. | 5 | 0 | This is really a nice toothbrush, especially for the money.  It’s very well made and pretty on my sink.  My teeth feel super smooth and clean after I brush for 2 minutes with this brush.  Very happy.<br /><br />It would probably be a better value if they sold replacement heads for this brush, but even if you consider the price you pay per brush head with the brush, the price of this can’t be beat.\n",
      "27268->Human hair, low price, not bad! | 3 | 0 | I purchased this hair to add to my locs and to make loc extensions. When it arrived I was immediately disappointed when opening the package, the hair was yellow and looked plastic. I tried the burning test and it did burn as human hair does, but it was going up fast almost as if whatever was on the hair was flammable. I immediately washed the hair with purple shampoo and it turned out beautifully! After washing I was happy, it wasn't yellow anymore and burn testing again confirmed it was human hair and it had lost that coating the seemed flammable. It has a very nice curl pattern after letting air dry. I bought the 30 inch and I will say that it was disappointing how thin the ends were. Normally hair will thin out at the ends some but this bundle the ends were extremely thin.<br /><br />Pros: Good price, long length, actually human hair, colors nicely, turns to a beautiful platinum after a purple shampoo, nice curl pattern (kind of like beach waves)<br />Cons: yellow color (removes pretty easily though), seems flammable before being washed, extremely thin ends<br /><br />Because of the cons I couldn't give this hair 5 stars, I'd rate it a 3.5 I probably will search for a thicker bundle before I'd purchase this one again.\n",
      "27276->Very easy to get started. | 4 | 0 | I created an s corp last year and was managing my accounts using spreadsheets- big mistake. I used TurboTax for business and realized later my experience with my first year's taxes would have been exponentially better if I had used Quickbooks to begin with. I had a problem with the install but a reboot of my PC straightened it out.<br /><br />Entering the data took a while but now that it's all set up, creating invoices and managing expenses is so much easier. My version has a module for payroll for one employee- perfect. It's just me. It works with my bank to manage and funds and make payments.<br /><br />I had a short relationship with Sage but this is so much easier and intuitive. I am very excited that my quarterly taxes will be so much easier to manage. Highly recommended.\n",
      "27277->So sad | 5 | 0 | This was the most perfect foundation I've ever used. I bet I used it for 12-15 years, and it never let me down. The formulation was consistent, light with medium coverage, no fragrance, slightly yellow enough to be the perfect color. It was worth every dime. My skin transitioned into middle age on this foundation, and I didn't realize what a rare thing that is. Most of the products on the market are made for younger skin, though they don't necessarily specify that. This one transcended a range of needs, including aging, blurring, SPF, tone...<br /><br />The new line that replaced this one is heavier coverage and not the same quality product. Now the line doesn't work well with older skin, and Benefit doesn't really have a line that is made for older skin. Also, their other lines don't have the warm/yellow undertone. They are more orangey. So thanks for being really clear about your ageism and market. That's too bad.\n",
      "27290->Hey! It Cuts hair! | 4 | 0 | This purchase was to replace a Wahl trimmer that died suddenly after a couple of years. It had done a good job but the feature I liked best about it was the built in vacuum. Stopped my wife from complaining about a trail of hair on the sink.<br /><br />After a quick look thru the internet I soon discovered this vacuum feature was a rarity. Then I found the NorelcoT980 Turbo here on Amazon. It has the vacuum and a extra Turbo function that your first time you'll think it's going to pull off all the hair. Well it doesn't but the motor does get louder in turbo and I'm sure it also eats up more battery power. It's a well made piece of machinery that feels good in your hand. The heigh adjustment click in nicely. The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you'll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in it's nicks and crannies.<br /><br />There is a second blade that is used for finer detailing like around your mouth. It works well and enables you to keep the hair out of your mouth. Funny thing about the attachments. The first few times you change them or remove the hair catcher they seem to be difficult to remove. But soon they pop off easily. Suppose it's just a matter of learning were to pull.<br /><br />I do wish it came with a stand for the razor. It comes with a pouch that you can store a everything including the charger, but somehow I get the feeling Norelco though us guys with beards travel a lot. I don't and would have like a place to sit the T980 where I can grab it for a quick trim.\n",
      "27294->Love Sun and Moon | 4 | 0 | I loved this design it looked really nice and was great for a sample idea of what I would want to get done for a real tattoo...<br />I did try one and was hoping it should stay well for my day at the lake but it like practically came off like an hour after getting wet. So for my next one I wore it instead for just everyday wear... Looked realistic, lasted a few days\n",
      "27303->Works best on normal nails not thick ones | 3 | 0 | This is a handy set of stainless podiatrist style nail trimmers and tools that come in a zippered storage case, making it convenient for travel or storage.<br /><br />The set includes one curved clipper, one angled one, a lifter for ingrown nails, a pusher for cuticle care, and two different files for smooth finishing.  The angled main clipper has a non-adjustable internal tension spring and a coated ergonomic shaped hand grip, while the other clipper has a coated non-ergonomic shaped grip.<br /><br />When trying to cut through tough thick nails you need a sure grip. Unfortunately, the grip coating material used on these clippers is hard and not padded, therefore failing to provide cushioning to users with arthritis or to provide a non-slip grip.<br /><br />I tried these clippers on my father's thick toenails, and they do cut, but not as sharply or precisely as the professional grade clippers I usually use on his nails.  Instead of one clean cut, it took several clips to get through his tough nails with these and because of that the finish was jagged and needed filing to smooth out.<br /><br />Though I wouldn't recommend this set for seniors, I do think the curved shape of the larger clipper is a nice touch though, so they're useful enough for regular nails and handy to pack if you're planning a trip.\n",
      "27317->Great for brushing hangboards and outdoors! | 5 | 0 | Pros: price, durability, function<br /><br />Cons: doesn’t fit in a typical climbing chalk bag elastic loop so I’ve lost one :(\n",
      "27324->Stinks mild results - not good for experienced tanners | 2 | 0 | Great for new tanners or someone who has not idea what quality really is.<br />I have been tanning for 10 plus years thought I would mix up my brand. That was a big mistake.<br />For the price I really thought it was going to be a well made well invested in product. Not like my others that leave me smelling wonderful HOURS later. .Not this.<br />It stinks, Maybe it's just me. Very light in color and consistency is nice enough. Wish the top didn't come completely off. Could be risk for losing it.<br />I will say tho, It does not stain the hands and when applied properly in a circular motion no streaks or patches. not the dark color I wanted.\n",

      "27339->I like it. . . with a couple of \"issues\" | 4 | 0 | First of all, there is a sticker over the charging lights, so you will want to remove that.<br /><br />My shaver came pre-charged, which was nice.<br /><br />Speaking of charging, one thing this shaver is missing is a cradle for charging.  You have to plug it in.  Not that big of a deal, but it would have been nice to have a cradle.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a very nice shaver.  It’s comfortable to hold, and smooth.  No “pulling” of hairs.  It has two shaver heads.  A lot of the less expensive models have only one.  I haven’t had any issues with “loose hairs” either – hairs that it doesn’t cut.<br /><br />I like that you can wash it with water.<br /><br />For the price, I don’t see that much difference between this one and a couple of the other Wahl models, which are lower in price.<br /><br />One thing that this one is missing. . . a way to “lock” it for travel, so that it will not accidently turn-on when something presses against it.  It really should have that at this price.\n",
      "27348->Nice body brushes with interesting design | 4 | 0 | There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath \"sponge\" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This \"brush\" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this \"brush\" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.\n",
      "27365->AN EYE OPENER | 5 | 0 | Easy to use and soothing to the under eyes.The gel nourishes the delicate and thin skin by tackling dark circles and puffiness giving my face a youthful glow. I Love this product!<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been a couple weeks since I have received this product and I must say it has enhance my features. I look less tired and more awake. LOVE!\n",
      "27392->Good quality, nice color options | 4 | 0 | Colors are pretty in person but slightly different than as pictured in the uploaded pic. The pink is a true baby light pink (photo looks a little peachy toned pink...)<br />purchased this to make party bag favors for my 6yr olds birthday slumber party.\n",
      "27424->Works BUT might be for kids or petite adults | 3 | 0 | Im a petite female and this training aid fits me perfectly. It slides right above my elbows, as it should. It’s getting my arm & body used to being aligned which creates a proper swing.<br /><br />PRO: noticeably keep my arms and body connected. Corrected my swing when I’m wearing it.<br />CON: I can’t imagine this fitting a normal or large size adult. The arm holes are really small and anyone with muscular arms would not be able to get it over their forearm. Does not stretch much and May not fit someone with broad shoulders.<br /><br />PRO: Material is a stiff elastic band which force you to stay aligned.<br />CON: I think there are similar products made with better material and can accommodate normal arm and shoulder widths.\n",
      "27425->Good bottle when not broken | 2 | 0 | This is actually a very nice bottle when it's not broken, there are 4 bottles in there, 3 of them works perfect, but one of them has a leak, the other smaller flat cream \"bottle\" had cracked edge.<br /><br />I would say work on quality control\n",
      "27428->Nice wrap up for hair when exiting shower. | 5 | 0 | Nothing to dislike<br />Liked that it was perfect size for wet hair rather than using a large bath towel as a wrap up that always seems to fall off.<br />Liked that once you twisted it around a few times there was a button and elastic hook on the back end to hold in it place until ready to blow dry hair.<br />Highly recommend and sure that it can accommodate long or short hair nicely.\n",
      "27432->Broke me out, which would been easier to accept ... | 1 | 0 | Broke me out, which would been easier to accept if it did not cost SO much.  I have a used once sparingly jar...the company has my money.<br />Seem normal in todays world.\n",
      "27438->They will do the job. | 4 | 0 | Was a little bit disappointed in the quality of these,  but they do what they’re meant to. Plastic so thin that if it gets bumped in a spot, it stays indented there. they’re functional, very thin plastic. Completely sheer, so that’s a plus, can see exactly what’s in them. Price is right.<br />Labels included are helpful, too.\n",
      "27454->Pretty shade | 5 | 0 | Beautiful shade and a little shiny nail polish. Perfect for summer manicures. Essie makes high quality nail polishes, they are very quick to dry and lasts longer. It's limited edition and bottle cap has beautiful design printed on it. A nice addition to my collection of nail polishes.<br />I'll definitely recommend this color and brand.\n",
      "27477->not as powerful | 3 | 0 | I had the older version of this from a couple of years back, and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband, and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one, and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.<br /><br />For the price I paid, though, it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions.\n",
      "27493->but it wasn't a flavor that I loved. Granted | 3 | 0 | I have a hard time swallowing pills and can't take them with water, so I always look for alternative ways to get nutrients where I can coat them in flavor.  Getting extra collagen is something I have focused on as there have been a lot of studies about the benefits.  Sometimes the powder is hard to stomach, so I wanted to try this orange drink.<br /><br />I didn't care for the flavor.  It was too - orange.  I realize we are trying to cover up the taste of the collagen, but it wasn't a flavor that I loved.  Granted, I could stomach it, but I'm not sure I would get it again.<br /><br />With the collagen, I feel like it takes several weeks to notice the benefits, and I didn't have a large enough supply (only one month) for those to start.  I feel like it was very similar to when I start drinking a ton of water - maybe there are some slight benefits, but they are too small to really notice.\n",
      "27536->Mixed review: Great eyeliner; terrible mascara | 3 | 0 | Really like the eyeliner. It’s dark and stays well, lasting for hours.<br />The mascara is black but doesn’t coat eyelashes so since they are sold together it’s a three star.<br />Alone, the eyeliner would get five stars and the mascara one .\n",
      "27539->Lovely first essence | 5 | 0 | This is kind of like a cross between a toner and a serum. I have been using it kind of like klairs moisturizing toner, even though it is a little thinner than that. It slaps on and seems to spread over my face nicely, sinks in very quickly, and provides a nice boost of moisture prior to putting on a thicker serum and then moisturizer.<br /><br />I had been reading about this product for really long time before trying it and it's kind of a cult favorite in the K beauty world. I can see why. It's not flashy, but as a first thing to splash on your face and hold in some of that moisture, it works well and doesn't clash with other products.\n",
      "27552->Not study enough for frequent travel | 3 | 0 | I purchased a set of two of these in January 2018, and just tossed them after a trip where both of them split at the seams. If you're not a frequent traveler, these are fine, but we use them at least 1x a month for anything from a weekend trip to a 3 week trip to Europe. They replaced a set of REI bags that had one too many liquid leaks that didn't get cleaned in time (oops), which lasted us 7 years. These made it just over a quarter of that time.<br /><br />Ours split next to the seams, usually because something \"sharp\" like a toothpaste tube, shifted in the bag and pushed up against the side.  I won't be buying them again, and I'm searching for something new. Again. TSA - please knock off the clear bags so I can use something more eco friendly like fabric!\n",

      "27575->Color not as shown/low durability | 2 | 0 | I bought temperature change shade 072. I was really looking forward to a green/grey polish, but disappointingly, this is just glitter white to pewter, not as shown. Also had to edit my review to reflect the quality of the polish; it peels much more easily than other gel brands I've tried and several nails lasted only a day or less. Originally bought this for a wedding, and good thing I'm planning ahead because I'll need to look for something else.<br />If you don't care about durability, this at least goes on well and temperature change is as expected (although not the same color at all as the product image).\n",
      "27577->honestly feels like I put glue around my nail | 2 | 0 | honestly feels like I put glue around my nail. was very thin and didn't peel off easily, I think I need to use more of the product to really have it work. I wish it came with instructions because its just the bottle, and since its in Chinese I have no idea what the bottle actually says to look up instructions....oh well. will continue trying this item and will update review<br /><br />UPDATE: so ive been using this product for a month or two and still feel the same as before....doesnt look anything like the photos, doesnt dry quickly...took more than 20 min to dry! and when it peeled off it didnt all come off so i was forced to use my tweezers and basically scratch at my skin until it somewhat came off :/ i would recommend buying a different brand...as for me i tossed this one in the trash!\n",

      "27596->Not too bad! | 4 | 0 | Not bad!! There are several reviews saying the tape did not last long in their hair however that was not an issue for me at all. I purchased the silver 18 inch set. My first hair extension application and it went well! Of course my husband had to help!<br />We watched a YouTube video and applied the tape by sandwiching a small section of hair between each. He also used the hair straightener (which I think was the trick for lasting adhesion) to squeeze the tape onto my hair for a few seconds. For the most part they did pretty well. I’ve had them in for about 2 months. They don’t handle washing very well so I tend to really condition the ends and need to trim them occasionally as they will fray a bit and break after a lot of styling. For an inexpensive set I’m not disappointed at all. I was able to curl them as needed as seen in the picture.  Will purchase a higher quality next time so I don’t have to apply so much oil and conditioner to keep them soft.\n",
      "27600->Meh, there’s better options | 2 | 0 | I am very unimpressed with this jade roller. Upon ordering I thought this would be a lovely addition to my skin care routines. I thought I could use it for depuffing, to help increase product absorption or simply to apply a little massage oil before using my myofascial tools. I’m not even entire sure I can utilize this..<br /><br />First the roller part detaches from the lid easily. On unboxing and just checking out the tool I placed the cap back on the tool and then when i went to remove it for first use the roller ball came right off the top. It took me about 15 minutes to be able to twist lock the rolled ball back to the lid. (First photo) Once I got the roller ball re attached and tried to place ice in the main compartment I found you cant get regular shaped ice in. Only broken ice will fit into the packaging. Secondly, the first time I place ice in it the roller was not cold at all what so ever. I actually had to place ice, let it melt and then place a second round of fresh ice in it for the roller ball to actually get cold. Thirdly, it has no fluid control at all what so ever. So when using this with ice or if the ice melts at all it will just profusely leak water all over where ever you’re applying it. So that rules out me being able to use this with massage oil.<br /><br />I do like the size of the jade roller and I feel like the concept is there it just needs better packaging. I can’t say I would recommend this because it feels cheap. There’s better jade roller options on the market that would provide better consistency with use, effectiveness and results.\n",
      "27602->Novel Shaver, but not very practical | 2 | 0 | If you are a road warrior you better keep your old razor.  Don't be fooled by the Aritec's sleek appearance, the hardshell travel case for the Arcitec is big.  You will not be able to throw this in a breifcase and go.  Even the countertop charging stand is big.<br /><br />And bring a scissors; the tube clipper is ineffective.  It is concealed behind the large rotary heads, even when it is extended it is nearly impossible to use.  It can only be used in odd angles in order to see what you are trimming.  For example, I sometimes trim hair growing over my ears - but not with the Arcitec - you can't trim in that direction.<br /><br />On the plus side - the shaving head is very good and offers a nice close shave.  It says in the manual that you have to use this razor for a while to get used to it.  I had no trouble adjusting to the shave, but the jury is out on the other aspects of what makes a good electric razor.  Recommendation - unless you just like the novelty and asthetics - look for a more practical razor.\n",
      "27631->Nice but... | 3 | 0 | These are nice but after you wash them or take them off your head, it's not as easy to find the knot again. You kind of have to play around with it to get it back and even then, it's not 100% back to it's original shape.<br /><br />Outside of this, it's very soft and it does stretch.\n",
      "27635->Easy to use, gentle, and effective | 4 | 0 | Beautiful bright color makes it easy to locate in the puppy’s storage bin. I also like that its simply designed, easy to use, works well, its gentle on their paws, and it comes with a super soft drying cloth.<br /><br />The silicon bristles are removable and it can be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned in minutes. We get a lot of use out of it and at first, our puppies found it to be a nuisance to pop each paw in the cup, now our pups have come to expect it.<br /><br />We have been able to keep our light tan carpet free of dirty paw prints and have peace of mind that there aren’t any harmful residual chemicals left on their paws from our walks. We are happy with this product and would recommend it to others.\n",

      "27648->NOT AT ALL PLEASED | 2 | 0 | To the point,<br /> The wigs color was more copper than what I thought. That could have just be because in the pictures it does seem to have dark undertones but there are none.  26 inches I beg to differ, I think this wig was about a 22 inches. It had no weight to it. It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored. I have never left a bad review but after spending almost 200 dollars I figured I'd at least give someone the heads up before they go in on this wig. Blonde colored wigs are more expensive, I understand because they have to dye them, but this one just lost the entire mark. and just FYI the wig cap is biigggggggg.....I will not be returning it. I'll cut my losses and stick to my normal brands.  I re-dyed it, re styled it and even cut it. I hate returning, so I will use it one of my, home wigs.  Very disappointed.\n",

I have a license and degree in Cosmetology but I don't practice professionally. Nail filing is a skill anyone with a file can master. I bought this because I saw it was recommended for use with jamberries. I have some but I was interested in using it with my super thin sensationail nail shields. It's a thin flimsy sticker you can put on before applying gel polish which makes the removal much easier. I'd compare it to a super thin jamberries.<br />Unfortunately it didn't help as expected. I am painting my nails right now and was using the stock mini disposable file that came with the shields.<br />I found this file feels a little dull. I can't see any difference in using this or any regular file.<br />The nail stickers still have a raggedy edge and it didn't feel any smoother than when I use other files.<br />I am not interested in trying another brand/style at this time due to the blah results. It's not a must have for the arsenal.<br />I'm giving it an extra star because it is constructed nicely and I haven't broke it, which says a lot about its durability.<br />I can't handle rough nail edges it makes me cringe. I'm using it while I write this review and it's just confirming I don't need this.\n",
      "27679->TOO SMALL period | 2 | 0 | No matter how i try to wear these, they are just too small. They hurt my nose. If I push it off my nose then the bottom is on the top of my bottom lip. Im not a big guy (weigh well under 200 pounds) and my head is an average size for a guy around 5 foot to 6 foot tall. Its like they're made for children.<br />The header picture is of a lady, but when you click on the listing there's pictures of a man wearing these in the listing, so its not a gender issue. They are sold as one size fits all. They're just too small. Make them larger and you will have a winning item.<br />ALSO one of the pictures states \"glasses fog up\" and it shows a guy with a standard face mask with fogged glasses. That picture is misleading. These do NOT fix this issue. I have others of these that are larger that I wear and they too still fog glasses (as these did as well) . Nothing i have found really fixes that issue aside from just not wearing a mask.\n",
      "27691->Deep Cleaning Face Mask | 5 | 0 | Are you looking for the ultimate in squeaky clean skin? This citrus-based mask cleanses pores like a dream, removing oil and dirt while softening skin too. You will need to moisturize after using this as your skin will feel a little tighter and drier. If you have oily problem skin, this will impress. Leave it on 8 minutes for the best effect. The texture of this mask is a little like firm whipping cream instead of clay. It is easy to apply and remove with a little extra care. You will immediately notice how absolutely purified your pores look. Impressive!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

Many years later and wifey is still using it.<br />Pros:<br />Ample space for many kinds of stuff<br /><br />Cons:<br />The plastic railing on the side comes off a couple of times, but I manage to put it back.<br />Check the size first because it might be too big for your vanity table\n",

I followed the directions; I left the mask on for an hour, and two days later I soaked my feet in hot water. I've used products like this before and seen dramatic peeling about 5 days later.

      "27736->These have a beautiful well crafted box that these come in and inside ... | 5 | 0 | First and foremost these are not your ordinary everyday bath bombs.  These are some fancy smancy ones.  I was quite shocked to see the packaging for these when they arrived I was not expecting this.<br />These have a beautiful well crafted box that these come in and inside of the box you ill find your 6 bath bombs wrapped individually and set in some small crinkle packaging.<br />When getting a packaged set of anything I usually always have one that I really do not prefer but this set of bombs they all smell heavenly.  Love the aroma these put out while in the tub and love how the aroma lingers in my bedroom for a while afterwards.<br />Love how these just relax you while sitting in the tub after a long hard day.<br />I am in love with this set and would purchase again.<br />I received these bath bombs for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to the conclusion by using these bath bombs myself.\n",
      "27739->NOT what I ordered | 1 | 0 | After 3 weeks I finally got my item...all the way from China (had I known I would have ordered elsewhere). The tool is sturdy, but not what I ordered so it's useless to me. I ordered the v shaped cuticle trimmer and have included a photo of what I received. It has a curved point at the end rather than a v.<br /><br />Never again.\n",
      "27742->Eyeliner burns do not buy this product see pics | 1 | 0 | First time trying these. I have purchased other similar products, and NEVER had a problem! My eyes after about 30 minutes started having a burning sensation. I took them off and woke up to my eye having a burned lid and swelling. I am not a person has allergies to anything! So this came as a shock. I took an allergy pill and a diuretic to see if I can get the sweeping to go down at least. My eye is very sensitive to the touch now.<br /><br />Update Day 3, picture 3, you can see I recieved 2nd degree burns from this product. Please do not purchase this product for you or your teenage daughter or friend. Remember the whole flip flop 2nd degree burn years ago? I am also curious if anyone has experienced this as well. The packaging is beautiful, but the product is dangerous.\n",

      "27769->Not Convenient to Use | 3 | 0 | The holder is larger than I expected. It’s also not easy to clean. I had to use so much water to clean one brush, so it’s not efficient at all. However, the quality is really good.<br />Also, it doesn’t hold all kinds of brushes. Some of my brushes were too small for it to hold.\n",
      "27785->Excellent in All Areas | 5 | 0 | This is a very unique and effective product.<br /><br />Used with a light pre-styler on medium-length hair:<br /><br />Scent: It's a light scent. Warm and slightly spiced. Very pleasant and masculine.<br />Consistency: Extremely creamy. Becomes slightly tacky when emulsifying.<br />Styling: Smooth through the hair at first, with increasing tug the more you style. This is not a problem for me and is part of getting great hold from a product.<br />Finish: Slightly shiny at first, but becomes much more matte as it dries in the hair.<br />Hold: Legitimate all-day hold without becoming too rigid to restyle.<br /><br />This is one of my new favorites. Seriously good in all areas, which is so rare. TheSalonGuy has a real winner with this one.\n",
      "27786->Don't purchase this brush. Very brittle. | 2 | 0 | This is not a quality brush. The bristles are very brittle. They fall out with each stroke. My daughter's hair was even silk pressed when she tried this brush and there were bristles all over the bathroom floor.<br /><br />We ended up tossing them and went to Ross for the ones we are used to.\n",
      "27801->One side works, but that's all I need | 4 | 0 | I like one side of this Silicone Back Scrubber from Lnlofen. The “soft brush” side, the one with the longer bristles, works great for scrubbing my back. I can actually feel the bristles move against my skin, and so I feel like I’m getting clean.<br /><br />The other side, the “stiff brush” side, just slid right over my skin. I didn’t feel the bumps at all.<br /><br />I’m 5’5” and slender, the back scrubber is long enough for me.<br /><br />The package includes a hook to hang the brush in the shower, but I just loop it over the shower rail and it dries quickly. The brush can roll up into a compact bundle for storage.\n",
      "27803->Smells amazing, gentle and doesn't dry out your skin | 5 | 0 | This is a fantastic cleanser by Higher Education. It comes in a very nice squeeze tube that is nice and simple but has a very clean design in line with this product line. The cleanser smells fantastic very refreshing and really amazing, one of my favorites that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser does not produce a heavy lather but I don't really need that. It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is a fantastic cleanser that feels great on the skin and smells amazing, everything I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture.\n",
      "27814->Works well and without pain, but protective ends come off after a while | 3 | 0 | I bought this brush at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I'd seen all the wet brushes being sold at our local salons, but I never bought one because it seemed a bit gimmick-y.  Having given this one a try, I'm kind of wishing I'd bought one sooner!  The bristles are soft and flexible, and it never hurts to pull it through my hair.  It detangles hair quickly and is easy to clean.  My 4-year-old complains occasionally that it pulls at her tangles, but it is relatively rare, and a HUGE improvement over her old brush.<br /><br />EDIT 2/12/18: Unfortunately, the little balls on the ends of the bristles started popping off late last year, and the bristles really hurt without them.  We're tossing this one and have bought actual brand-name wet brushes as replacements.  I think I like the brand-name brushes a bit more, though it's hard to compare when it's been over a year since this brush was new.  Hopefully the brand-name ones last a bit longer.\n",
      "27821->way too strong | 2 | 0 | I tried the Lavanda. It is way too strong. It's suggested to spray it on clothes, on the body and perhaps even in air.<br />The spray is ejected in a tiny amount. I thought to myself it was too tiny an amount until I smelt it. It has all the good labels, no cruelty to animals, gluten free (I did pan on eating it!),  etc etc. With just a small amount on my wrist, the smell was overpowering. I thought it might wear off but I ended up washing it off. It was just too strong. Smelled chemically to me--not a bit like flowers. Can't imagine putting this on a baby or baby clothing.\n",
      "27831->Read before you buy... | 1 | 0 | -I’ve used lots of their products…and I always got compliments, but the final straw was their deplorable customer service. I figure if this is how I’m treated, then they most-assuredly treat all the other paying customers in the same exact manner. They wanted my opinion (not kidding – they really asked) so not only did I respond honestly, but I asked a question. Asked repeatedly. Rather than professionally answer my question, effectively teaching one customer at a time - waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting, continuing to ask. Ha, they tried to give me free products, and I refused them. I Just. Wanted. An. Answer - and not to be ‘bought off’, thinking that they were hiding behind emails, with no individual names, but ‘Team’ this and Team that. This may be a plausible solution for some, but not me. What an unequivocally repulsive way to treat a faithful and paying customer.<br /><br />-I’m not sure what changed, but Lisa Crary (CEO and owner) used to care. Used to have great staff. Used to respond to questions. But certainly not now. The products are acceptable enough, but expensive, purchasing from retailers (I grew sick of the ridiculous price mark-up) as well as directly from Sanitas. Even directly from the manufacturer, still pricy, but shipping was too inconsistent.<br /><br />-I’ve used FIVE cleansers (Glycolic Citrus, Enzyme Foaming, Milk & Honey, Lemon Crème Scrub, Lemon Crème Cleanser) seven types of treatment products (Brightening Peel Pads, Glyco Solution, PeptiDerm Eye, Essential Eye Essence, Hyaluronic Concentrate and the Serum, AHA kit, Retinol Peeling Crème, RejuvenA) three moisturizers (Topical C, Antioxident moisturizer, Vitamin C moisturizer) and three types of masks (Cranberry Lactic, Papaya Pineapple, Pumpkin Enzyme). Also, a few of the body products (Redensifying Lip Complex, Hydrating Sugar scrub, Brightening Hand cream, Foot Repair) and serums (Vita Rich, Vita C) just to try. The body stuff I positively hated, but I tried them none-the-less, since I *was a loyal customer. That’s just from memory, and there’s likely more. Oh, and their sunscreen. No one could tell me when it would be available again. The Moisture Mist too.<br /><br />-Pppfffttt, the money I have spent with that line of skin care. The super weird expiration code nearly drove me nuts, but I finally deciphered it with lots of research and phone calls over time. Some of the numbers don’t mean anything, but the letters are the most crucial – indicating the year produced.<br />-To refrain from giving Sanitas any more of my money, I purchased online from that *huge retailer that starts with an a, that always ships so quickly – and got a few expired products. Good thing the return policy is incredibly stellar, however my time was still wasted. Well, I admit that’s on me.<br /><br />-The packaging is nothing short of a nightmare, trying to get all the product out of the container being impossible, equaling a waste of money. Some of these products are in a pump style, in which case not all of the pumps even function. Of course, I called… they just didn’t care. I wish I’d save pictures, but anger forced me to toss it.<br /><br />-Get this! Some of the spas, dermatologists, and estheticians that carry the Sanitas line will *sell to customers the free products given to them by the manufacturer to further promote their line. The audacity of such is so incredibly offensive, and Sanitas should have removed their products from those retailers – but they didn’t do anything of the kind, because they didn’t care. I can easily say I’m over them, and others should be very cautious.<br /><br />-*Maybe what I have read on ‘job sites’ (where employees give their personal opinions about their employers, working conditions, work to life balance, management, wages, etc.) is unquestionably true, but it definitely can’t be good for the quality of products. *Maybe that’s the reason for the change. Whatever is the reason, I’ll never *ever use that skincare line again…<br /><br />…and instead switched to a skin care line from the Far East. Don’t waste your time and money. Know this - there’s better products out there.\n",
      "27851->Takes some adjustment time but love it! | 4 | 0 | I teach at a dance and performing arts school.  These are great for class!  However, the first 30- 60 minutes of wearing these with my mask is an adjustment time.  It feels hotter and sweatier at first, but once you get past that point, they make wearing the mask while exercises and talking for multiple hours so much better!<br /><br />I feel like I can talk easier and breathe easier.  If anyone has talked Or exercises for any long period of time In a mask, you will find that the mask starts to get damp and begins to stick to your mouth and nose.  This eliminates that completely and feels cooler in the long run.<br /><br />I bought this brand and another brand that looks almost exact the same, but this brand states it is silicone.  This brand seems a hair thicker but also feels “softer” on my skin...this produce was only $2-$3 more.\n",
      "27856->Not happy With it and I ended up sending it back | 1 | 0 | I would give this no stars if I could. Not at all what it says it is.<br />Once you put it to your foot/heel it slows down and it would take all day to do one foot. Not happy With it and I ended up sending it back.\n",

We are African American, so it's full, natural hair.<br />Holding up. No loose seams after several months of use.

      "27901->Temporary fix, best for women that wear make-up | 3 | 0 | Listen up, especially my fellow dudes that want to roll back the clock a bit. This is an expensive parlor trick to hide wrinkles as well as bags under your eyes. The substance temporarily tightens your skin with a film that is lightly colored with a Caucasian base make up (at least mine is; maybe they have other shades -- I am in fact a Caucasian male). If you touch it after it dries it will break the seal and you will lose the effect. It only lasts until you wash again or rub the area. I doubt you'd get a full day out of an application.<br /><br />I feel foolish for getting suckered into this expensive product as I was told it would be possible to drop back to weekly for 4 months then put the rest in a freezer for a few years - LOL!<br /><br />If I were a woman that wore a good *spray-based* makeup product over top of it I might think it is worth the money. As a man that doesn't wear make-up, even though the skin tone is close to my own, I think you can easily see I am wearing some sort of cosmetic product.<br /><br />I will probably only use this for web meetings and special occasions and then not buy again.\n",
      "27903->Not good at all | 1 | 0 | This is just talcum powder. I was looking for powered red sandalwood. When I wrote to them they were not ready to help.<br />As talcum powder it is too strong a smell\n",

      "27946->Bright red. Chapped my lips. | 1 | 0 | This HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss is bright red. I have fair skin so this \"gloss\" made me look like a corpse. It is also supposed to be a moisturizer but it made my lips crack and peel. Not happy with this at all.<br /><br />The lip \"gloss\" comes in a little tube and you brush on the color. If you have a different skin type than mine you might like it but it did chap my lips. I would think twice before getting this product.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss to family and friends.\n",
      "27959->Not to greasy and not an overpowering scent. | 5 | 0 | This WALRUS OIL seems to work pretty well. I have two tattoos that were looking a little dry. I put some oil on them and they did brighten up some. I will continue to use this to see if it improves more over time.<br /><br />The pack comes with one 2 ounce tin of vegan oil. It does have a slight scent but it is not overpowering at all. This product is for new and old ink.<br /><br />I will be recommending this WALRUS OIL to family and friends.\n",

      "28028->Helps a bit | 3 | 0 | I wear a lot of makeup when I have to perform for movie parties, and my costumes are usually extremely hot, so I can use all the help I can get when it comes to keeping my makeup in place! This does seem to help a bit, I notice in particular that my cheek color stays on much better. When I don't use a primer, it's like my skin drinks it up within just a few hours. So it definitely helps with that.<br /><br />I really don't see any change in the texture of my skin when I use it, no minimizing of lines or pores or anything like that. I was kind of hoping a nice little mist of vitamins might help (& feel good) even when I'm not wearing makeup, but to be honest it doesn't really feel much different. I tried for a few days & then I kept forgetting all about it - that's how dramatic the difference...wasn't. I'll still keep using it under makeup for performances, when I really need that stuff to stay put, but I probably won't rush to buy it again after I run out.\n",
      "28041->Good for the price, easy to customize | 4 | 0 | Right out of the box, the wig is quite shiny. Easy to brush though. There are combs in the cap so that was a nice surprise. The length that you see in my photo is the basic length then in the back, it's longer, like extensions. It's nice but it was too heavy and too long for me. I cut that length off and it was much better (for me. YMMV).<br /><br />The curl at the bottom is, I don't know how to put this, like all the curl is at the bottom. I'll be adding some strand definition in and then I think it will be good.<br /><br />For the price, I am fairly pleased with this!\n",
      "28082->Just what I was looking for! | 5 | 0 | Arrived on time and as pictured.<br />I needed something to make my own lash booster and apply cleanly.<br />Decided on these and glad I did, they were exactly what I needed.\n",
      "28092->Ok but I got defective one | 2 | 0 | Just ok quality, I liked that they sell blank head so I can do makeup and also it’s made with soft material, however mine came with one side of the face squashed. Had to return.<br /><br />Also note that this head is quite small like 10-12yr old girl size. Not realistic/ideal for displaying adult size products. I was going to display earrings but its ears are way too small...it would certainly give wrong ideas to customers about the product size.<br /><br />If you’re thinking about getting this just to fix wigs on for wig making, I’d suggest fabric canvas head instead of this. They have the option for more realistic/larger head size.\n",
      "28102->Terrible product | 1 | 0 | These are awful , there are no instructions. When I tried to take them off, they wouldn’t budge . Hurt too ! I had to soak eye pads in water and put over eyes and soak them off<br />Would not recommend not buy again\n",
      "28103->Don't base this color off photos | 4 | 0 | I was worried the bottle would break or leak during shipping. I think I could have bounced the package off a three story building and the bottle wouldn't have broken.<br /><br />I'm pretty disappointed with the color (not the sellers fault) in photos I'd seen the color looks more like a frosted, brick orange, and the real color is more like a pumpkin color.\n",

The price is worth a few dropped stones.<br />THE PRICE\n",
      "28202->Fun flavors! | 4 | 0 | First, I did find these to be thinner than my original coconut glossy. They still add shine and a ton of sweet flavor, but go on a little heavy out of the tube.<br />The texture after it settles is nice, shiny and not drying. The scents are fantastic, true to the super sweet scents of my much younger years.<br />It's a fun way to mix up my lip balms!\n",
      "28210->Durable, easy to use | 5 | 0 | These are great even if you have long  thick hair. I can easily clip portions of hair out of the way while  blow drying one section at a time.  These have really made blow drying a lot easier.<br /><br />Even if you have difficulty with your hands, you may find these easy to work with.  I do.<br /><br />If I were putting together a gift bag, these would be in it.\n",

      "28251->Best Electric Razor I've Ever Used | 4 | 0 | [[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men's Shaver]]<br />I made the mistake last year of buying my first foil type razor from Amazon(Braun 360 Complete)after using a Norelco rotary for years. I only wish I could return it since it was much more expensive than the Norelco. After using for almost a year I gave up on it and recently purchased the 8140XL. This is without a doubt the best electric razor I've ever used. It is unbelievably quiet and shaves very close without irritation even on the neck hairs. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have an indicator that shows how much charge is remaining and  it doesn't charge without a charging stand. Other than that so far I'm very pleased and would highly recommend it.\n",
      "28253->Very nice moisturizine cream | 5 | 0 | This hydrating cream by Sustainable Youth is one of their better products in my eyes. It is a pretty heavy cream but it does absorb fairly quickly and fully into your skin. It smells heavily of citrus, so finally one of their products actually smells good. Most of their products I have tried to date either don't have a scent or smell kind of bad. Considering how expensive they are in general that is just not acceptable in my eyes. Thankfully this one actually smells pretty good since it is also pretty expensive.<br /><br />This heavier cream actually leaves behind very soft skin that looks good. I liked how my skin felt. The scent of it does dissipate fairly quickly though but that is ok. All in all this is probably my favorite product in their line. Would I repurchase, probably not because their are products out there as good and better for a similar price or cheaper. But from this line this is their best product in my opinion.\n",
      "28272->Finally, a color that matches! | 4 | 0 | After trying various high-end and drugstore brands, I was beginning to feel like I'd never find the right shade to fill in my thinning brows. Some eyebrow pens were a much lighter shade of brown and looked artificial. Others looked good when first applied but would fade to an unappealing shade of green through the course of a day.<br /><br />I came across this product as one of Amazon's suggestions. It was listed at a reasonable price and was highly recommended by reviewers so I figured I'd give it a try. Although the color is labelled as gray, its more of a cool dark brow with a slight gray tint to it. Application was easy and the color didn't fade much by the end of the day. It is easily removed with make-up remover prior to doing my nightly skincare routine. I haven't had it long enough to determine how long each pen lasts before drying out, but so far so good!\n",
      "28275->Irritated eyes and no added effect. Not one iota of difference on my lashes. | 1 | 0 | I've used fiber lash mascaras before- they usually have a pronounced effect, and is why I wanted to try this Kissio Derol mascara. The thing is, it doesn't do anything for me. I am perplexed. I applied the primer (comb brush with hairs/fibers), then followed up with the bushy brush mascara. And.. nothing. I can not see even a miniscule amount of added volume or length. Not even more than a basic mascara. Initially it had not bothered my sensitive eyes for the first few hours but then my eyes started getting itchy and irritated like they had something in them-- the fibers were falling off into my eyes! My eye where it was most bothered was red. I'm done with trying mascara unless it is a known brand.<br />Sad :(\n",
      "28295->Excellent empty glass bottle set perfect for hair coloring, essential oil sprays, etc. | 5 | 0 | There are two amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, four black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and two standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $18.98 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $9.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals.  Their [[ASIN:B08HGZXLP6 four-pack of bottles]] is about $1 cheaper per bottle.\n",
      "28303->Does not work. They are on the dry side ... | 1 | 0 | Does not work. They are on the dry side and does not remove make up. It has a heavy synthetic perfum smell.<br />After using it I thought my makeup was off as nothing much came off on the sheet but when I checked it just did not take anything off.\n",
      "28306->Great shaving - worth the funky scent | 4 | 0 | Would be 5 stars but it smells like a urinal cake.  It's not unpleasant, it's just a strong industrial cleaner type smell and it fills up the whole bathroom.<br /><br />Compares favorably to my current favorite, the Palmolive shave stick.  Lathers even easier.  Not quite as slick, but very effective.  Hardly takes any water or effort to build a good lather.  I don't know how you could possibly not get a satisfactory shave with this stuff.  And for the cost of this stuff, it's a steal.  I plan to always have some on hand from now on.  If you can deal with the smell, this is your product if you're shaving on a budget.\n",
      "28313->An expensive mixed bag | 3 | 0 | There are only a few reviews on Castle Forbes' Special Reserve Neroli. A couple are on here, a few randomly online. You have to dig for them. So if you're reading this, you're more of a fragrance lover than the average Tommy Bahama fan. Put simply, CF Neroli is not a popular EDP, nor is the brand. You have to know some things about fragrance and have a specific knowledge about neroli itself, to have come searching for Castle Forbes version. This is how I came to know this brand and EDP myself.<br />My view is that it's not worth the cost of 160USD. That's a lot of money for a 3.4oz. bottle. CF has a nice brand image, the EDP presentation is great, and the quality of the materials used are outstanding. However, the scent alone falls short.<br />Neroli Reserve starts out wonderfully: crisp orange and neroli, combined with greens like pine, grass and hedges. You feel like you're at the beach, sitting just where the sand dunes meet a lush forest. This lasts for about 20 minutes. Then the \"woody/musky\" basenotes kick in, and this is where CF got it wrong. It deteriorates into a powdery, barbershop, very British scent. It's something your grandmother (not grandfather) would have worn if she lived in London in 1865. Designer houses today try and replicate this a bit, usually just producing a floraly, loud, baby powder vibe (see MDCI Invasion Barbare). This basenote scent is what then dominates for the next 10 hours, more if you've sprayed any arm/chest hair. The woods aren't masculine woods, just faint tree bark really.<br />The EDP strength is phenomenal; this stuff lasts. The only problem is whether or not you like to smell like a woman, particularly a powderpuff with flowers. I do get some faint whiffs of neroli, but it's overpowered by the floral powder. I would not recommend this for a man, and unfortunately, would recommend Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino over this. A different vibe for sure (more aquatic), but TF's neroli sustains.<br />Overall, 3 of 5 stars just because the ingredients are so good, but the scent isn't as much neroli as it is the musky amber that CF used. Bummer.\n",

      "28331->Just ok in my book | 3 | 0 | This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. It almost felt like a lotion when I used it. So the description that it does NOT lather is 100% accurate. I was a bit confused by that to be honest so yes read the description. It works very well that is true. It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else. So this only gets an ok since it wasn't outstanding in any category really. I had no negative reactions to it and it is super gentle but that is about it.\n",
      "28348->I had to try it for myself. | 2 | 0 | After reading all of the bad reviews on this new Norelco shaver, I swore I was not going to buy this unit.<br /><br />Well, a few months ago I realized my local stores didn't stock my HQ5 Norelco replacement blades anymore and I about had a heart attack. Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.<br /><br />I have had a Norelco 5885XL for the past 13 years. I love this unit and it suits me well. This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.<br /><br />Here is my 1050x review.. it was painful to write, but here goes..<br /><br />--This is a noisy shaver folks.. I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH? This is not good. I simply cannot accept a noisy shaver. This thing is inches away from my ears at 5am and that is very annoying. I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.<br /><br />--What a bad shave. Starting with a 2-day shadow growth, I shaved half of my face with my trusty 5885XL [using 1.5 year old blades] and the other half with my shiny new 1050x unit. I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn't being overly critical of my new toy.<br /><br />As I suspected, she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.<br /><br />As I shaved with the 1050x, I realized that I was going over the same growth areas without making things smoother, especially around the neck.  I was getting tired, frustrated, and irritated. The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.<br /><br />--Here come the skin irritations: Ahhh!!!<br />Just a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was]. Having used Norelcos all of my shaving life, about 25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn't. no thanks..<br /><br />--Bad charging system!  What the heck is it with this terrible charging system. I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel. The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?! I can see this cable being the 1st thing I lose on a business trip because it does not have a place to be stored.<br /><br />Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver. I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong. Sadly, they are correct in every way.<br /><br />My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco's older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide. Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90's IMHO.<br /><br />Norelco, come'on buddy.. Your losing me big time here.<br /><br />It's back to my 5885xl, and I have found my HQ5's here on Amazon, clicking buy; and it's byebye to my 1050x.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />F.\n",

When applying the gel, it at first feels a bit sticky. That stickiness soon disappears and then my face just feels like it has come type of facial cream on it. Using it as a night cream, I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling nice and hydrated vs dried out. This is a nice cream to use after being outside in the elements all day. The wind or sun can really dry out my skin.<br /><br />I have had no skin irritations since I began using this product.\n",

The massager charges very quickly for immediate use.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I feel that the massager is a little weak to actually work.  I feel most of the vibration at the base of the product, and not much at the tip.  Also, the heating element of this product is very weak.  It barely gets warm.\n",

      "28573->Doesn't lather, smells bad and doesn't clean | 2 | 0 | I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.\n",

This hair dryer has reduced my getting ready time incredibly. I’m so happy with it!!!<br /><br />Love - love - love this dryer.<br />I prefer stick straight hair & typically use a hair straightener after every wash...with using this dryer, I might use the straightener 4 out of 5 washes.<br />The dryer does not get hot ..which, I think heat makes the drying process feel great for me..but it dries with blow out results..can’t beat it..small sacrifice for healthier hair\n",

The consistency of it was a little more coarse them I was expecting, was expecting something more fine from the product pictures. I would say consistency is similar to salt vs something like flour.  I ended up using a food processor to grind it up more into a finer powder.  Other than that happy with it.<br /><br />The packaging does say for external use only as well.\n",

I wore L@$h!fy for two years and am so pleased there are finally more affordable options!<br /><br />I ordered all 3 packs of lashes to test them. My absolute favorite are the tapered 10-20s!!! The taper makes the corners VERY realistic and finishes off the set beautifully. I’ve always had a hard time making my outer corners flick up in a cat eye shape, I usually do them all in a fan across my lashes. This is the first I’ve seen this taper in cluster lashes and I wish they all came like this!!!! I’m about to stock up on these.<br /><br />I still use the L brand glue and the lashes are holding on great.\n",
      "28590->Gives a QUICK and CLOSE Shave. | 5 | 0 | I ordered this for my partner, who has been using a 3-head rotary shaver to shave his head. This one does a far better job!  It has many great features, including:<br /><br />1) It arrives fully charged, ready to use.<br /><br />2) Along with the 6-head shaving attachment, It has just about every shaving accessory you could want; a facial cleansing brush, sideburn trimmer, nose/ear trimmer, face cleaning sponge.<br /><br />3) It is washable.<br /><br />4) It comes with the USB cord for charging, and you get approximately 90 minutes of shave time after 1.5 hours of charging.<br /><br />HERE'S THE BEST PART: It gives a QUICK and CLOSE shave to my partner's head, with no tugging or pulling.<br />He said \"This is like having a riding mower for my head, versus a push-mower\". LOL! I think that's a pretty good testimonial.<br /><br />As a final note, the price is reasonable, especially considering all the good features of this unit.<br /><br />P.S. to the ladies: I think the 6-head attachment could make a great shaver for your legs, so you might want one of your own. :>)\n",
      "28591->... this Facial Mask for quite some time now and like other products that I have tried from OZ Naturals | 5 | 0 | I have been using this Facial Mask for quite some time now and like other products that I have tried from OZ Naturals, I love it! When I hit my early thirties, I started having issues with extreme dryness and skin sensitivity. I struggled trying to find products that will work with my perpetually problematic skin so I get extremely excited and happy when I do find products that work for my skin issues. I use this mask and leave it on my face for 30 minutes before washing it off. I never had any bad skin reactions to it and when I finally washed it off, my skin looks hydrated! Fall and Winter is just around the corner....so needless to say, this product will be my new best friends in the upcoming colder months!<br /><br />As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.

      "28655->Wow!  I was skeptical, -but it WORKS! | 5 | 0 | Takes the tangles out -F-A-S-T-.<br />Took less than 3 minutes with this brush.<br />It used to take at least 15 minutes and I'd have to rip and tear my hair out.<br />Get this!  You won't regret it.\n",
      "28656->Painful, needs eye protection, hard to read and unclear manual | 1 | 0 | I am interested in red light therapy. We all want to look younger, right? But, I feel like this was a bad idea.<br /><br />It comes in a box labeled \"Colorful LED Beauty Mask\" rather than the one pictured in the main listing photo. There doesn't seem to be a company name on anything. The product looks the same and the box I received is shown in other photos, so I believe I got the right thing.<br /><br />As the manual says, \"Normal people use or stop using, ask the doctor after doctor.\" Yes, the manual is that poorly translated. I'm O.K. with a little grammar error here and there, but this was hard to understand. It doesn't make one feel confident in the quality. I don't even think it mentioned the microcurrent pegs. Do you need to use them or are they optional? What do they do? I really don't know after reading the manual.<br /><br />I can tell you that without the pegs in, the eye part dug in and felt horrible. I adjusted the mask strap to very loose, so it wasn't that. With the pegs in, the pegs in my forehead dug in and left marks that lasted over 30 minutes later, and one spot was still sore the next day. The microcurrent on just the lowest setting was a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it would be better when wearing a face mask, which is encouraged and which I had wanted to try.<br /><br />The eye holes do not block all the light from my eyes. The manual says to close eyes or use pads or eye shades. Dermatologists actually say to use blackout or opaque goggles.<br /><br />I didn't find it that heavy. Just awkward and painful. As others have mentioned, this is better lying down, since you can't open your eyes anyways. But, it's still not comfortable. It's also strange that the cord is only 3 1/2 feet, or maybe almost 4 feet stretched out. If I was to use it in bed, I'd need an extension cord.<br /><br />I can suffer a little for beauty, but I'm worried about the safety of this given the poor instructions, poor design and unknown origins. I can't recommend this for anyone, but in particular it is prohibited for pregnant women, children, thyroid disease, light allergic, drug users, and those with skin trauma (see photo). I recommend looking for an FDA-cleared device, preferably with built-in eye protection.\n",
      "28669->Good Soap But Doesn't Last Long | 3 | 0 | This is a good soap that lathers well and helped keep my skin RELATIVELY moist. It wasn't as good as others to that effect, but it did do a nice job of cleaning my skin from head to toe.<br /><br />The ingredients are really solid in this soap. From the charcoal to the dead sea salt, you get quite a bit of quality packed in. The problem is that this bar of soap quickly becomes soft and starts to break apart after about 2/3 use. This makes it difficult to use and therefore it starts to fall down into the drain, along with the value of this specific soap.<br /><br />If this soap lasted another week I would give it 4-5 stars. However, it lasted less than a week for two of us sharing it. At $14-16 a week in soap, there is not enough of a value proposition there for us to continue using it. There are better options on the market for both value and effectiveness in the areas we would like to have seen better with this soap.\n",
      "28673->Only Got Half | 3 | 0 | Unfortunately, I only got half of them, so I wasn't able to accurately review these. I got the lemon, tea tree, peach, and jasmine ones. Since I got the set mainly for the rose and coconut ones, I was definitely disappointed.<br /><br />The four that I did receive do smell decent. The scent is pretty mild. In my opinion, of the ones that I got, the jasmine and the peach smell the best. They do provide some suds, but they definitely don't suds up as well as I had hoped. They are a good size for putting in your purse, backpack, or another bag, and they will work in a clean-up emergency. Even if I'd gotten all eight packages, I probably wouldn't get these again.\n",
      "28686->I love these. Very handy. | 5 | 0 | I love these. I keep them in my car and in my purse. They are very handy.<br /><br />Make sure to get the wet-nap brand. I have bought other brands of towelettes and I have found them to be smaller in size and a bit flimsy.\n",
      "28687->Nice shaver! | 4 | 0 | I received this razor for Christmas from my wife.  I had requested it because shaving with a regular razor (Mach 3) had become too painful.  I have a very sensitive neck and the Mach 3 would leave me with razor burn and other facial bumps.  So, I just finished my 21-day trial and here are the results:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)  Much easier on my face.  My bumps/razor burn are healing nicely.<br />2)  Very easy to clean.  Just run it under water for a few seconds after each use.<br />3)  Holds charge well.  I have used the razor everyday for the past 21 days, about 10 minutes a day.  I have charged the razor 3 times, including the initial charge.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)  Shave is not as close as the Mach 3.  I'm sure this is to be expected, but this razor also misses several hairs on my neck not matter how many times I go over them.  However, the razor does perform much better on the flatter portions of my face.<br />2)  No battery indicator.  It ran out on me the other morning halfway through my shave.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this razor.  Don't expect it to cut as close as a Mach 3 though.\n",

      "28740->Doesn't Live Up To Reviews, Flat | 2 | 0 | Was very excited to treat myself to a nice foam that helped avoid razor bumps.<br />Well haflway through, I switched back to a Barbasol can that literally cost 1/10 the price. This thing was barely soapy water, not luxurious or thick at all. It was soft and felt okay, so Ill give it 2 stars, but ill probably never use it again.\n",
      "28789->Excellent empty glass bottle set perfect for hair coloring, essential oil sprays, etc. | 5 | 0 | There are four amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, six black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and four standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $33.99 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $8.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals. \n",
      "28800->A good deal. | 5 | 0 | ABOUT ME: Stylish male, early 30's. Since there's different sides to my personality, I like styling my hair in different ways to reflect that. This results in me blow drying my hair at least 5 times a week while applying multiple products everyday.<br />HOW I USED THE PRODUCT: I use twice a week. I wet & apply product to my hair about 5-10 minutes before taking a shower.<br />Afterwards, my hair is soft, shiny, healthy looking.\n",
      "28801->Note that slices are not full masks | 3 | 0 | Each pouch has 12 pineapple ring shaped slices you can stick on your face. It is not enough to cover my face and I can wear the average sheet mask.<br /><br />If you have used circular cucumber eye masks that various brands make, you will find these masks to be similar. You are receiving small rounds in a packet rather than a full sheet mask.<br /><br />However what is awkward is that unlike cucumber eye sheet masks, you get 12 slices rather than just 2. While this seems like it would be better, in reality is that means you need to commit to using all 12 slices of fruit in one go because there isn’t an easy way to reseal the mask package. It doesn’t come in a resealable pouch.<br /><br />Because you end up with 12 slices of mask to use you end up covering maybe half your face with slices and you’re basically doing more for less mask. The instructions do say this mask can be used anywhere on the body but I don’t know how that would work in practice. What areas need sheet masking and where will the rounds stick?<br /><br />I think if Kocostar had made the slice line of masks into a fruit salad deal with multiple slices of fruit per pouch that would’ve made more sense. If they had sold these masks as 12-120 rounds in a container like many eye masks are sold, that also would’ve made sense.<br /><br />I think if you intend on sharing these masks with others (Eg six friends each taking a pair of slices) or want to store the opened packages or want to use masks to target specific areas of your face or body this could be a good purchase.<br /><br />These mini masks were moisturizing but dried out faster than a full size sheet mask. I don’t know if that’s due to size or formula.\n",
      "28812->Great deodorant | 4 | 0 | First off, why the one star off? Of the 6 bottles, only two of them do not leak when spraying. The 4 that leak, do it from the cap and drip on my hand, floor, or counter.<br />The smell is awesome, it's light and airy. This deodorant works well for me, last all day.

      "28833->If you're looking for a starter kit... | 3 | 0 | This is probably a great starter kit for someone new to dry brushing. It's a really beautiful set and I especially like the back brush, but I have to admit that I'm happier with the little oil sample that came with it than I am with the brush.<br />The main dissatisfaction I have is that the bristles are very soft. Very. One has to work a very long time to get that pink tint that lets you know that it's working. And it sheds. For someone who likes a gentle brush, this may be perfect. Or for a beginner. Just not for me.<br />Shipment was prompt and fast.<br /><br />  **Update: I misstated the shedding of this brush the first time around. I ordered two at the same time. This one shed a lot the first couple of times I used it. It shed when I opened the bag right up until I realised that it just wasn't for me. I'm sure it's a temporary problem since so many people like it. Just be prepared in case it happens to you.\n",
      "28835->To hard for toddler's gums | 3 | 0 | Expected soft bristles since this is geared for toddlers. The bristles are hard. Plus image is small,  so my son didn't care for the brushes.  Had to get a new tooth brush from the store.<br />Will have to use these in a few years when my son can apply less pressure.\n",
      "28844->On the fence… | 3 | 0 | I’m still on the fence about this product. It doesn’t come with any directions but, because I’m basically an expert user in red light therapy devices I know how to use this. Someone who is not though, may not be sure…?<br />The component itself just feels kind of cheap. It’s not a ‘real’ stone. It doesn’t heat up very well. And although it charges super quickly, I just don’t think this device is strong enough to be helpful to the under eyes. I don’t think it’s hurting anything. But, I don’t think it’s helping in any way either, unfortunately.<br />It is very cute though.\n",
      "28849->Works good | 5 | 0 | I tested this out on my pugs the day it arrived.  I first tested to make sure they didn't fight me too much when I stuck their feet inside of the cup.  They didn't.  So, I filled with warm water, stuck their foot inside, turned the cup, then pulled their feet out to dry.<br />Seemed to work good.  I just want to be able to rinse their feet of any dirt, sand, pebbles, or anything else that gets stuck in their pads.<br />I like that it has a small handle so I can hook it up near the back door.\n",

      "28866->Hmmmmm. | 4 | 0 | I think these take more patience to use than I have.<br /><br />They're not HARD to use. I don't know why the other reviewers are having so much trouble figuring out how to use them! It's just hard to get them to look exactly right. But I'm nearly 50 with extremely long thick curly hair and I don't have a lot of time or patience for things like this. A teenager would probably put the time in to master this product just to get the cool look. And the look is really cool--I'm sure there are all kinds of interesting things a young person could figure out with these.<br /><br />Here's how you use them: You use a rat-tailed comb (or something like it) to section off the front-most piece of hair and then clip it out of the way. Then you put this in your hair like a regular barrette. THEN you take the section of hair out of its clip and divide it into equal sections (the number of sections in the barrette) and place each one of them inside the clips on top of the barrette. It's actually remarkably simple.<br /><br />I give this four stars because I was easily able to make it work and it seems to be fairly durable (I took off a star because it wasn't extremely robust). Any problems with figuring out how to use this product say more about the user than the product itself.<br /><br />Recommended for patient and cool young people.\n",
      "28874->Poor quality | 2 | 0 | Value for money is not good.<br />Cheap plastic with minor basic functions.\n",
      "28875->They Work, But Don't All Fit The Handle Well | 3 | 0 | These brushes look and brush the teeth just like the original ones. However, they vary considerably in the way they fit the handle. Some fit pretty well, others are quite loose or quite tight. Those that are too loose result in a annoying buzz while cleaning the teeth. The ones that are too tight are difficult to install and remove. This may be the reason the price is so reasonable, quality control was not what it should have been.<br /><br />In spite of this, they all will install on the handle and they do clean the teeth. I will put up with the frustration of an incorrect fit for the low price!\n",
      "28878->Like it! | 5 | 0 | I have enjoyed  this argan oil shampoo. It smells nice and lathers good. It make my hair feel very soft! I have been using it for about a week and it does seem to weigh down my hair I really like it!<br />*received this discounted for review\n",
      "28879->Make it bigger | 4 | 0 | It's not big enough for a razor & brush sadly.<br /><br />The brush is decently soft though.<br />Bowl could be bigger but works.\n",
      "28888->Unusual soap, but works well | 5 | 0 | I've not come across a face soap in this format -- it's a stick format, much like an antiperspirant. You rub the stick on your dry face, then use water. It's different but very easy to get used to quickly.<br /><br />The soap doesn't lather all that much but it does do a good job of cleaning without drying out my face. The scent is quite nice, with the eucalyptus coming through the most. It's a medium/mild level of scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. The scent does not linger after rinsing. The soap itself is black due to the inclusion of charcoal.<br /><br />The dispensing tube is well done, with a screw base that pushes up the soap easily and evenly. It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap. A bit pricey for the amount you get, but it's sufficiently unique to justify the cost, in my opinion. Five stars.\n",

      "28924->Another great product by Huxley | 5 | 0 | I really like products by Huxley. They tend to be not overpriced and the quality that I found to date is always very good. They always come in packaging that is stylish and looks good.<br />this clay mask is just along the lines and I for one even though clay masks tend to dry out my skin, really like this one.<br /><br />It looks great and this one smells fantastic, one of the things I really like about Huxley products. This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. I let it get pretty dry before I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My skin felt great and was nice and soft after I used this mask. I for one can only recommend this one.\n",
      "28938->Only for toddlers and a lot of flaws | 1 | 0 | This little brush is the perfect size for a purse.  I love to use boar bristle brushes in my hair because of the shine it gives me.  I tried to run this brush through my hair and the bristles are not dense enough to go through any hair except that of a toddler.  I wish that I could actually pull this brush completely through my hair but it just isn't happening.  I was also disappointed that the item had a sticker on the back and when I pulled it off it was sticky so my hair got caught in it.  Lastly, this brush just came as it was with a sticker.  There was no packaging around it and I'm a little grossed out that plenty of hands have touched my new hairbrush.  I am so disappointed.<br /><br />I purchased this travel size boar bristle hair brush at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them. I am not a paid reviewer and I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. I gain nothing by giving this item a positive, negative or neutral review. If at any time in the future with prolonged use of any product my opinion changes, I will leave an update to my review of the product (as you can see by past reviews, that happens).\n",
      "28940->Perfect for removal | 5 | 0 | This kit comes with everything you need to take off nail polish.<br />This particular set was for my mother in law who is just getting into gel polishes and she didn't understand what the clips were for at first 🤣<br />After I showed her how it took off the polish with scrubbing she was SOOOOO glad I got her this set!\n",
      "28943->Worth a try--it's good for you! | 4 | 0 | Who knows how old I'd look if I didn't use all my products, but this is great smelling and Vit C is so good for your skin.<br />Luxurious feeling product makes  you want to use it every evening!\n",
      "28951->Won't stay on. | 3 | 0 | Euphoria craze caught up to me.<br />I have medium length hair, layered. This probably works best for longer hair. I couldn't get it to stay tightly, tried different methods and they all got loose pretty quickly.<br /><br />Personally, I would only wear this during the day while I get ready. I did not find it comfortable enough to sleep with.\n",
      "28954->It's okay | 3 | 0 | I haven't seen any real results. There is some ingredient in there and I think it is retinol or something that is causing the area around my eye to heat up.

      "28966->Updated to two stars. Didn't last. | 2 | 0 | Works like a charm so far. He really enjoys the cut, no fuss at all, which probably has to do with the very low noise level.<br /><br />Update 1/8/2018. Had for two years; used half a dozen times. Then the head broke into three parts and couldn't be put back together. Contacted the seller and was told to buy a new one. It was cheap indeed but that's no excuse for a non-durable product.\n",
      "28974->Thinner than pictured, requires a hair dryer | 2 | 0 | I’ve got the KXAMELIE mountain green short nail set. It’s a lovely hunter green, as pictured, but that’s about it. They’re not nearly as nice or thick as advertised. I don’t think they’re UV gel, just plastic.<br /><br />The instructions are vague and unhelpful for beginners and you have to carefully peel off a sticker just to read them. I really wanted to like these nails, yet the glue tab system is a real pain in the neck! You have to get it on your nail, wrestle off the plastic cover, hold under a hair dryer until it looks wet or your skin feels like it’s gonna fall off, pop the nail on and hope it’s straight, and then repeat over and over and over. I guess I could’ve used liquid glue but I didn’t have any handy that day so…. I will say the glue stickers were stronger than I was expecting. They remind me of those little glue dots you get on stuff in the mail sometimes.<br /><br />My biggest beef with these is that they all come with jagged edges on the ends(however they were manufactured I presume) that snag on things and zero instructions on how to file or trim them. Just a tiny cardboard file tossed in.<br /><br />Also, beware if you have small hands, which I do, so I’ve run into this problem a lot. The nail sizes are either a bit too small or too big. There’s no good in-between and you can see the gaps in the pictures. I prefer a little gapping to the plastic overlap digging into my skin. Trust me, they looked worse in person, tho. I was kind of embarrassed to wear them at work.<br /><br />Overall, better than dollar store quality but not by much. Not for beginners due to the hassle. I wouldn’t try again as they only held up for a day. It was the rare color that lured me in.\n",
      "28980->Very thin lotion with an unpleasant initial fragrance | 3 | 0 | I love trying different lotions, particularly those that have nice fragrance, but when I received this set, I almost threw it away!  I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.\n",
      "28983->More fun to play with than use in your hair | 2 | 0 | I will say that the gummy texture is fun to play with.  I find myself squeezing it between my fingers like a little mini stress-ball donut.<br /><br />As a hair tie, it just sucks.  It takes serious effort to get it \"installed\" and trying to get it out safely (without breaking a lot of hair) takes patience and time.  I have very fine hair and I feel like I lost a lot of strands to this thing.  Don't get me wrong - once it's in, it holds pretty well.  If I'd gotten several hundred of these things for the price, I'd just take a scissors to it when I was done with it and not worry about trying to take it out.  If there's a secret to getting this \"super band\" out of my hair with no damage, I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Do your hair a favor and pass on these.\n",
      "28994->Sticks to the case better than your eyelid | 2 | 0 | They stick to the case better than to your eye. I will ise glue the nest time I wear them.<br /><br />They are NOT meant for daytime use unless you are a young thing. I am 56 and these were a bit thicker, longer and less natural than they claimed.<br /><br />I dont believe I've ever complained about anything ever being to long or thick...but there ya have it.\n",
      "28997->Works Great by melting mascara!  All my lashes line up now! | 5 | 0 | This little baby heats up great and works by slightly melting the mascara after you have already put it on.  I didn't find that it was too much heat.<br /><br />Made the several rogue lashed I have fit in w/ the rest!\n",
      "29007->Unbreakable? | 4 | 0 | These simple, unassuming floss picks do one thing that no floss pick has ever done for me before: get through my entire mouth without breaking. Remarkable! They are very tough indeed. The plastic is fine, and the shape is very standard. The negative of these is that the floss feels quite thin compared to the 3M floss picks, for instance. But, if you have problems with floss picks breaking on you--as I do literally every time I use one--these may be the floss picks for you. They are the only ones I've ever used that don't break.<br /><br />Recommended.\n",
      "29025->Brushes don't work for me but my brother likes them. | 3 | 0 | I cannot use the brush at all. I have very fine frizzy hair that is fairly thick with natural waviness. I cannot even run the brush through my hair without pulling so I gave the brush to my brother and he is satisfied.  The brushes work for him.  He has thinning grey hair and the brushes are perfect for his needs.<br /><br />My hair texture is unique so I don't anticipate other people having my problem.\n",
      "29042->Ok shampoo but no thickening of my hair | 3 | 0 | This shampoo is just middle of the road for me. It comes in a bottle that has a little dispense opening on the top, personally I prefer pump dispensers that just make things a lot easier. The bottle itself is actually a bit small, thought it would be bigger especially for the $20 price tag.<br /><br />The smell of it was not bad but also not great. It produced a nice light lather that did a good job cleaning my hair I would say. It didn't feel like it was drying out my hair or anything. I can't say that I noticed any significant improvement on the appearance of my hair in regards of anti thinning. To me it was just a regular shampoo to be honest and for that it was overpriced and the scent not up to par.\n",
      "29050->Curling iron doubles as flat iron! love it! | 5 | 0 | very impressed with this!  It doesn't fry my hair, my hair feels sleek and without static electricity.<br />Also I didn't know it doubles as a flat iron, 2 in 1 product. love it!\n",
      "29068->Different Directions Than Usual | 3 | 0 | I've used a few different foot masks before, and these have very different directions. Most tell you to put them on for 60-90 minutes. These only have you leave the foot masks on for 20-30 minutes. When we used these, we followed these directions. I'm not sure if they would have worked better if we'd left them on as long as we would with normal foot masks. Along with that, the directions say that if they aren't working as well as you'd like, you can use a new mask as soon as 4 days after the first mask. That seems really soon for me. Often, you aren't going to even begin seeing results until about four or five days after you first used the mask. Other brands suggest that you don't use another one for at least a month. That makes me think that these are not as powerful as other foot masks, which could be a good thing if you are concerned about your foot masks being too powerful.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me about these masks was that there was no mention of soaking your feet daily after using the foot masks. Every other foot mask that I've used has included that in the instructions. I'm not sure how well these would work without soaking your feet since my family soaked our feet even though that was not part of the directions.<br /><br />One thing that I liked about these was that they do smell really nice. They have a refreshing coconut scent. Some of the others that I've tried smell a bit chemically or like medicine. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like these worked as well as other foot masks. They are probably a 3.5-star item for me. They are less expensive than the other masks that I've tried, but they don't seem to work as well. I'd be willing to pay a little more for higher quality.\n",
      "29070->THE RETINOL CREAM THAT KEEPS ON WORKING FOR YOUR SKIN | 5 | 0 | I used this with the Eye Gel made by Majestic Pure.  I could not be happier with the results.  I have tried many other gels, lotions, serums and not been happy.  I am 64 years old and can say this did show an immediate younger look that stayed with me.  I did not write a review for several weeks.  The cream continues to improve my skin with each use.  I will be buying more.<br /><br />This is one of the Best if not the &#34;BEST&#34; I have use.\n",
      "29072->Not effective | 1 | 0 | Had high hopes for this one. Used Nivea deodorants in the past, always with positive experience. Not this one. The scent doesn't resemble anything \"fresh\" and personally I don't really like this scent at all. It's sort of warm, mild, grass-like generic scent that dissipates within an hour. Along with the scent, protection goes away as well. I could smell my own sweat after two hours just sitting at work, so 48 hours protection definitely not, especially if you live in hot climate or workout regularly. It's neither deodorant nor antiperspirant. Useless.<br />I would not reccomend it.\n",
      "29076->Keeps Me Dry and Smelling Nice | 5 | 0 | I use this in the morning and it does the job the entire day. This is supposed to work for 48 hours.  I have not tested the 48 hour protection and instead use it every day.<br /><br />It feels fine on my skin and  does not cause a skin reaction. It keeps me dry and smelling fine.<br /><br />It has even worked  well when I have gone out walking. I don't feel the need to put it on again even after I have gotten sweaty walking or doing yard work. I do put it on again after I shower.  It seems work for  people who are active.<br /><br />This feels great on my skin, works even when I get sweaty and has a nice mild scent.\n",
      "29088->Update! | 1 | 0 | I don't remember how many times I've purchased from Neitsi but I've ordered this item at least twice and I've also ordered the human hair extensions and, in the past, I've found Neitsi products to be better than any others in terms of color and, for the synthetic, quality. It was the very best and most realistic synthetic hair I'd ever seen or touched. Until now.<br /><br />The packaging was lovely and the hair was tied with a pretty bow and wrapped in a net. But it was not the same  natural, matte, realistic, Neitsi extensions I've received in the past. I did notice that my order arrived from China and I don't know if the company has changed hands but I'm very disappointed with my order. I would return it but for the price it's not worth the trouble. But I don't think I will ever wear this plastic-looking, shiny fake hair. The color, however is still good for what it's worth. I'm sad that this wonderful brand has gone the way of everything else.\n",
      "29089->Great quality | 5 | 0 | I wash all hair before installing.<br />There was no smell before washing and it maintained it's softness after the wash.<br />I cut the strands in half (Don't like my hair too long) so I had more than enough.<br />I recommend this product!\n",
      "29118->Decent patches | 4 | 0 | I love testing acne patches and my most important criteria is that it works, meaning I have to see it suck out the gunk. The size/width/ingredients doesn’t matter as much to me because what we want is something that will deflate the break out. These ones didn’t work as well for me. It did work, yes, but it didn’t suck the stuff out as well as some of the best acne patches I’ve tested.<br /><br />I’ve seen other reviews mention a smell but it’s just the scent of tea tree oil, and it isn’t even that strong - so don’t be worried about it smelling like anything offensive.<br /><br />Overall these are decent but aren’t the ones I will be reaching for when I need the breakouts gone by the morning.\n",
      "29125->Pleasantly surprised | 5 | 0 | I ended up really liking these. I was a teen in the 90s and loved my scrunchies, so happy to see them making a comeback. These worked well in my thick hair, although the satin ones do loosen up a bit but only because the material is slippery.  You can wear all day without getting that annoying hair pulled headache feeling.<br /><br />I think my favorite are the middle ones, that have a small tail, they look super cute.  They and the long ones are more of a scarf material. I've liked the whole set. Great for the price too.\n",
      "29131->... this shampoo for a few days and I am pretty happy with it | 4 | 0 | I have been using this shampoo for a few days and I am pretty happy with it. It smells goos and works up a good lather. The bottle is a decent size and I find I only need a few pumps to do the trick. After I use it, my hair is soft and smells good. My only complaint is that after a day, my hair feels greasier and not as clean as it does when using my other shampoo. I mostly wash my hair every day anyways so its not that big of a deal, but on those occasions that I might have to skip due to time restraints, I can't really skip, because to me its noticeable.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine\n",

I truly believe honest reviews help shoppers spend money wisely***)<br />They're OK. Not for me though. I think it depends on the size brush you personally prefer. In the beginning I started with #8 brushes & I struggled I learned I definitely need a much bigger brush (#16). So these didn't help me at all but the quality this brush is prefair. theyre more soft than firm (hard to explain what I mean) Nothing spectacular but for the price they're very doable<br />But YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM FOR YOURSELF\n",

On my last trip I had a layover in Heathrow. When you have a layover there you need to go through their version of TSA. I went through and was told this bag does not fit their standards. I had to throw away many items to fit into a much smaller bag. Maybe it’s my fault for not knowing the different standards of Heathrow, but when I read “TSA approved” I assumed it was universal. RIP my shampoo, contact solution, and lotion. 😭\n",

      "29181->Not a fan | 2 | 0 | Too hard to get out of the package and sometimes more come out then I want. Not damp enough, not soft at all.<br />Actually the price was the only thing that led me to try them. Won't be reordered.\n",
      "29190->Pleasantly surprised, love these! | 5 | 0 | These are a really quality extensions! Wasn’t sure what to expect when buying online at such a low price. Got the platinum ones and they’re true to color (just be careful when using purple shampoo, they grab the color more than your own hair). Was worried they’d be too straight compared to my hair, but after washing I realized I could air dry them wavy. Love!!<br /><br />Edit: also cut the bonds in half and am much happier with result 🙂\n",
      "29213->Disappointing | 3 | 0 | Shiner Gold wasn't what I expected.  I expected a pretty stiff hold, after all it says on the can &#34;Heavy Hold&#34;.  That's not exactly the truth.  It's a medium hold, AT BEST.  I have relatively short hair, so I can only imagine how much product you would have to use to get a good hold.<br /><br />I also expected the product to make my hair shine, I mean, IT'S THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT! But I didn't notice any real difference.  I have used other products that had a much higher shine.<br /><br />The can and art work were cool, it has a pleasant smell, it's just not really the pomade I hoped for.<br /><br />It's very possible I set the bar to high for Shiner, but it was disappointing.\n",
      "29214->I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. | 1 | 0 | I loved the ease of use. But the forward and reverse was not labled.<br /><br />I am giving this efile 1 star because it lasted a total of 2 hours over 2 days of sporadic use. I am only doing my own nails.

      "29327->Decently durable; easy to use; could be a bit longer | 4 | 0 | These are reasonably durable mask holder bands. The \"fingers\" that hold the mask straps are thin, but I didn't experience any tearing even when tugging on them a lot harder than they would be exposed to in normal use. The fingers are widely spaced and can deal with flat-style elastic bands without a problem.<br /><br />My only quibble is that they are a bit too short in length. While using them does increase mask comfort around my ears, they would be better if they were about an inch or so longer.<br /><br />Not ideal, but a helpful aid to increase long-term mask wearing comfort especially with masks that have short ear loops.\n",

      "29355->Disapointing shaver | 3 | 0 | My husband is changing from blade to shaver and is looking for one that will give him a close shave. This shaver is not the one. He tried it a few times and he says that the shave is not close enough, that it leaves him with a 5 o'clock look which he does not like.<br /><br />If you like a close shave, this is not the shaver to get.\n",
      "29368->Definitely casual and a bit tricky | 3 | 0 | What I was expecting to get with this was not what I actually got...<br />Still, the real problem is that this hair accessory requires a lot of work, yet produces only a very casual result.<br /><br />The set itself consists of: scrunchy with hair attached to it, a small black elastic tie, and some black hair clips.<br />In order to use it, you put your hair up in a bun with the elastic tie, pull the scrunchy over the bun, then secure it with the pins as needed.<br /><br />The biggest issues I had with this set were the overall quality and the difficulty of use.<br />It also won't be much help to those with very thin/sparse hair because it only makes the end of your hair look longer/thicker, while doing nothing much for your scalp or hairline.<br />You also need enough hair to form a small bun to begin with, which limits the number of women who will be able to wear it at all.<br /><br />The color I selected was a light brown that matches my hair well enough to wear,<br />though not well enough to make it disappear into my hair style completely.<br />Since you are ordering from a photograph, you have to simply use your best guess to decide what the right color for you would be.<br /><br />Other concerns include that fact that the scrunchy shed several strands of hair pretty quickly and the accessories are very chintzy.<br />More likely than not, you will need/want to use your own pins to secure your bun before you add the scrunch element.<br />Personally, I had to fuss with this a lot to get it to look right and stay put; however, I am not naturally gifted in the art of coiffuring, so that may be a reflection on me, as much as the scrunchy itself.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely not recommend this for a formal occasion because it does look very tousled and I doubt that is something you can change.<br />If you are someone who likes to play with your hair, this might be a fun way to create the illusion of fuller hair.<br />Personally, I would rather this set either be easier to use, since it would most likely be used on casual days, or be more amendable to formal hairstyles, so that investing the effort of getting it to look good would feel more worthwhile.\n",

The smoother material kept slipping off my head.

      "29431->iworks but not for the impatient | 3 | 0 | I have uses this on regular polish, glitter, microglitter, no light 'gel' and real gel polishes.<br /><br />It works on all at a logically increasing amount of saturation time.<br /><br />The gel manicure was the longest and required more than 10&#34; of cotton ball soaking (with plastic spring clips securing it). I also had to do a second coating for about 5&#34; to get it off the rest of the way. The upside is that acetone soaking for 10&#34; is harsh on cuticles, where this isn't.<br /><br />For a single coat of polish (light) or strengthener? No wait! IMO, it's a pain that I'd purchase again only for its less-damaging side effects. Another downside was begging to rate them. Product is 'good.'\n",

      "29456->Stopped working. | 1 | 0 | Extremely loud when it did work but it is now June 11, 2019 and is no longer working. I've only used it about 3 times when I first got it so yesterday was my first time using it in a couple months. I plugged it up flicked on the power button and NOTHING.... I tried to get my guy to work it out, still.... NOTHING. So I thought I had the wrong plug so I used my gel lamp adapter which is same circumference inserted it and pressed the power button. Wallahhh... power came on but didn't have consistency, it would come in go out (get loud get low).... I definitely should've tried the one from makkart like I started to. Will update with video soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: My goofy self didnt realize I was trying to use the wrong AC adapter lol. The one to my nail lamp looks similar just slightly different in size where u plug it in lol. Well anyways it still works fine which is now December 6th. So yea it's been a good little minute 😁😄.\n",
      "29457->Nice product | 5 | 0 | I have no idea how I get targeted to try out so many 'women of a certain age' products, but I keep trying them out, and this one is a gem.  I always read the ingredients before I say yes, because I want as few chemicals on my skin.  Perfjohn Anti Aging Snail Extract is full of good things, though I have no idea what snail extract is all about, but the serum is not sticky so I'm not worried.<br /><br /> I've been a fan of Vitamin C products for a while now and I really love how they make my skin feel.  This serum is just as lovely.  It goes on light, and I do have to be careful not to use more than a few drops because this serum really goes a long ways.  Normally I steer away from the department store beauty products because of their heavy scents, and this product does have a light scent, but it goes away almost immediately so it didn't affect my sinuses.<br /><br />I'm only in my first week of use, but it does moisturize well, goes on beautifully, and keeps my skin feeling perfect all day(I tend towards dry skin). The price is reasonable compared to other serums especially the department store brands, so I'm impressed all the way around. While I was given a bottle to try out, I would have no problem buying it myself.\n",

      "29477->How is this \"sanitizing\"? Where is the alcohol at suffient concentration to be a sanitizer? | 2 | 0 | The description claims this is sanitizing, but a cleaning product and a sanitizer are not the same thing.  Sanitizers aim to kill germs directly, which sets them apart from soaps or cleansers, which often work by removing germs from skin rather than killing them.<br /><br />Hand sanitizers need a minimum of 65% alcohol content to be effective against the coronavirus for instance.  For this product to make the claim that it sanitizes rather than simply clean raises big red flags for me, especially  during this Covid 19 coronavirus pandemic when people can't find acyual  hand sanitizers.<br /><br />And when it comes to removing germs from the skin by washing, you not only need soap, you also need running water to flush away the soap and germs.<br /><br />This may be good at removing visible dirt and such, but it cannot replace actual hand washing or real hand sanitizers to suffuciently remove or kill germs.\n",
      "29500->Facial oil with Resveratrol | 5 | 0 | This lipid facial oil comes quite pricey at $70 but it also gives you a large portion of 60 ml or 2 oz.  Most of my serums come in 1 oz bottles, so while $70 is high it is not outrageous.<br /><br />The facial oil is made in the USA and contains Resveratrol which helps combat aging.  Resveratrol comes from grapes and has strong antioxidants.  This Essential Lipid Power Infusion also contains argan oil, rose hip oil, and a mix of extracts.<br /><br />I found this Essential Lipid Power Infusion to stay on my skin for a relatively long time. It left my skin feeling a bit greasy but once absorbed it felt very soft and well hydrated.  I agree with the other reviewers that recommend using this in the evening because of the time that it takes for the oil to be absorbed.\n",

      "29541->Gentle effectie cleanser, made in Korea | 5 | 0 | This jelly facial cleanser from Vitamasques is made in Korea.<br /><br />The tube has a foil safety seal under the white cap. The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn’t linger.<br /><br />A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn’t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it.<br /><br />And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don’t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked.<br /><br />I’m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all.\n",

      "29554->So far, so good | 4 | 0 | It arrived yesterday. It turns on and spins around whichevr little widget you have inserted. I tried it on smoothing down the rough skin on my bunions and the back edge of my heels. Reason I got it was to be able to remove my own powdered acrylic nail treatment, because the salon I go to charges extra for that. If I go in with already bare nails, I can save six bucks. Not time yet to try that, so will have to wait and see.<br /><br />As far as all the stuff that comes with the drill, there are three separate containers under the blister insert with the extra bits, and they are all hard to open -- I take that back: the two little plastic boxes are hard to open (I thought I would have to take pliers or a hammer to one of them), and the pink thing containing the &#34;surprise&#34; gift is a cute container with so much stuff in it that it cannot possibly close properly - so I took everything out of it and carry it in my purse when I figure out what I want to put in it.<br /><br />I kept going back and forth between 3 stars and 4 while writing this review but settled on 4 just because the drill is pink and does not look like a piece of hardware.\n",
      "29559->Good for clarifying but questionable ingredients | 4 | 0 | I have color treated hair that I've been dying for about 8 years now and I have to really maintain it to keep it healthy and looking smooth. I learned some time ago how much better my hair looks when I use Argan Oil treatments and would do them once a week or so to make my hair super soft and pretty. I started using shampoos and conditioners with Argan Oil when I saw how well my hair responded to it. Some brands left my hair feeling heavy and oily so I really wanted to find a good clarifying shampoo. I started with just a little bit so I could gauge how it would work for me but once I lathered it up in my hair I realized how much a little bit can cover. I don't need nearly as much as I do of most other brands. I washed it that night and followed it up with my regular conditioner, another Argan product. My hair felt really clean. I have a lot of hair and at the top I couldnt feel the heaviness and resistance I had been from over moisturizing. The smell was ok, I like something that is stronger and prettier, this one just kind of smelled like soap, and it faded quickly after It was dry. As long as my conditioner smells good I don't mind it too much but if you're planning to use it alone you might notice. I think it worked well for getting it clean without leaving it dry or feeling like straw. I don't feel like my hair is as soft as with most Argan Oil shampoos, at all, but I think it'll be a good one to use intermittently to clear the buildup from all of my oil rich products.<br /><br />I was surprised and disappointed at the ingredients list when I looked. From a company called InstaNatural that boasts this as a holistic treatment I didn't expect to see so many chemicals. I would have preferred more familiar ingredients, and natural, obviously. Argan oil isn't even listed until the second to last ingredient. I like how it worked but I'm not sure how hard it would be on my hair if I used it regularly.<br /><br />I did receive my shampoo at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product, whether it be positive or negative. I welcome both positive or negative feedback as well. My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions of this shampoo.\n",

      "29593->Good for Holding Hair in Place......  As a ponytail holder, no. | 5 | 0 | I do find these hair clips quite sturdy!  I have been using them to hold a pony tail. But not as strong to hold a ponytail on securely.  The teeth are very small,  and there is no grip of the hair.  The clip will fall.<br /><br />Many years ago,  I had a ton of hair and now,  sadly,  it has thinned out.  I now can use hair clips to hold the entire hair.  I like that the clips look simple,  they are not bulky and fit easily on my hair.  I usually use one  and/or two on the pony tail.  I can wear this clip on my hair in public and it is not very visible.  I am getting a lot of use right now.  I like the clips!  The Clips will hold a ponytail,  but eventually will slide.  Just use it for holding the hair back in place.\n",

The packaging is beautiful and I can not wait to treat myself to a relaxing bath with these!<br /><br />12/29/16 Update:<br /><br />So I've had time to use a fair number of these bath bombs since receiving them. My only real complaint is that they don't really fizz or bubble to the extent that many other bath bombs do, but I was prepared for that when I placed my order because I had read quite a few reviews on these already.<br /><br />The scent is sort of hit or miss depending on which bomb you're using. Overall they could all stand to be a bit stronger than they are.<br /><br />The saving grace for this product is that they make my skin feel super soft! Which I love.<br /><br />The botanical pieces don't really bother me the way it seems to bother a lot of other people apparently. Yes, if you purchase these your bathtub may require a bit of cleanup if the pieces don't wash completely down the drain after your bath. Be prepared. This is a natural product, so you're going to get bits and pieces of the plants that were used in their creation. I personally enjoy that.<br /><br />Would I purchase these again? Meh. I like the way that they make my skin feel, but I will probably look at other options in the future.\n",
      "29658->I was able to get these at a discounted sale price and quite pleased with them | 5 | 0 | Since I am getting back into a more of an organic lifestyle, using more things organic for my skin as well, I figured I would try my hand at making some lip balms. I was able to get these at a discounted sale price and quite pleased with them. I got the blue colored ones. You get 12 of them in a nice tidy box. The caps snap on easily but do not pop off-they stay on! They twist up nicely too. They seem to made very good-way better than some solid white ones I bought at my local craft store. When I used those, the warm/hot mix seemed to make them feel flimsy. These right off the bat are a thicker feel. Plus I think they will look much nicer. The translucent body will show off my balm! They are a standard 5.5mL size like most lip balms sold commercially. Like I said I am very pleased with my purchase!<br />Even though I got these at a discounted price, I am under NO obligation to leave a review. I am leaving my review based on my honest opinion of the product. Once I use these up, I will get more. For 12 of these, the price is cheaper than the ones I got at my local big name craft store!\n",

I did go on the purchase page to see that I needed 2AA batteries. There is one part that I still don't know what it is for. I did a test and it did work and I am happy with that but instructions would have saved time.<br /><br />The box comes with the collector. It has two little tools include.

      "29671->Nice set | 5 | 0 | I have four daughters aged 6,5,4 and 11 months. So we can truly never have enough bows. Every chance I'm given to try new ones, I take it. So I of course ordered these when I seen them. Upon arrival I was very pleased with them. I absolutely loved the packaging especially the box the bows arrived in, which can be used for storage when not in use.  We took them out right away and couldn't have been happier. These bows are made very well and seem to be very sturdy. The colors/design are very nice and put together well. The colors are great and they should definitely match with anything you may need. The ribbon on these is of nice quality and it shows. They are infact the size mentioned in the add, which can sometimes be a surprise upon arrival. They are on alligator clips, which was exactly what we were wanting. These particular clips have grips on them which make them even easier. They stay in place with no problems, even during rough play. One of the best things about these is that they are very light weight. Lighter than most of our bows, especially for the size. These have a soft of silky-ness to them which I have found helps tremendously when trying to clean them. I use a baby wipe and have no issues wiping off anything that has managed to get on them. I'm so glad I found these and we were able to try them out. I have  no doubt that they will last a while to come, being they are made so well. I'm completely happy with my purchase and I will be recommending them to my friends and family. These would make a nice addition to any little ladys bow collection.<br /><br />I received this at discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review (good or bad) NO one nor nothing influenced my opinion and all the above statements are my own personal experiences\n",
      "29682->Bad packaging. Some items were broken. | 2 | 0 | Product is fine. I was familiar with the hand soap and love it. The problem is three out of six of the hand soap bottles were broken at the top. Soap just poured out without a spout to direct the soap because it had broken off. I used the one from my used bottle to make it work. I can't fix the others because I only had one and Amazon doesn't have any more of this product.<br />They should have been packaged better and not grouped together. Very disappointing.\n",
      "29724->Vitamin C serum with a slightly thick texture, takes a little time to be absorbed | 4 | 0 | I'm always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands.  I'm new to this American brand MD Complete but found the Vitamin C serum nicely packaged and high quality.<br /><br />I use different serums in the morning and at night. This Vitamin C is a little thicker than what I usually use and is feels a bit oily -- but going on it is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy.  I would use it at night though.  It felt deeply hydrating and the Vitamin C helps brighten and even out skin tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but did not experience any irritation, sensitivity or redness using this product.\n",
      "29756->creamy semi matte finish, bold, bright pop of color, fades w/ drink & food, smudges | 4 | 0 | Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word \"matte\" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all. I find that it nearly matches a bold lip tint that I like by \"I'm Meme\"<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091GSRN78/\n",
      "29761->Handy convenient pack of tweezers | 5 | 0 | I love this little pack of tweezers. I can carry it in my backpack and always have it. The tweezers themselves are good quality and fairly heavy duty. I also really like the cat on the front lol<br /><br />Happy customer\n",
      "29775->So Far, So Good | 5 | 0 | These have been working well so far. I mainly ordered them to scrub my face so my tinted moisturizer goes on more smoothly. I have combination skin that has both black & white heads plus dry skin. When I ordered these, I expected them to be half the size. So for my intended purpose, they are a bit of overkill. Once they are fully wet, they get a lot thicker & fluffier. In order to get my nose properly scrubbed, I bend the loofah & use the bent edge. It works.<br /><br />I hang these to dry on a copper rod that is just small enough to accommodate the little hanging loop that these have on them. This then hangs in front of a window which gets a lot of sun. It's a great way to get them to dry & to help fight bacteria.<br /><br />I hope they are 100% natural. I read in one of the questions that it has a foam core. I'm not too sure what to think of that. Really, with all the Chinglish & poor spelling, what should one think aside from, \"Oh, it's yet another made in China item being sold on amazon.\" For the record, these loofah's will not \"remove horniness\" OMG, they really need to get someone to clean up their listings LOL!<br /><br />Overall, I'm really surprised by the quality & the size of these esp. after the lack of quality control in the listing. When you order stuff online, you never know what you're going to get. Time will tell how long they hold up for. I expect/hope they last a long time.\n",
      "29777->Lovin' Those Tips | 5 | 0 | If you don't want to think about having to touch up your liner all day, and I mean ALL day, you'll love this clever eyeliner.<br />Dual tips means you have one product that gives you 100% precision.<br />If you like to get artistic, if you like to play with your makeup, those tips are so much fun and you can create so many looks. From slim cat eye to thick Cleopatra.<br />Very nice, definitely a keeper.\n",
      "29796->Great for curing whatever! | 4 | 0 | I must admit, I do not use this conventionally -- rather than curing polish on my nails, I use this to cure UV resin and nail polish on flies (the kind you fish with!)<br /><br />Most fly-tiers use a UV flashlight to cure one fly at a time, but I can stick several flies in this UV lamp and cut down on time spent.  The timer function is especially handy.  Based on the lamp's performance on my flies, I wanna say it should work wonders for fingernails.\n",
      "29809->Technically, it works... But.... | 2 | 0 | The brush for this thing could put an eye out with one false move. It's so stiff and pointy.<br /><br />I will say this. The good thing about the liner is that it is VERY magnetic. The bad thing is repositioning the lashes. The liner does not adhere to skin well. Even after the long drying time, and properly washing my face it just doesn't like sticking.<br /><br />I ended up returning this item because I don't want to have to fight with something this novel. Hopefully the company develops the formula.\n",
      "29826->Not just organic | 5 | 0 | It's like having your own Aloe plant in a bottle because the first ingredient is Aloe. We do have an Aloe plant in our home.  The bonus is the vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid (improves skin elasticity). This works great on sunburn!!!<br /><br />In a pinch you can use this and mix with isopropyl alcohol (30/70 mix) and make hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This really well packaged to prevent leakage in transit and you can reuse it to keep little fingers from depressing the product.\n",
      "29838->Meh | 2 | 0 | This product line is hit and miss with my son's hair:<br /><br />• Thick<br />• 4B-4C<br />• Low porosity<br /><br />I waited to review this product after using it for a month and it did not yield the results I was hoping for. I do believe the photos I've seen that appeared to have more success were kids who had 4C hair or who were biracial. The 4C hair photos just looked average - no wow factor. I'm not too fond of the smell and it's not entirely clear what's recommended after shampoo and conditioning. Half of the bottles have a numbered system. After shampooing and conditioning; I add the oil and curling cream (which does not work as well) thoroughly rub in and my son's hair just looks milky/cloudy. However, the mousse which I use later in the week appears to enhance my son's curls better than the curling cream but leaves it feeling extremely stripped.<br /><br />Also some of the items leaked upon arrival. Tried to support BOB but I had a unfavorable experience.\n",
      "29872->Disappointed left skin dry. | 2 | 0 | First time I used it left my skin feeling very dry. I have used Perlier products before and I have been very satisfied.<br />So this thourghly surprised me.<br />It left me disappointed.<br />I won't recommend or purchase again.\n",
      "29881->Great exfoliating face wash for men with very little scent | 4 | 0 | My son likes this face wash because it does exfoliate well. However, I don't like that it has very little scent to it -- I expected a clean, fresh scent-- and it is a fairly small bottle for the price. I like the simple, masculine packaging.<br /><br />All in all, this is a perfectly good face wash, particularly if you prefer something with very little scent.\n",
      "29901->Good product but containers not full | 2 | 0 | Some of the bottle containers were not full<br />Package was in track\n",
      "29903->Why this is a good value... | 5 | 0 | This is pure genius.<br />After unscrewing the top of the cap, you'll see the film that protects the batteries. After you remove it, put the top back on and separate the light unit from the jar.<br />The red LED light will be activated by pressing against your skin. Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br /> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br />After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br /><br />So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.\n",
      "29925->No. | 1 | 0 | My hairdresser had masks like this on, and I really wanted to try some, and I settled on these...<br /><br />Mistake.<br /><br />They are too short to cover your mouth! And they brush on my lips while I’m trying to talk. Maybe for a kid it would work, but not an adult.\n",
      "29944->Lovely moisturizer for wrinkles | 5 | 0 | This FillUp by EasyDew is a great cream that I personally really like a lot. First of it comes in a stunning squeeze tube that has a one of those interesting tips for a more concentrated spot application. This pretty silver tube will look great on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive less than $25 so for me this one is a winner.\n",
      "29945->Bristles not secure. | 2 | 0 | The 1/2\" barrel was good for my short hair.  And it was slow to heat up but finally became hot enough.<br />But after a couple of months I noticed 1 row of bristles is missing.  Now another is loose and will slide out.  Too cheaply made.\n",
      "29948->Containers are Nice! But the Clear Bag Broke Easily. | 4 | 0 | So these containers are really easy to clean and put product inside.<br />I even put mouthwash inside the squeezable container and it was fine (I did put it in a ziploc bag just in case though).<br />The only thing is that the clear bag the products came in broke right away, but I didn't really need it.\n",
      "29966->Creamy texture; nice fragrance; takes a while to absorb but is hydrating – 3.5 stars | 4 | 0 | I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words \"balancing cream.\" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream. I like it but not enough to order it again.\n",
      "29968->Great Argan Oil and Shampoo | 5 | 0 | I have color treated hair and am always looking for a good product to use.<br />The shampoo comes with a nice pump and smells wonderful.  It is not too overpowering smelling.  I have used it four times and each time I feel more and more of a difference in the softness and hydration.  It has become glossier as well.  And the smell is amazing.<br />On to the oil ~ I am in love with this stuff!!  I started applying the oil right out of the shower.  It says to start with a few drops, but I apply about a quarter size. I was afraid it would make my hair really oily, but it doesn’t at all.  It adds so much shine and moisture.  It really helps the frizzys and dryness.  I LOVE how my hair feels after I apply it.  In fact, the first time I applied it my son asked me why I kept petting my hair.  So I put some in his hair and he started doing it too.<br />I also love that they do not test on animals.  This is a big factor for me when I am purchasing products.<br />Overall, I am very happy with both of these hair products.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "29992->Soft brush not great for coarse hair | 4 | 0 | The brush comes in a tin which is useful to keep any remaining oil/wax/conditioner on the bristles fresher.  Overall, great quality.<br /><br />With that said, the bristles are quite soft.  My hair is coarse.  It works \"okay\" for brushing on any sort of conditioner on it, especially the waxy stuff.  But it doesn't work so well for brushing my beard.<br /><br />I'm sure it would work well for people with thin hair.\n",
      "30000->Not so good | 2 | 0 | This is a very soft eye pencil. I am not crazy for the way it smears, breaks off when drawing a line.<br />When i use it, I find the point breaks.<br />I will not buy this again.\n",
      "30006->Thin but very good quality hair | 3 | 0 | LOVE the hair itself, very real curls and straightens perfectly, no unnatural shine<br /><br />Dislike that they’re so thin but that’s what i expected based off of reviews. There’s only 4 strips of extensions. I also don’t like the size of the strips. Two are VERY long (longer than my head ...\n",
      "30007->I don't get the hype, sub-par shave. | 2 | 0 | I do not understand the hype of Harry's razors.  My first issue as an 'in the shower' shaver is that the grip is not that great.  The rubberized handle really is not that grippy and the contours of the handle do not really offer a naturally secure hold.  Kind of a bulky, rounded handle that offers no secure contour to grab onto.<br /><br />The real issue that I have is that I think it offers a pretty lousy shave.  There are 5 blades, a moisture strip and some other strip that makes it a bulky head that feels like I'm dragging a razor paddle across my face.  I find that it does not offer a very close shave and I have to go over spots numerous times and still I will sometimes realize later in the morning/day that I have a rough spot somewhere that was not cleanly shaved.  Particularly along the jawline where my face is more curved and not so flat.  The bulkiness of the razor head is also a nuisance for shaving mustache area, you can't get a close shave under your nose, you have to use the single blade detailer side which I don't care for using on the front of my face.<br /><br />I do like their shave gel, it smells nice and makes for an otherwise smooth shaving experience.  Not in this kit but so I can offer some other praise to Harry's is their peppermint face wash.  I bought some of that too and have enjoyed it.\n",
      "30027->Very cheap | 2 | 0 | I like the color and how easy it is to use.<br />I do not like how cheap it was made. they just zip tied a wash sponge to a stick. it has not come apart yet but I feel like it might soon.\n",
      "30032->Don't waste your money | 1 | 0 | I bought this because I've seen brow stamps all over social media and thought I would give it a try, huge mistake. Although it is easy to use it looks so cheap and cheesy! I laughed so hard when I looked in the mirror. This does not look natural and wipes right off so even if it did look good the powder comes right off.<br /><br />My daughter has kids makeup that is better pigment and quality. I'll stick to my Maybeline brow tatoo.\n",
      "30033->This item comes in a nice package. The pump is very convenient compared to ... | 4 | 0 | This item comes in a nice package. The pump is very convenient compared to most of the other serums I have that come with the dropper. It has an orange smell that I'm not really fond of.. but it is light so it doesn't bother me enough for me to stop using it. I have been using for 2 weeks now I and notice that my skin tone is not as uneven. I have acne scars and tons of freckles.<br /><br />I got this item at a discount for my honest unbiased review\n",
      "30050->alignment tape does not stick | 1 | 0 | The protector itself is nice however the alignment tape provided does not stick to the protector.<br />Absolutely ridiculous trying to align protector to phone. Would have been easier if they provided nothing.\n",
      "30051->Purchased as a gift … | 5 | 0 | My mother in law loves lavender smelling things.<br />I have the rose one and love it, so thought the lavender one would make a nice gift for her.<br />The formula is nice, not sticky, and the smell is not overpowering.<br />This brand has the most affordable products and so far I have enjoyed everything I’ve bought.<br />The packaging is really nice too. Very sturdy and pretty.<br />My mother in law seems to really like it.\n",
      "30059->Update: from ok to subpar | 2 | 0 | I will probably use this but won’t buy again.<br />The product has a smell like baby powder like most cheap products do. Usually I hate this smell but it is a little more subtle here. The hydration is also a little better than cheap products. I don’t think it’s worth $12<br /><br />Update: been using this product for about a month now and am shocked at how bad this is... it dries out my skin within hours worse than if using nothing.. avoid\n",
      "30073->Not worth it | 2 | 0 | These are flimsy and not worth it at all. I wish I hadn’t tested a couple so I could have returned them. They are super flimsy and could not possibly hold hair out of your face.<br /><br />Spend the money to get something better, don’t waste it on this.\n",
      "30077->Not great | 2 | 0 | I was really hoping I snagged a good one but this one is off the mark a bit. The blades tend to snag a little bit when cutting the hairs so it pulls a little when it cuts. I also found that it doesn't contour to the face all that well even though it has the ability to flex the blades. It also just comes with a USB cord and no plug so you have to hunt around for a plug to use. I didn't get to test the battery life as I only used it once and my face was as shaved as it was going to be with this razor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not great. It does do an ok job and if it's set within your means, it will work for the time being.\n",
      "30083->One Star | 1 | 0 | Could not tell any difference after using it 4  times<br />Plus snail mask isn't  for everyone<br />Causing allergic reaction\n",
      "30091->Nice product.. But I wouldn't call it magnetic eyelashes | 3 | 0 | It was made with love, It was nicely packed, and the quality is good. There is only one problem: This is not magnetic eyelashes since you need glue to put them on. The only magnetic parts are the baby lashes. The baby lashes are very small pieces, groups of 3 singles lashes, that you can add on the main lashes after you applied them with glue. But the whole point with magnetic eyelashes is to not use anything! just your natural lashes as a sandwich.<br />I have returned them, sorry!\n",
      "30094->Amazing mask! | 4 | 0 | I tend to think that all masks are basically the same, but I was truly blown away by this one. WOW. My skin looked amazing after this! I popped this on an hour before a Zoom meeting, and I got compliments on my skin. (And I am in my 40s.)<br /><br />This stuff is magic. The serum sinks right in. I didn't even have to wipe any of it off and it left my oily skin moist and lovely.<br /><br />However, the only drawback is the price. Make no mistake: This stuff is expensive.<br /><br />Still, if money is no object and you want something that actually works, check this out.\n",
      "30104->Best there is | 5 | 0 | I have suffered from chronically chapped lips my whole life and I've tried every chapstick, balm, and treatment out there. This is THE best. It has no irritating ingredients and stays on a long time. I don't bother with anything else anymore.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I just replenished my supply at Aveda for 8.50 each with free shipping, so I'm not sure where this price is coming from?\n",
      "30125->Buyers remorse | 1 | 0 | They look semi nice, no rough edges. But they are super super thin! The adhesive pads provided are a joke! They don’t work at all. Expect to destroy all the adhesive trying to get it to stick to your nail and peel away from the backing.<br /><br />Buyers remorse on this one :/\n",
      "30128->You get what you pay for | 3 | 0 | I bought these to give the magnetic lash trend a try. I love the packaging, I love the scent of the eyeliner. It was fairly easy to apply them. My problem is, after wearing them to work the first time. The eyeliner \"melted\" or \"loosened\" from the natural oils that occur in the corners of my eyes. They would not stay \"connected\" in the corners which was very uncomfortable for the rest of my shift. When I came home and removed them one of the magnets came off 🤦‍♀️ and since then I have been unable to wear them comfortably.<br /><br />So basically, good for one night use and good for people who don't have to deal with extra oils forming around their eyes and \"smudging\" the magnetic liner. I will look for a better set now.\n",
      "30131->Be careful! | 1 | 0 | My Shaklee rep informed me that it is dangerous to purchase items as this anywhere other than by a Shaklee representative. That is the only way we can be assured that we, as consumers, get a safe, fresh, clean product.<br />Shaklee has been around for many years (google it) and they want their customers to be 100% satisfied. Please be careful with what you put on your skin, as it is absorbed into the body as well as what you take orally. Ultimately it is your decision, but sometimes it’s not worth it to save a few dollars.\n",
      "30132->Cut out wood area frayed catches hair | 2 | 0 | Overall a nice brush only issue is the oval carved out area was not sand down before inserting the pad holding the bristols. It snags hair while brushing. Defeating the purpose of tangle free and not damaging strands. If they only put the additional time to smooth out the jagged frayed parts of the wood this brush would of been perfect.<br />Smooth it out and add $1.00 or two and it would be 5 stars.\n",
      "30137->It's ok | 3 | 0 | It's great that it comes in a 5 pack so many family members can benefit.  The top part and handle of this scrubber set are made of plastic while the spindles are silicone.  The all-silicone scrubbers feel sturdier than this set.<br /><br />It's smaller than some of the other scrubbers I've used, and the spindles are also shorter.  The handle design does not lend itself to being hung on any hooks which I didn't realize I'd miss until I used this version.  The small handle is fine for kids to grasp.  Overall, I might have liked this set a wee bit more if I was able to hang it on something, but it still functions the way it is intended.\n",
      "30139->doesn't do the job | 3 | 0 | The product doesn't do the job as far as a pre-shave as doesn't go on that great and when shaving<br />is like nothing was put  on. Disappointing and there are other better ones out there.\n",
      "30146->Didn’t last long. | 3 | 0 | I liked everything about it, except the plug-in just connecting on right side, since my bedside table is on my left side so cord ran across me. I loved it, but after about a month of nightly use<br />it just stopped working.\n",
      "30154->Magnets not strong. Messy Eyeliner | 1 | 0 | I saw all the reviews and wanted to love it<br />so badly but its either I got a faulty batch or it just doesn't work as well ..cos I bought a different brand and u could actually feel the magnet pull in to snap in place.<br />This one appears to be held together more by the stickiness in the eyeliner.. Also the eyeliner makes a big mess and is very hard to wipe off. Disappointed\n",
      "30157->Caused severe irritation, burns, and an open sore | 1 | 0 | I used the foot peel mask a week ago and followed the directions exactly as printed.  Within a few hours of using this product, I started to blister on the top of my left foot and on my right outer ankle.  Over the past week, the affected areas have worsened, and it is quite painful.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend this product!\n",
      "30185->good and bad | 3 | 0 | this product was not for me<br />It is very hard and scratchy. It felt like there were exfoliators in it and it didn't seem to go on smooth. I have very sensitive underarms so i need something that glides on more easily and smoothly.<br />The scent was great and disappeared after a short time, but i never got smelly at all. It didn't leave any residue or ever make me itchy. It definitely did its job and this is a good product. But, just not for me.\n",
      "30187->Lightly Exfoliating Soap | 5 | 0 | I enjoy using Zum Bar Goat Milk Soaps and this one is no exception. It is very nicely scented and has a slight exfoliating action due to what appears to be bits of seaweed in the soap. I can't guess what the essential oils are in this soap but they are heavenly. I noticed the scent of this soap is very calming. Love it!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "30194->Completely Ineffective | 1 | 0 | I tried this twice. The first day I warmed the mask for 30 seconds in a microwave, applied it to my hair, put on a plastic cap, and left it in for 6 hours. There was absolutely no effect whatsoever so the next day I did the same thing but only left it in for 5 hours.<br /><br />But again, there was no effect at all.<br /><br />I'm in my early 60's and use Just for Men hair color, but I'm lucky my hair is till very long, and not in that bad of shape. It's a bit dry and frizzy though, and I'm really surprised this product did nothing whatsoever to help.\n",
      "30197->Poor Quality | 1 | 0 | To begin with, the zipper broke on the second use. The blue plastic inserts came out the first time I put my fingers through. I was okay to live with the above 2 issues but once I started using the scissors (primary reason to buy this) for a home haircut, realized that it was taking more effort to cut the hair than the included scissors from a clipper set I had bought. The scissors were a let down as well and that was not acceptable.<br /><br />Will be returning this set.\n",
      "30238->Great Foot Callus Shaver! | 5 | 0 | This is a great value device that works really well! It came charged, but I plugged it in the wall and charged it before using it.

      "30251->Will clean the dirtiest of all places. | 5 | 0 | These are not the typical run of the mill body scrubbers. These really work!<br /><br />I love being able to get a good scrub down in the shower. While most shower loofah's are very soft, and barely fell anything, these are not like that. Of course it matters how much pressure you apply as well.<br /><br />I like it how they are quite long as well, where I can grab both sides of it behind my back and give my back a good scrub. Oh, and 3 pack? yes please.\n",
      "30258->Meh... | 2 | 0 | I had to changed my rating from 5 stars to 2. The sponge didn’t last long, it came apart quite easily. It’s also hard to get into the nooks of our body with it. I ended up using them to clean my walls.<br /><br />The gloves were just ok, too. They didn’t last as long as the ones I usually get. I’m a bargain shopper but in this case, you get what you pay for.\n",
      "30276->BUY this stuff, it works! | 4 | 0 | I have tried many, many deodorants, both &#34;natural&#34; and poisonous throughout my 51 year lifespan.  This deodorant is by far the best one in terms of eliminating odor and the longevity of doing so.  Only the higher price point precludes me giving it 5 stars.  I have been using this brand, scent free, for over 6 months.<br /><br />As for the burning, rash, irritation.  I did experience some initially, but that can usually be attributed to the &#34;detox&#34; effect of your previous deodorants, etc. . .\n",
      "30289->My skin went from dry/dehydrated to oily after using this toner 😔 | 4 | 0 | The sedum extract in this essence was quite intriguing to me.  As someone with chronically dry, sometimes dehydrated skin I thought this toner could help me.  \"Sedum is a succulent leaf known for its intense hydration, vitamins & mineral level.  It holds more hydration than watermelon and is rich in phytoestrogen that further boosts hydration and improves the skin condition.\"  When I read that, I thought this sounded like the recipe for perfect skin, but every time I use this essence my face turns super oily.  I have never experienced this kind of change from any of the hydrating essences I own.<br /><br />The scent on this is light, clean, and fresh, very herbal.  You should be aware that this product is fragranced with natural fruit oils & extracts.  A few minutes after application though, the scent dissipates quickly.  My skin is crazy reactive & very sensitive, but I did not experience any adverse reactions to the ingredients used in this essence.<br /><br />There was also a generous amount of samples from Celimax included with this toner.  😀  They sent 2 Noni ampoules, 3 serum packettes, and 2 AHA/BHA exfoliating/brightening pads (labeled for underarms, but can be used elsewhere).  Korean brands are so very gracious with samples!  Thank you, Celimax! ❤<br /><br />Both the package & bottle both come safety sealed.  The bottle is of nice size (150ml) and features a shaker style spout for easy dispensing.  I pour a small amount of the essence into my hands, then pat into the skin after cleansing. Then I apply my serums & moisturizer.<br /><br />Though I don't find this product to be a particularly good fit for my skin right now (during the hot & humid Florida summer heat, when my oil production is already at it's peak), I think this essence may work better for me in the winter.  I do think it's a nice product, so it still gets a 4 star rating from me.\n",
      "30299->Great enzyme face wash | 5 | 0 | This Japanese pharmaceutical company-made face wash can build very mild and silky foam.<br />The enzyme face wash can deeply clean the skin without irritation.<br />I have sensitive skin and tend to have dryness or itchiness after washing my face but not with this face wash.<br />The price is fair as imported thought.<br />I like it and recommend it to people who have sensitive skin!\n",
      "30324->None drying face masks that smells amazing | 5 | 0 | I have a few products by Higher Education and like the majority of them. This clay mask is fantastic. It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.\n",
      "30326->It’s moisturizing with great scent for sensitive skin for men and women | 5 | 0 | All 3 bottles arrived undamaged and for using this for the first time I’m in love with the coconut vanilla scent. I will definitely order it again and try the other scents as well.<br /><br />This works great for my Eastern Asian skin type that doesn’t cause my body to get over oily nor does it dry me out or feel like I just used commercial grade floor cleaner on myself and it moisturizes my skin and leaves a wonderful scent my wife just loves on me. Not to mention I like the look of the bottle giving it a nice modern minimalist look that will go great with any bathroom type.<br /><br />I definitely won some brownie points with my wife trying this one out.\n",
      "30334->SLICK SELL | 1 | 0 | we were expecting a much larger bag for $6.50, i usually pay $1.50 for what they sent,  this candy was not even fresh<br />...REAL SLICK... DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMend\n",
      "30352->Hope you have enough strength | 2 | 0 | I am afraid to snap these / they are so hard to clip on and off..<br />Wouldn't recommend.. waste of money\n",
      "30359->Easy lip stain good for travel | 4 | 0 | Very easy to use, Color’s are bright on application, usually last around 3 hours but less if you are eating.  Watch the initial drip from the cotton bud though when the color drips to the bottom of the bud and can stain.<br />I read numerous reviews on the nude colour being orange, I didn’t find this on the undertone of my lips, it was more of a natural red for me.<br />I wished the stain lasted longer but great for travel or out at night, saves taking a lipstick when you can put it in a small bag or pocket.\n",
      "30364->Soap and Vanilla Combined (B Grade) | 3 | 0 | If you like the scent of vanilla mixed in with soap, this body wash is for you. It creates a nice lather but it doesn't have that natural smell and more along the lines of chemical. But it does an okay job.<br /><br />Katiebabs\n",
      "30374->Awful | 1 | 0 | I was so excited about this purchase and was so sure I'd at least like 1 of the 3 items so at the price I ordered 2 sets HUGE MISTAKE...  I think the eyebrow pen would have been awesome if it was brown black, or black or even actual dark brown but it has a red tint to it and just a weird color,  I have dark but thin brows and I think if this color was closer to my Natural brow color it would have been awesome,  same with the brown powder,  just a weird shade of brown and the eyeliner is definitely not even close to smudgeproof or waterproof and to make matters worse only 1 of the eyeliners wasn't completely dried out and it's almost dried out after 1 atrempt at using... I'm so disappointed and mad at myself for paying for 2 sets and none of it is usable for me!! I'm just going to chalk it up to a loss, it's not worth the hassle of the return process so I'm just out the money for 2 sets!<br /><br />IF you have red hair or brown hair this might be okay for you but the reddish tint looks ridiculous on light black eyebrows\n",
      "30385->It's a No Show | 2 | 0 | I wear a color similar to this Linen Kiss daily and ordered this to replace my dwindling supply.<br /><br />To be honest, it doesn't show up on my skin at all.  Even if I try to 'build' the color, it's just not there.<br /><br />There is very little pigment in this color. Perhaps one of their darker colors has more but, for me, this isn't a keeper.<br /><br />I do love the individual packaging because I use more of some colors than others but this one, unfortunately, does not work for me at all.<br /><br />I hope this helps you.\n",
      "30392->Surprisingly good for the price | 4 | 0 | For the price, I'm genuinely surprised with this nail drill. First of all, it doesn't suffer from the two major issues most cheap nail drills face: lack of torque and internal wobbling. A lack of torque is when the rotation mechanism stalls out if you press hard enough against the nail. You'll know a nail drill has internal wobbling because it will almost tickle or feel uncomfortable when you file your nails.<br /><br />With that being said, here's what I don't like: I prefer much thinner nail drills. Even if you \"choke up\" your grip onto the thinner part of the drill it's still thick enough to make my hands tired if I'm using it for longer than a few minutes. I can't imagine this being comfortable to use all day in a nail salon. Next, the instructions. It took me way too long to figure out how to change the drill bit, partly due to the vague instructions and partly because I had to use so much force I genuinely thought I was going to break it. The twist mechanism is misleading. You turn it and it stops so you think you're done turning it but in actuality you have to keep turning it until you hear a click.<br />It also would be nice for the manufacturer to explain the differences between all the drill bits and what the intended use case is for each one.<br /><br />FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN'T CHANGE THE DRILL BIT:<br /><br />Turn the top portion of the drill toward the side labeled \"R\" until you hear a click (this is important) use pliers and pull out the drill bit. You'll need to use more force than you think.<br />Once you've removed the drill bit, stop turning the top portion of the drill toward \"R\". The mechanism will go back to the center by itself. Pick your desired drill bit and put it where the old drill bit was. Turn the top portion of the drill towards the labeled \"S\" until you hear a click to secure the drill bit (The drill bit WILL fall out if you don't twist it towards \"S\" until you hear a click).\n",

      "30422->Lovely scent, thick cream | 3 | 0 | Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have normal skin with some sensitivity issues.<br /><br />Pros: I like Aubrey Organics since it gets high scores from the GoodGuide.com (6.5/10 overall). This particular lotion has a lovely floral scent. It is rich and creamy and it left my skin feeling smooth and soft. It is also reasonably priced especially considering the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Cons: The consistency is very thick, more like a cream than a lotion. I felt like I had to use a lot of product to get good coverage.  It also contains alcohols which can cause problems for sensitive skin. Plus, its hazard score is a little high for my liking (5 on ewg.org/skindeep).<br /><br />Overall: A lovely scent but too thick for my liking. My search continues . . .\n",
      "30493->What You See is NOT What You Get | 3 | 0 | Just received this item.  I won't be using it in the shower -- just wanted to hang it when needed then put away, in my RV.  So, I can't attest at this time to how resistant it might be to fog or shattering.  However, when I received was not exactly as pictured.<br /><br />There is 1/4 inch deep and 3/4 inch long notch cut out along the right lower edge as it hangs.  I don't see this as a problem or that it interferes with the function.  It's just I wonder why the photo and what I received was not identical.  In today's media market, it is not hard to post a correct photo or show variations of a product.\n",
      "30509->Not impressed | 3 | 0 | Lately, I have become enamored with hair building fibers for both root and scalp coverage. The results have been amazing, and many of the products I have used contain Keratin or Gossypium as the primary ingredient. The Toppik Hair Building Fibers contains 99% Keratin, but the fibers were larger and coarser than others and did not blend or adhere as well. It wasn't the natural-looking coverage I had come to expect. Just goes to show they're not all the same.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **\n",

She prefers a good old fashion rubber band for ponytails.\n",

      "30532->Great for moisturizing during the winter months | 5 | 0 | My oils arrived in bottles with security seals beneath the lids. Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in an amber colored bottle which is the best way to store them.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with these types of oils, they are not scented. Neither oil has any type of scent at all and they are meant to be used as moisturizing products or carrier oils.<br /><br />Overall: really nice set of oils that are fresh and in the right type of bottle.\n",
      "30568->Doesn't work well | 3 | 0 | So on mild discoloration this will probably work well.. like a dudley nose or nose that might have a little pink tinge. If you are putting over a pigmented nose that has very pink skin.. don't bother wasting  your money. This does not work for that. The color from the solution is very light and isn't enough to cover pink skin.<br /><br />Applies best with qtips. Be careful and apply while pup is on a table. You may need 2 people to help. They will immediately want to lick their noses so keep in mind you may need to hold them and let that first coat especially dry and set. The 2nd coat set much faster for me.<br /><br />I wouldn't purchase again. My poor puppy is perfect except a tiny pink spot on her nose. That's enough to most likely keep her from ever finishing, even though it's a minor fault in her breed. Such a silly thing to fault a parti colored dog for, but I digress. If you're in my same boat, try something else.\n",

      "30623->Read review inside for deets | 3 | 0 | I love the wand on the full size bottle. It’s weighted at the handle which gives it amazing control, excellent idea.  But the small bottle is not.  The larger bottle however always gives me raccoon eyes.  It is not sweat proof at all.  I live in south Florida where it is humid and during<br />The course of a regular day it smears.  I don’t rub my eyes so I don’t understand that.<br />The waterproof also seems to smear a tad.  But I cannot yet be certain it’s not leftover of the regular.<br />Disappointed but love the shape of the wand, a little jiggle while applying from<br />The base up and it applies beautifully and keeps my lashes from clumping, which is a miracle ... yet it doesn’t stay on well as noted above.\n",

I am also impressed with the overall build quality and with the end result of what my stubble beard looks like after using it. Without doubt the best trimmer I have ever owned.<br />I have had it about five weeks now and it is still running on it's initial charge eventhough I use it 3 times a week.<br /><br />Two minor complaints:<br />1) I wish it had some kind of stand so it would be neatly propped up on the vanity where I use it.<br />2) It may be a little on the bulky side for travel. If Norelco makes something similar a little smaller, and with a little travel bag plus charger, then let me know.\n",

      "30717->VERY small | 2 | 0 | The quality of this wig is fine, and I liked that it had straps to make it adjustable, but even on the 'biggest' setting this wig is INCREDIBLY small. It's uncomfortably tight, and even with a wig cap it doesn't cover my natural hairline. It was a lot shorter/less poofy than the image but maybe that could be fixed - I didn't bother because I had to return it.<br /><br />I actually have kind of a small head, I often have to wear child's size sunglasses and hats because adult sizes are usually too big. So I can't imagine who this wig would fit. It's too small for my 10 year old too.\n",
      "30723->This product works great! The only inconvenient part about it is | 4 | 0 | This product works great! The only inconvenient part about it is, it seems that you have to take off the nail polish one layer at a time. I had 2 layers of black nail polish, and it took me 2 tries to get it all off. The first try got the gloss off, and then the rest came off like a dream on the second try.<br /><br />I had to take one star off, because the suction tube that came with this product absolutely sucks! I mean, it does not hold the liquid in there AT ALL. Everything just drips right out of the tube. I ended up wasting a lot of liquid because of this. I will probably have to use a different one instead.\n",

      "30742->Provides subtle, consistent improvement. Effects aren't striking -- but it works. | 4 | 0 | I received a discounted sample of this product to provide a review on amazon.<br /><br />I am a healthy 64-year old male with skin that appears tighter and healthier than that of many peers. While I tanned during the first half of my life, I phased it out during the second. I only use lotion under my eyes where skin is noticeably loose and darker than the rest. Over the past five or six years -- part of this is genetic -- the skin at the front of the neck has become especially loose, while the furrowed lines on my forehead have begun to look alarming. I wanted to try Puressant Neck Firming Cream to see what effect it might have on these two issues.<br /><br />After a three-week trial, during which I applied the product at least once per day, I've seen a subtle but real tightening of the skin on my neck, which appears to have reached maximum effect. I will assume that to continue this trend I might have to use the product indefinitely, but received no indication from product instructions about this. In any case, there are few products I use indefinitely and particularly those with such an extensive list of known and unknown ingredients. Having said that, I might use the product at intervals to reduce symptoms periodically.<br /><br />The product has had no effect on my wrinkly forehead, at least not yet. I'll just have to live with it.<br /><br />The cream has a clean, subtle fragrance (I wish it had none) and rather heavy consistency: A little goes a long way. I've not yet noticed any staining of clothes after application nor any side effects. If not for its moisturizing qualities, I might have awarded this product three stars, but it generates enough cosmetic improvement at a low price to merit four.\n",
      "30765->Average Product | 2 | 0 | The feature to change barrels is nice, and they heat well. But that's where the features stop; there's no rest on the main unit to rest while it's hot, the cord is thick and cumbersome. The pouch is cheaply made and rips easily. There are similar products with the same features and perform just as well for a lower cost.<br />Won't recommend.\n",

These are stickers you can just peel them off. Tweezers might help, but I just used my fingernail.<br /><br />These stickers are really neat, and have a goth/Halloween aesthetic. They peel off with just a little bit of work, stick on well and don't ripple easily.\n",

      "30864->Decent scissors and hair clips | 3 | 0 | Overall, I would say that out of this small hair cutting package only the scissors, thinning shears, and hair clips are decent quality. The scissors are made out of stainless steel but when using them you will notice that they wont cut as smoothly compared to more expensive higher quality scissors. The shears worked perfectly fine for me and they did the job well.<br /><br />Everything else provided in the package is more like the 3 star hotel freebies that are cheap and poorly made. The cape is only good for a few times before it will most likely rip apart and the combs provided were bend on arrival.\n",
      "30885->seems promising, will continue to update (added Edit below) | 4 | 0 | Interesting array of ingredients. The predominant scent (and minor, initial flavor) is that of seaweed, since that it the primary ingredient. It doesn't come back up in burps like a fish oil can.<br /><br />I have been taking this for 2 weeks now. I did not immediately start with a full 2 caps does as I wanted to make sure that I could tolerate the new ingredients. I can. So then about a week in I began taking two caps. I know I have forgotten a dose or two, but I am through 2 of the six blister packs, and just starting my third. I am embarking on a multi pronged approach to my massive shedding cycles. I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an \"off shedding cycle\", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks. BUT I'm not too far off, so maybe?! I am keeping track, so I will be back to update as I go. Currently, I feel fine taking this, and it never makes me feel nauseous.<br /><br /> It is a 60 capsule (30 day) supply. Easy to pop out blister packs of 10 capsules, 6 blister packs total in a cardboard container. The pills are a typical sized basic soft capsules that could be opened up and added to food or drink.

Upfront expectation to really know if it is working seems to be around 3 months-- which would be true of any product of this nature.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT: Within the one full pack of use (some skipped doses), I can tell there is less hair fall. This makes the first benchmark accurate. \"After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling\". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, \"After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen\" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).\n",
      "30887->Just eh | 2 | 0 | I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy and this was recommended to me as I have been taping my eye shut for the past two months. There are definitely positives and negatives to it. Overall, I wish the string was more comfortable and that the foam was slightly sticky so that it would adhere to my face so it wouldn't move around as much.<br /><br />Positives - overall it does work. I am able to function for a lot longer than I could with the drops alone. I had to add a drop of liquid in order to really get the 'humidity' in the patch to start to build up. Honestly, I'm going through a lot so crying is not abnormal right now so that happened on its own.<br /><br />Negatives - The string is VERY uncomfortable. It really needs to be much thicker so that it doesn't cut into the skin. I wasn't able to sleep with this as the only protection for my eye as I move around a lot and because it doesn't stick at all I would have knocked it off easily.\n",

The nozzle has a spray tip that can come loose and end up lodged in your nose. | 1 | 0 | I tolerated these poor performing devices because of the good price, but when I had part of the nozzle come loose and lodge in my nose, that was enough.  It took a lot to blow it back out, was almost stuck in my nasal cavity.  No nasal mister is worth that risk.<br /><br />On top of that, these leak if they are not upright.  Carry them in a bag or a pocket?  They leak.  They also don't last long enough to dispense the fluid in them - the nozzle literally wears out and becomes non-misting pump that barely works.  Spend the extra 30 cents and get something that works.\n",

I was really looking forward to the vacuum feature but doesn't work particularly well for me.  Sure, it collects some hair, but plenty more ends up on the sink and the floor.  I was hoping to make trimming a no-cleanup operation.  Alas.<br /><br />Beyond that, seems to work as advertised.  I haven't had any problems with it yet, but I don't think there's much advantage to it vs my old, clumsy trimmer.\n",

This face cream is a little on the richer side (but not super rich and thick to where it is hard to soak into the skin). It is a little on the oily side but the thing is now that the colder/fall/winter season is coming, this is the perfect face cream for the season. I would not recommend this for use during the hot summer but your skin will drink this up in the cold. The scent was light and pleasant, but that always comes down to personal preference as some people are very sensitive to smell.<br /><br />It says this cream has collagen and stem cells, but I’m not sure how much of those ingredients are used in the formulation. It would be nice to know because if there is too little then there is probably very little anti wrinkle benefits. As with all beauty/skin care products it takes time to see the results. Overall this is a good face cream if you just want something moisturizing for the face but I can’t say yet if this will help erase or prevent any wrinkles.\n",
      "31012->They are large and strong enough to hold long thick hair. | 5 | 0 | These big hair claw clips are amazing! My wife has thick hair and other hair clips are just not large or strong enough to hold all of her hair. These however are large enough and strong enough to hold all of her hair back.<br /><br />You get a nice variety of 12 different colors and they come in a pretty purple box. They work great for clipping back all of the hair, or in small sections as well when straightening.\n",
      "31020->Nice Facial Roller, But No Instructions for the Two Crystal Bottles | 3 | 0 | Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the roller alone, but the lack of instructions prevent me from giving this set more than three stars.\n",
      "31028->Beautiful - Using It In Promotional Photos | 5 | 0 | I run my own eco farm full time. I ordered this because I thought it would work really great in some photo props & it does. The \"leather\" sections are synthetic but still look good. The beads are wooden. There are two dyed green pheasant feathers & some really excellent quality rooster saddle feathers. The two silver beads that you use to adjust the size of the headpiece are plastic. The dream catcher section feels like cotton, it is a pretty blue color that compliments the peacock feather perfectly.<br /><br />It's very earthy & very natural, just what this dirt loving tree hugger farm girl loves.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased.\n",
      "31032->Save your money | 2 | 0 | So many things wrong; where to start.  First of all, the image portrays a nice silicon object that fits over your toe and provides both the toe separator AND cushioning for a bunion.<br /><br />The toe separator piece is HUGE and uncomfortable.  The silicon bit that is SUPPOSED to provide cushioning just flaps around even with socks.  It is very bulky as well.<br /><br />IF you choose to order one of these, many of these are being sold on Amazon from sellers based in China.  A giveaway is the 2-3 week shipping time.\n",
      "31034->Trouble fixed | 3 | 0 | Came out the box broken! I’m so upset litterally broken in two places the shelving and the chip on the side. Also the chip wasn’t in the packaging so it was obviously packaged already broken. So it’s useless and am returning<br /><br />Update to 3 stars since they sent me another one and this one came perfect and has held up great ! I’m happy problem was fixed, thank you.\n",
      "31053->Very delicate, but feels great | 4 | 0 | It feel amazing on the skin, but be careful! It’s very delicate, and it could break easily.<br />I don’t like the handles they’ve attached to product.\n",

      "31111->EXCELLENT PRODUCT! | 5 | 0 | I've been using this product for about 2 decades. I started using it because I really couldn't find anything<br />that would hold my hair in place. I ran into problems when the drugstores stopped carrying it. I had found<br />an alternate supplier of the product, but they stopped doing online business.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was extremely happy when I saw that I could purchase it  on Amazon.\n",

      "31168->Nice scent | 4 | 0 | This smells nice. It's so warm and comforting. It doesn't last super long but it is affordable enough to reapply it through the day without breaking the bank. I accidentally put on too much at one point and for 15 minutes or so until it dried down it kind of smelled like Pine Sol. I think this oil is kind of temperamental. I'm going to be really careful about how much I put on at once. It might be best for soap and cleaners.<br /><br />The packaging looks cheap so if you want to give it as a gift you might want to take it out of the shrink-wrapped box and put a ribbon on it or something like that.\n",
      "31169->TO MY TRIBE SEARCHING FOR NEXT BEST HERBAL ANSWER | 3 | 0 | Many of us are still searching in vain for the great Blistex Herbal Answer, which was discontinued. I think I bought a quantity a couple of years ago on Ebay for a ridiculous price (which has only gotten more $$$$ over time).<br />So I did an exhaustive search and decided to order this. It's possibly the best of the Blistex options for Herbal Answer but it's not great. For me it doesn't stay on very long, and I miss the flavor and smell of HA.<br />If anyone finds a better substitute than this I'd greatly appreciate you leaving your comments!\n",

      "31189->Not worth trying | 2 | 0 | Pro:The staying power was great, never smudged.<br />Cons: wasn’t much liquid in the pen; only got a few uses out of it. When I did manage to get the liquid out, I had to apply a lot of pressure, which caused the rubber tip to collapse so I was never able to get the individual hair-like look that the applicator tip is supposed to provide.\n",
      "31193->Not worth it | 1 | 0 | It came broken at the brush part they wanted me to send it back for a refund I have no printer so I'd have to drive somewhere and pay to have it printed then drive to a ups dropoff and I'd wind payin more in gas than the item is worth waste of time and money<br /><br />Update ball on other end came off during use. Waste of my money\n",
      "31213->Very pretty and nice, delicate work | 4 | 0 | This is a really good hair band.  Mind you it is quite expensive too perhaps because of the delicate work that is done on it.  Now the work looks really nice, it is made out of metal and colorful crystals. The finish of the work is very good - it very neat and tidy. The hair band color is white which is prone to getting dirty.  Hoping that machine wash will work very well with this hair band in case required.<br /><br />One downside of this necklace is that it is really heavy.  As in quite a lot heavier than other such hair bands.  To me it looks like that is the weight of all the metal and crystals that have been used to construct this hair band.<br /><br />Also, the hair band overall is very tight too.  This hasn't been worn just yet for a longish period of time so not sure if it will cause a head ache or will be ok.  Will update the review once I've done that.<br /><br />Overall very nice hair band\n",
      "31214->Nice product, great value, wrong description | 4 | 0 | These are pretty, and for the price you can't complain much.  The patterns are as pictured.  But I have one major gripe, which is that only three of them are satin!  Another three are chiffon, and the last two are some sort of close weave with a flat, smooth finish.  I assumed that for $8, the \"silk\" part of the \"soft silk satin\" description was obviously a mistake, which was great - I don't want silk.  But I really did need satin.  If you weren't relying on the fact that the description clearly says SATIN and nothing else, I suppose it would be a nice variety of fabrics.<br /><br />They also arrived with a strong smell, sort of like rubber, which is a bit annoying when combined with the fact that there are no wash instructions.  I suppose you just throw them in a delicates bag and hope for the best.\n",

Don't waste your money. | 1 | 0 | I'v been using hair extensions for few years now, this is the worst among all.<br />Hair always tangled very fast I tried everything including keratin serums nothing enhanced the quality of the hair. Has to comb through every few hours not to mention shading is extreme. Not gonna last for a month or two Max. See photos 🙄<br />The only thing I would recommend is the hidden wire style which you can find with a better hair quality. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "31227->The actual size & the label. The size is a lot smaller that is depicted in the sellers picture | 1 | 0 | The label is different that the picture & description depicted by the seller.<br />Deceiving. Buyer be aware.\n",
      "31228->Melatonin and Water May Disrupt Sleep Cycle; Seems to Firm and Hydrate Skin | 3 | 0 | The NeoCell overnighter collagen comes with about 20 servings in a $34.95 bottle, or about $1.75 per serving or day.  The blueberry pomegranate flavor is not really perceivable as such; the flavor is sweet and artificial.<br /><br />Collagen is supposed to moisture the skin and make it more elastic. However, intake of collagen in food form until recently was thought to be ineffective.  This product does actually seem to firm, hydrate and restore my wife's skin.  It has gaba and melatonin, so my wife tries to not take it prior to 20 minutes before bed.  After starting this product, she's been having to get up during the night to use the restroom, because this is to be taken with 8 ounces of water.  She would prefer to have this product in pill form, and to not have it include melatonin, which can help one fall asleep sooner, but may disrupt one's sleep cycle. So this product did not work well for my wife.\n",
      "31239->Nice gift set! | 4 | 0 | I got the set with the insulated tumbler cup that says “Beauty begins the moment you love yourself.”  The outside of the gift box says “Thinking of you.”  This would make a really nice gift set for someone who is going through a tough time.  It includes a small scented candle in a glass pot with a metal lid; the tumbler cup with a washable straw and brush; a wine bottle stopper; a cute key that I think must just be a decoration; two bath bombs; and a bar of rose-scented pink soap.<br /><br />This particular set is listed at just under $35.  I think that might be a bit high for this.  But if you are looking for a convenient set that you don’t have to put together yourself, this is a nice set.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you!\n",
      "31248->OMG YES! | 5 | 0 | Finally, I am able to do my own manicure at home. I call it the cheese grater..lol but it's really not abrasive at all. I soak my feet in water for 10min, then I use the big foot scrubber to remove the hard dead skin on my heels and top inside sides. It works great. Does the job. Then I finish off with coconut oil that I purchased from amazon.<br />Leaves my feet feeling soft. So glad I got this. Overall, easy to use, durable and works great.\n",
      "31251->A tiny bit is all it takes. | 4 | 0 | I was a bit disappointed when I saw how small the tubes were, but I discovered that I only need a very tiny, pin-head sized dot to add just the right amount of color to my face.<br />Two of the three colors are too pink for me, but the one is just right.<br />Very pleased.\n",
      "31261->The best thing about this is the jar it comes in | 3 | 0 | If you look at the photo attached you’ll see that the package has a spot that reads “Don’t be put off by the pungent odour! It’s just the strength of the Valerian Root. (It disappears when in hot water).”<br /><br />I believed that message. I should not have believed that message. It smelled like old gym socks left in a locker for a year and, while the taste was not as bad as the odor (or odour, if you’re Australian) it wasn’t very pleasant either.<br /><br />As a food scientist/chef I always look back at my mentor telling me “It ain’t nutrition until it passes the lips”. It doesn’t matter how healthy something is, if someone won’t eat it or drink it, it can’t do them any good. Taste matters.<br /><br />Taste is subjective and you may not be offended by the taste, I was.<br />As for its effectiveness, I can’t really say. There is literature that backs up to some extent, the claims made and it very well may help calm you or help you get to sleep. Then again, the same can be said for a cup of warm decaffeinated tea. Perhaps this is better than that but I’m not drinking it.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice, it would make a nice gift for someone who is into this type of product. The painted glass jar is nice as well (the cap is plastic).<br /><br />For what this costs, they should have at least used better tea bags; asking that the bags have strings w/ tabs on them, or that they are made of a higher-grade paper, shouldn’t be too much to ask when a teabag costs more than $1.00 per.<br /><br />Again, the taste is subjective, you may like the flavor or, at least, not find it offensive as I did.<br /><br />Review of: WelleCo - Sleep Welle Natural Calming Tea Caddy\n",

      "31271->Very nice face serum by Merlot | 5 | 0 | This is the third product I have tried by Merlot and I also like this one, so 2 out of 3 is not bad. This serum is packed with peptides, resveratrol and grape seed extract.<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this and what you apply quickly absorbs into your skin. It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.\n",

I don’t know whether they changed or my skin changed.<br /><br />Old review:<br />I tried the cereal version. It's a perfectly good foam wash, but not that much better than less expensive options.<br /><br />The bottle is misleading, too. The grains at the bottom are decorative and enclosed in a bottom. The pump will not draw the liquid from that bottom section, and since I could not get the top unscrewed, t felt as though some was wasted.\n",

      "31352->WOW Amazing stuff! | 5 | 0 | I was searching for something with Volufiline and found this inexpensive  tube.  Thought I would take a chance with it being much less expensive than others I found. It was delivered  on time and packaged really professional  and nice. I couldn’t wait to dab some on my eye areas. I went back to the mirror about  30 minutes later and almost every bit of puffiness  was gone. So, I dabbed a little more around the area and much to my surprise, my eye area looked like I just had botox!  I have used it going on almost 2 days and have already ordered more of their products.  Going to see how the Gold Milk Steam Cream 200g does on my mature skin along with the Pancoat Pop Vita gloss+lipstick+tint works out.<br />These are Asian companies and made.. Just as the Manufacturer  describes  - \"Cheap and works” . It has a nice soft aroma that goes away quickly as it is put on the skin.<br />I am shocked that there are not any other reviews for this product...<br />For the price and quality, so far I am super pleased and would recommend this product to others.\n",
      "31359->Works, but not good for sensitive or dry skin | 3 | 0 | This mask I didn’t like as much as the other three charcoal ones I’ve tried. It does clean pores very well and help draw out impurities and grossness. I had a few emerging tiny blemishes and after using this they came out, healed and disappeared within two days. HOWEVER, it’s extremely drying, even on areas that weren’t dry to begin with. Also, this is the most painful one to peel off -in my personal mask history. Messy too, but all black charcoal masks are. Follow immediately with a good face moisturizer or oil.<br /><br />Don’t know what the “use by timeline” is on these things, but this one doesn’t hold out so long. I’ve been using it about once a week for four months (in between cleansing and washing, then moisturizing), but recently I found the formula lumpy and congealed, making it very hard to apply.<br /><br />In the description a money back guarantee is mentioned. That’s definitely a plus because, while the cons may outweigh the pros, I think it’s worth a try. It may be better for oilier faces. Since mine went bad though I’ll be tossing it.\n",

      "31392->Not a bad facial serum but does make your face somewhat tacky | 4 | 0 | This is an interesting serum for your face. The bottle comes in this interesting dropper bottle that only shows the dropper when you unscrew the cap. The serum is a milky kind of solution, so make sure you mix it well before you use it just to make sure it is well mixed.<br /><br />The serum is kind of thick but absorbs quickly into your skin. Your skin stays tacky for about an hour or so. After that it becomes fairly nice and soft.<br /><br />The serum does have a scent to it but I can't describe it. It is fairly nice though so no complaints there. I have had no negative skin reactions or issues when I used this product. This to me is a little over average.\n",

      "31411->Probably works well depending on your skin type | 3 | 0 | My husband is the one that used this because he was going through a rough patch. He is more prone to acne than I am and recently he's been getting more and more breakouts. I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />\"So like many people i have been wearing a mask all day. It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.\"<br /><br />There you have it. That's what he thought about it.\n",
      "31424->Cheap | 3 | 0 | I won’t buy these again. The bottles are minuscule & not worth the money.<br />The colors are pretty and vibrant, but pretty thin and it takes at least 3 coats. I expect a little more value.<br />I covered mine with the gel topcoat for longevity.\n",
      "31425->Nice Set of Shears | 3 | 0 | This set of shears have a good weight to them and are beautiful to look at. The issue is that they needed to be sharpened. I can tell they are made with quality materials, but the opening and closing of the shears is janky.<br />But a sharpener should be on hand anyway with scissors like these so the fix should be easy\n",

      "31431->Good replacement for the extinct Bullfrog Surfer Formula | 4 | 0 | I was a long-time user of Bullfrog's Surfer Formula. Bullfrog discontinued it, and the replacement didn't come close in ease of use and effectiveness. I did a search, hoping to find a hidden BSF supply. None to be found, but I saw a reference to Doc Martin's Nextgen. Hmm.<br /><br />I decided to buy it. The product arrived. My first reaction was a little skeptical: 2 ounces isn't much!<br /><br />I gave it a try the next day on a hot, sunny day. A little bit goes a LONG way, so 2 ounces should last a while. It is very easy to apply, and even has a pleasant scent. I was out in the sun 5 hours with one application, and didn't have any burn. It didn't run until I got a surprise face bath, and then I had some run-off in my eyes. But I haven't had any eye run-off otherwise, even on long, hot, sweaty, muggy days.<br /><br />Doc Martin's Nextgen is a good substitute for the late Bullfrog Surfer Formula: it's easy to apply, it works for hours and hours, it stays put, but it's easy to remove when you want to remove it. I expect to be a repeat customer.<br /><br />A pleasant surprise was receiving a personal e-mail from the seller checking on my satisfaction. Old-school customer service, which I appreciated.\n",

      "31498->Barely Made a Wave | 2 | 0 | I have been trying, for well over 30 years, to get a curling iron that actually did what it was supposed to – curl my hair.<br /><br />Hot curlers – no good results<br /><br />Curling Irons (¼, ½) – no good results<br /><br /> Wrap-Around Fabric Curlers – nothing there<br /><br />I saw this and thought it couldn’t fail. Simple to use – plug in, turn on, heat up, section hair, and use – put hair in, count down.<br /><br />Works in theory, fails in execution. First up – there is NO heat seating guide for SAFE curling. THIS DEVICE IS CELSIUS (C) ONLY, NO FARENHEIT (F) OPTION. Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: “For those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100°C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit. Any higher and your strands may burn. For those with coarse or thicker hair, have your curling iron set between 200 degrees and 300 degrees (148.9°C or on this device 150) Fahrenheit for optimal curls” [9 Curling Iron Secrets You Need to Know About/Redken]<br /><br />Using that, as well as Glamour’s 8-10 second rule [How to Curl Your Hair Correctly: 7 Mistakes to Avoid – Glamour; “Drill it into your brain: You should hold an iron on your hair for eight to 10 seconds max”], along with using thinner groups of hair – I should have SOME wave. Nope. I even went 25 seconds. Nothing.<br /><br />As my hair has become a bit thinner, has been color treated, and exposed to SO much – I wasn’t about to turn this up hotter.<br /><br />The curler is designed much like a crimper, but the “width” can make it difficult to handle, especially by yourself. There is a “guard” which heats up as well and it is easy to burn yourself.<br /><br />It wins with innovative idea as well as the digital temp gauge. Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself – this is a two star deal.

I actually purchased two Identical pair, except one was 6.5&#34; and one pair is 7.5&#34;. I wasn't sure which size would work for me, so I bought them both. I will give one pair to my daughter. I actually prefer the 7.5&#34; best for some reason, it just feels more balanced in my hand. Both pair cut equally well though.  I enjoy trimming my cut between visits and I'm pretty good at it.  It actually saves me a lot of money and allows me to visit the salon less often.  Also I sometimes trim my daughters hair and my boyfriends hair.  I have several  beauticians in the family (even though I am not) so I've learned the basics.  I got the scissors in quickly and packaged well.  The scissors fit my hand well, but I have smaller hands and fingers. I had no issues with that at all.  I also enjoyed that the scissors are crafted of fine stainless steel and are easy to manipulate. I purchased them for testing purposes. The pair I received open and close easily and with no issues.  The scissors were sharp and cut cleanly.  I am enjoying the scissors and believe they are a very good value. As I stated previously I am not a professional beautician, but for me, using the scissors at home they are perfect.  I have no complaints or issues and the product I've tried is working very well for me.\n",
      "31530->Instant glamour | 4 | 0 | I really like these press on toenails for special occasions in the summer.<br />After you finish a pedicure, you can glue these on, then slip into your favorite open toed shoes.<br />I would just keep three things in mind before ordering these...<br /><br />1st, sizing is tricky. Turns out toenails vary widely in shape and size.<br />I was able to make my set work, but one of the nails looks wonky.<br />If you were getting these for a hugely important event like a wedding, I might order the two sizes closest to your toes just to make certain you could get an absolutely perfect fit.<br /><br />2nd, these do not last as long as press on fingernails (at least not for me).<br />I am lucky if I can get these through a whole day without needing to reattach one of these nails.<br />To be fair, I am a bit of a klutz.<br />That being said, I think it's more a product of how much wear and tear most feet get on an average day.<br />You also tend to hit your foot harder, so one stubbed toe and you're going to have an issue.<br />The good news is these are super easy to reattach, plus you get a few spares to replace any nails that are completely lost.<br /><br />3rd, preparation is critical to getting the most out of these nails.<br />Getting or giving yourself a pedicure before applying these is not just about making sure your feet look their best, the cleaning and buffing is necessary to get the best bond from the glue tabs.<br />You do get a little file to help you with this; though honestly, most people will prefer to use their own tools.<br /><br />I really like these as a way to show off shoes and feet.<br />Attaching them takes very little time and the end result is quite elegant.<br />Still, I would consider these best for special occasions, not every day.\n",

      "31609->Like a Less Forgiving Old-Style Pencil | 3 | 0 | I'm an eyebrow fanatic, and I've used eyebrow wax, powder, pencils and stencils. I'm a huge fan of shaping and powder - that seems to work best for me - but I've never seen applicators like these so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />Mine didn't arrive overly wet like those of other reviewers; they just seemed to be like normal pens. But the application was uneven and I did have to press hard to get any color other than simply a dark shading (like the side of a lead pencil).<br /><br />Once I did use firm pressure, it was a little like using an old eyebrow pencil - but less forgiving with the multi-levels. Be sure to shape your eyebrow first, then apply the pen; don't expect the pen to comb as well as draw. The pen can provide the dramatically even look, or, with a lot of manipulation, a more natural look (which I prefer).<br /><br />I didn't find the pen to be as long-lasting as expected.  I try to be really careful in application, as I don't like to abuse my eyebrows or skin, and remove product only using makeup remover.  However, I do perspire on my t-zones  and that perspiration completely defeated the eyebrow pencil.<br /><br />This is an interesting innovation with the four-tier brush - and it may work well for others, just not for me. Ingredients, which I so appreciate being noted on the box: water, acrylic ester copolymer, propylene glycol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, c177491, c177492.\n",
      "31613->skin feels instantly hydrated, soothed, supple looking. EGF | 5 | 0 | I fell in love with Easydew products awhile back. I do tend to use and try all sorts of products, but I have a short list of products that I really like for me. Easydew is on that list. Easydew is also a brand I trust. I just sense that it is doing what it says it is going to do. Budget friendly too. They dont use frilly words and overinflated promises. They just seem straightforward with science backed ingredients. I like that a lot. I think all or most of their products include EGF (epidermal growth factors) which I am keen on for skin repair and health.<br />I haven't used an easydew product yet that I didnt like or love. This Repair Control Renewal lotion always feels so good on my skin. I love it for my simple skin days. It has so much going for it-- addresses a multitude of concerns- and is gentle. It is one of those lotions that just make the skin look and feel good immediately. If you have dry skin, their toner is pretty great too.<br /><br />My skin: 40 something, dry skin. Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight \"mask\" or occlusive.\n",
      "31616->Good opportunity to try a lot of different products | 4 | 0 | Review for: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit With Ultra Gentle Lotion, 1 Count<br /><br />I have been a fan of Burt’s Bees products for years. I welcomed the opportunity to try this assortment.<br /><br />I found the bubble bath to be a good product for my household. Lots of bubbles, no scent that I could detect and an easy to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is fine as a body wash and I love the foam dispenser. It works ok for an infant as shampoo but I don’t like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are great and I like the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thin as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could not discern any scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a tad into a bath so soften and moisten the skin. You do have to be careful not to put too much in or the tub will become a slip and slide.<br /><br />Overall: Nice products, not perfect but would make a nice gift, comes in a gift box.\n",
      "31621->Great product...works for me in Europe | 5 | 0 | I searched quite a bit for a great facial hair trimmer and I have not been let down with my purchase of this one.  The vacuum works great...it doesn't get every little hair, but there's hardly any clean up.<br />Some reviews said that this would not work in Europe, but mine works fine.  Of course you have to have an adapter but the razor itself is 220/110 so it does the converting of the power...so I don't need a transformer/converter, just a plug adapter.  Makes it still very convenient to travel with too!<br />Lastly, battery life is very impressive.  It holds a charge for a long time inbetween trims (I maybe trim 2x a week and only charge it every 3rd week or so).<br />All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to someone else too!\n",

      "31709->super uncomfy and does not do much | 2 | 0 | Let me tell you, unboxing this mask was the funnest thing I have done, I did not realize I knew so many lines from the movie the Mask or Man in the Iron Mask. It is a mask made of plastic with a piece that goes over your neck. There are USB plugs that go into the mask to power up the mask. it has a remote control, directions for use and a strap on the mask to loosen and tighten.<br /><br />There are different color LEDs and the lights flash at different speeds, this is an annoying feature when this thing is on your face.<br /><br />This LED mask is easy to use but so very uncomfortable to wear. I tried it a different tightness and with out the strap and it was just uncomfortable around my eye area.<br /><br />I used this for a few weeks and saw no changes but I could not wear it for over 5 minutes at a time. I am still going to try to use it and see if I can get used to it but I am not sure it will do anything for my aging skin.\n",
      "31713->Unique Mask for All Ages | 4 | 0 | This MagiForet Star Mask is meant to help firm, lift, and tone your face. As I age I don’t mind the wrinkles or even the age spots. What I do mind is my sagging skin. Yes, having jowls terrifies me. This Star Mask was more comfortable than I thought it would be. You put a layer on and let it set between 20-30 minutes until it is completely dry. Usually, I can only stand to wear a mask 10 minutes, but this mask was so comfortable that I dozed off with it on. I woke up just in time to remove.<br /><br />Removal was a little difficult and made me wonder how tugging on my skin actually helped with firming, toning, and lifting. I’ve only had a chance to try this mask once so I cannot say that it’s going to keep the jowls at bay. What positive results I did have was my face was so soft and bright after removing this mask. Best of all my overly sensitive skin wasn’t irritated in the least. It is a mask that I am going to incorporate into my skincare routine and hopefully, the jowls never appear.  You need such a small amount of this mask that the 1.7 fl oz jar should last you through many maskings.  Also, the jar is so pretty it can sit on your vanity and no one will be the wiser that you have a black glittery gel inside.<br /><br />The only thing I didn’t like was the glitter was uncomfortable during application. Some of the larger sized glitters would catch and scratch your skin until they laid down. Not to the point of marks or blood. Just an annoyance.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a reduced price for testing purposes. .\n",

I have super dry skin, and it felt replenishing.<br />-This cream provided great coverage despite it being a thinner consistency.<br />-I put it on my face to even skin tone on “no make up days” and I also use it with my normal make up routine.<br />-The price is very fair for the quality.<br />-This cream has high SPF, so it is perfect for summer days. Sun screen is an important part of skin care routine, so it is nice to have the BB cream and sun screen combined.<br /><br />CONS<br />-This BB cream might be too dewy for oily skin. It is perfect for dry skin though.<br />-This made my fine lines stand out more if I didn’t blend it in super well.<br /><br />There are more pros than cons to this BB cream. I would order it again.\n",

I figured I could make her hair grey. I started out with not much product in my hair and it went across the hair really good and left grey streaks as if she was naturally going grey. It looked really good. But I wanted all grey hair and so I kept going. Her hair is chin-length, so really not that long. This turned into a mess. It didn't look natural anymore and it was clumpy, etc. If you want a product to add some grey strands to your hair this is great. If you want to look 100% grey, this won't do it for you. I was surprised by the shininess of it when I opened it, but when it went on it really looked very natural.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below.\n",

I wish I had returned it since I can’t use 3 of them with my boys due to girly colors, no way they would accept pink and purple . So I am updating the review as the flip top cap breaks off and the container is useless.<br />I have boys and my complain is the colors:<br />The item works and it came empty, but we filled with our favorite sanitizer and it is super good to hang at back packs and lunch bags. However from the 6 we could only use 3 due to the colors, it came more pinks than shown and for families with boys this is an issue. There is no way my boys would accept pinks and light purples in anything that they have or wear.<br />Vendors need to be aware of these details . The dinosaurs are super cute. The dragons are girly looking with pink and for us it was disappointing.\n",

      "31951->They’re Okay for What They Are | 3 | 0 | These Koruser Type II disposable face masks are okay for what they are. They’re as good for my wearing-to-the-grocery-store needs as any.<br /><br />Unlike most versions of this type of mask on the market, these are pure white rather than pale blue. The ear loops are well attached and make donning and doffing simple. The flexible wire nose bridge bends easily to seal on the face, which supposedly minimizes glasses fogging. But exhalation moisture and perspiration still quickly build up inside these three-ply masks (as they do in ALL the masks that I’ve used) and make them uncomfortable after just a short time. The accordion folds adapt them to any facial size and shape.<br /><br />Being compelled to wear a face mask in public is an unpleasant fact of modern life, and the need for them should—but doesn’t—transcend political, cultural and religious differences. Any decent person with the slightest trace of compassion for others, or any sense of personal responsibility, will wear a mask to help control the spread of COVID-19, which continues to surge as I write this because hordes of ignorant, selfish, stupid, oblivious morons can’t even take such a simple, tiny step in the interests of public health.<br /><br />As a commodity and a necessity, at least for those who care more about the greater good than about imagined attacks on their “freedoms,” these masks are okay but nothing special, so I rate them at three stars.\n",

The comb I got was from a solid piece of wood but it did not have much sandalwood aromatic scent as advertised.<br /><br />It if for small hands and heads with a tiny 6-7cm handle (2 1/2&#34;)<br /><br />Be careful! Since they are made from wood, they may break if dropped on a hard floor or subjected to rough handling.<br /><br />Made in China from Hopefully... sustainably harvested sandalwood.<br /><br />I worry about that part since there is no real way to deduce if the raw materials were sustainably harvested.

I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the \"compact pallet holder\" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger\n",

I thought I would use one in the bathroom in the morning, and keep the Speed XL in the car in case I had a night meeting, but now I use the XL driving to work and if necessary after work.<br /><br />In the interim I also tried a Panasonic which was terrible. It is unbelievable how expensive electric shavers have become, and how some brands want an annuity too, with proprietary cleaning cartridges. I don't think my XL was more than $100 and now it's doubled, maybe because it's become exotic over the years.\n",

      "32021->Pretty, long-lasting, subtle color | 4 | 0 | I tend to not wear a lot of eyeshadow, so when I do, I gravitate towards very neutral, but slightly shimmery colors. I was therefore really excited to try this product.<br /><br />The product comes in this adorable little plastic container with a fun image of a cat on it. There is a small mirror on the inside of the lid. I appreciate that the container latches securely, so bits of loose powder don't get all over the place in my makeup bag. I would, however, appreciate if they found a way to fit a tiny applicator somewhere in the underside of the container. I had to dig one out from my makeup drawer.<br /><br />This is an eyeshadow duo with a slightly pinker, and a more taupe-y shade. As you can see from the pic, these colors are very, very subtle on paler skin like mine. However, there is a nice shimmer to them that makes it stand out a bit.  I like that the eyeshadow is pretty clingy and didn't get all over my face when I was applying it. It is long-lasting--at the end of the work day, it still is quite noticeable when I look in the mirror.<br /><br />Currently, the eyeshadow is retailing at about $22. I think this is a bit high, hence the 4 star review, but for makeup fanatics this probably is a good investment. Overall, I'd recommend this product.\n",

      "32052->Works well on natural nails! Not so great on medium or long enhanced nails... | 3 | 0 | I have tried these now 3 times: First on nails with only gel polish, on short polygel nails with gel polish, & on long polygel nails with gel polish. For the natural nails with just gel polish, they worked like a charm! I was so pleased that they actually held the swab with acetone in place firmly without being uncomfortable and worked FAR better than foils.<br /><br />Here's the issue: When I tried them on enhanced nails, the clip caps did not apply pressure evenly to the nails which caused me to have to break out the dreaded foils. I typically have long acrylic or polygel nails, so I'm upset that they didn't work well and aren't longer. Even on the medium length polygels, they still missed more spots than foils do. Will I use them again? Yes, but sadly only for either short enhanced or natural nails.\n",

      "32080->The product has been changed - for the worse | 1 | 0 | This is not the same HeelTastic I've been buying for years. First, it smells different. The new scent is much lighter and, to me, less pleasing than the old scent but not bad. The color is different as well. The new color is white, whereas the old color is more champagne or a pale gold. Coloration could be the age of the older one. They seem to go on the same though. Same viscosity, same melt and spread.<br /><br />The thing that gets me is that the product is only 1-1/5&#34; deep (and 1-5/8&#34; diameter). So much plastic for such little product! The old container is 4&#34; tall; the new one is 3-7/8&#34; tall. Only the height of the lid is different, since the bottoms of the lids align and the containers without lids are the same height. There are some slight packaging differences, and the ingredients list is quite different, though the logo font is the same.<br /><br />In my case it took three weeks to get these. If I'd known all this, I would have just gone down to BB&B (three dollars cheaper) and bought the stuff there. I think I will do that anyway, just to compare them. (My old bottle is almost used up.) Both containers claim to have 2oz of product, but I don't know.<br /><br />In summary: Too much plastic! Very little product! Almost 25 percent more expensive. I do not recommend this product.\n",

      "32100->Disappointed in the Lip Balm | 2 | 0 | For a lip balm called “coconut”, I was expecting it to smell like...well, coconut. It doesn’t. It’s a faintly spicy scent, oddly like nutmeg. Not unpleasant; just not what I was expecting. Not sure why they’re marketing it as coconut. If you’re hoping for a coconut scent, this isn’t the one.<br /><br />I do like the hand cream though. It’s not that thick but provides descent moisture and smells good.\n",
      "32107->Shimmery and pretty | 4 | 0 | These iridescent butterflies add another dimension to my nails. They can also distract or cover up some not so prefect spots. They stuck quite well to the top coat and then I put another top coat over them for security. I found them easier to apply to the wider and flatter nails, my thumbs.<br /><br />This is a nice assortment of colors and types of butterflies. There should be something to match pretty much any color.\n",
      "32116->Easily wipes off. | 3 | 0 | Some reviews say it stays well, that’s not really true. If you wipe your eye at all it’s gone. I’m used to Ulta eye crayons that actually stay on no matter what.<br />I only use a few of the colors and they’re hard to find because the containers don’t show what’s inside. The name of the color is written in that color on the outside but that’s not that helpful.\n",
      "32117->Great For Men's Blends | 5 | 0 | Cajeput Essential Oil (EO) is great in blends for men. My men's milk shaving soap is one of my best sellers at the farmers market.<br /><br />I've been using EO's for well over a decade. I use them in my own skin care products such as lip balms & creams plus my own milk soaps, bathroom sprays, fungal salves, & even blends for treating my farm animals. I never use toxic fragrance oils or perfumes. When I switched to an organic natural lifestyle, my health improved dramatically. I highly recommend essential oils over the toxic man made crapola.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.\n",
      "32140->Beautiful color and great polish - but wish it stayed on longer! | 4 | 0 | I bought this for my son for Christmas. We all love the color - it's holographic just like the back of one of those premium stickers! It changes colors in the light and is just beautiful. It is very low odor too! He said it dried pretty quickly as well.<br />He said it was peeling off after a few days though.<br />He didn't want to use the topcoat - but I bet if he did it would last longer.<br />I was going to try it myself but he wouldn't let me borrow it!\n",
      "32181->Good clay mask | 4 | 0 | I liked this clay mask a lot. The mask cream is very thick indeed, and it takes a squeeze to get it out of the tube. It goes a long way, but at the same time, this is a small tube (3 oz). It dries quickly. And it's the type of mask that makes your face feel TIGHT. The type where you can't smile.<br />After about 20 mins, I washed this off. It was easy to remove. After using a few times, I think it does indeed have a brightening effect on the skin. It doesn't moisturize. At least it didn't for me, and I had to lather on cream afterwards as my skin felt a bit dry after the mask.<br />Overall I liked this. I like how it worked but it is on the pricey side.\n",
      "32184->Good customer service | 4 | 0 | Update: customer service was great and reached out to fix the issue!!<br /><br />This hair gets very very dried out.<br />The tape is not very good. I wear extensions a lot and this is not quality hair.\n",
      "32187->Love the spray, not the seller | 1 | 0 | I’ve been using this brand of hairspray for at least 2 years and I love it. Living in the south, humidity resistance is a must.<br /> I’ve ordered from several different sellers but I won’t buy from this seller anymore.<br />This can of hairspray had a faulty button/spray mechanism and would clog after each use, making it necessary to run it under hot water and work the button for a few minutes before each use. I have never had this problem with the brand before.<br />I reached out to the seller and they told me to put the lid on after every use. Super not helpful as I always put the cap on after use anyway- and I store it in a cabinet so humidity and/or heat or cold are not an issue either.<br />I’ll continue to buy this hairspray but not from a seller that sends a smarta@@ response like that.\n",
      "32219->Good for skin, hair and nails product!!!! | 5 | 0 | Not too oily, light but does what it says.  Love this brand and have shared it with other family members.  Will continue to purchase.<br />Definitely good skin, hair and nails product.\n",
      "32248->Maybe use error, but it's \"just okay.\" | 3 | 0 | Brand new pinstriper here, I picked up this and a scroll brush to try out.<br /><br />I intend to keep practicing with it in case it's just use error for learning a new brush, but I don't like how the paint flows off this sword brush. The natural haired scroll brush I've got seems to have a much smoother flow and even paint lay; I'll have to try a natural bristled sword.<br /><br />Exactly as pictured, decent shipping time.<br /><br />I DO love the short handle and the shape of the brush itself: It gives me great pressure control over line thickness.\n",
      "32249->Very nice moisturizer | 4 | 0 | I like this moisturizer from MD Complete. It comes in a very nice little pump dispenser that allows you to dispense the small quantities you need from this product.<br /><br />The product smells very nicely of citrus and is very lightweight. This moisturizer absorbs quickly into your skin and feels just fantastic. I really feel like it does a fantastic job in the department of moisturizing your skin. Your skin looks and feels fantastic when you use this product, well at least mine does. I have had no negative reactions when I use this moisturizer.<br /><br />It is reasonably priced and works well in my opinion. Personally I can recommend this.\n",
      "32255->Makes your nails healthy! | 5 | 0 | Great polish- helps your nails heal. Needed this for covering mail with fungal infection. Actually helped mail improve!<br />Great stuff- beautiful color!\n",
      "32261->Great Headband but has Shipping Issues - kept arriving broken | 3 | 0 | The seller was nice and re-sent product twice, but both times it arrived broken. At least one of the two I purchased came in tact...the tourtise shell seems to have held up better.  The shape is fantastic for air drying curly hair...my favorite headband for that! But just not enough packing protection to withstand the journey for the black one.<br /><br />They gave me a refund, so the seller is conscientious but I would like them even more if the headband arrived in tact.  I hope they consider better packing materials in the future, it's a great headband shape!\n",
      "32300->Noisy but works | 4 | 0 | When using this in my ears there's a lot of squeaking and clicking and scraping sounds so if that's the sort of thing that bothers you just stick with battery operated trimmers.<br /><br />I wanted this because I was tired of battery operated trimmers breaking down and having to buy a new one all the time especially in this day and age of shortages and not being able to buy replacements so I'm glad I have this but I am going to buy an electronic 1 because I just don't like that clicking scraping screeching noises in my ear.\n",
      "32322->Dont waste your money | 1 | 0 | The bangs are so so as far as the cut. The color is a very different matter. The color is AWFUL!  I ordered honey blond. The color the 3rd party seller calls honey blond is more like the very worst bottle blond. Not only is the color horribly brassy the bangs look like they have been seriously bleached. Very very dry looking. Not<br />Simply put, please dont waste your money\n",
      "32336->Awesome zit cream | 5 | 0 | My daughter told me about this product and how well it works.  She was exaggerating.  It is wonderful.  At<br />my age, I should not have this problem, but I do.  One or two days and my breakout is gone.  Love this.\n",
      "32339->Wonderful eye compress mask! | 5 | 0 | My new ophthalmologist told me to put a hot compress on my eyes for 15 minutes morning and night to open clogged oil glands in my eyelids.<br /><br />Warming a hand towel with hot water felt good - for a minute - so I searched for a better solution and found the Dry Eye Mask by Heyedrate. Since a reviewer tried this mask as well as a more expensive mask and said they are equally good, I bought this one.<br /><br />It’s easy and comfortable to use and stays warm for about 15 minutes. I don’t need to use eye drops as frequently as I used to.<br /><br />On the day I placed my order, my entire right eyelid became red and swollen. The mask arrived the next day, and after I started using it, the swelling in my eyelid immediately decreased, revealing that I also had a stye.<br /><br />Continued use of the mask has helped to speed up the healing of the stye and my right eyelid is nearly back to normal.<br /><br />Highly recommend this eye mask!\n",
      "32342->Ideal for braces... | 4 | 0 | While this is a bit bulky to travel with, the USB charging is very convenient (It's a dedicated dongle however).  The power is not as much as a corded water flosser, but a lot of times you really don't need that much power to get the job done.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this is that our middle schooler, who has braces, can take this along and clear her braces at school or when at a friends house.\n",
      "32350->Great product when it is the correct shade! | 2 | 0 | This is a wonderful product just not<br />My color! My normal shade is dawn ams i received something else.\n",
      "32366->Works great! | 5 | 0 | These HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips work great. My hair is not thick but these clips stay in my hair. I am impressed at how well they work.<br /><br />The pack comes with 4 large clips. The teeth of the clips go inside each other enough to hold the hair. The colors in my box are white, pink, black, and brown.<br /><br />I will be recommending these HH&LL 4pcs Large Hair Claw Clips to family and friends.\n",
      "32373->Its ok.. | 3 | 0 | *UPDATE* I have used the black. You have to do very thin coats in order for it to cure properly. Took 60 sec in an LED. It takes 3 thin coats to be completely opaque.<br />Have not used yet, but it is Very thin and has a tiny cheap brush. Does not look like gel polish. Will update as soon as I have a chance to try it.\n",
      "32377->Works well | 4 | 0 | I don’t think the traveling descriptor is applicable. It’s the size where it can be packed empty, but seems to big for traveling with full container.<br />This is a sprayer that joyfully continues spraying after to release the button, making it great for hair or plants.\n",
      "32402->Good dupe for bright pink | 5 | 0 | For some reason, the same brand's version of bright pink has been expensive lately, so I tried the plum + bubblegum pink. It took a few times to get the right brightness level and it's not an exact match, but I'm happy with the outcome color. It's worth noting though that it took a lot of lightening to get it right. I needed very little plum to create the color.<br /><br />The picture is first week after dying, color only on top of non-treated, non-bleached hair. The difference between back and front is a function of color depositing on grey, an effect I like because it gives some variation and highlighting effects. For reference, my natural shade is auburn that's gone mousy and grey in old age.\n",
      "32427->light, floral lavender | 5 | 0 | Lavender is my #1 go-to essential oil. I think I use it in 90% of my blends, whether in the diffuser or in topical blends (or sprays, etc). The only thing I definitely don’t use it for is my home-made cleaning products where citrus oils are the only essential oils.<br /><br />This particular oil is a very delicate scent – some lavender oils can pack quite a punch in terms of the scent. This is certainly floral and has a ‘high note’ to it. You can easily pick it out of a blend. It’s my first oil from New York Biology and I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I love blending lavender in particular with chamomile, as it has an almost instantaneous calming effect. Also love to blend it with bergamot, ylang ylang, mandarin, and a drop of lime.<br /><br />The bottle is very large, a dark brown color to protect the oil from UV rays which can damage the oils and decrease the shelf life. My favorite way to dispense oils is with the eye dropper (the euro droppers found in smaller bottles tend to gush several drops at once, so that’s definitely not my preference) – you can really control how many drops you dispense with these eye droppers.<br /><br />Arrived well protected in bubble wrap and there was no leaks.<br /><br />* I received the oil for evaluation and review\n",

Enhanced Organic Ingredients with Vitamin E<br />Pros:<br />I have tried a couple wrinkle serums. The one is a little thicker than some, but I like it as it doesn't run on your skin then. It's seems quite gentle as I use it daily. There are no side effect that I can see. I've only been using it for under 2 wks and will update this post if I see any good/bad changes.  The bottle is nice sold and it comes with an eye dropper to make applying easier.<br />Cons:<br />I would prefer a pump or just dabbing it on.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I like how my skin feels so far, again will update along the way. I will purchase this again.<br />I received this Baebody Retinol Serum 2.5%: Best Anti Wrinkle for a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide unbiased honest feedback regarding the product, whether it be positive or negative.\n",
      "32484->quantity but not quality | 3 | 0 | pros: I like that so many bottles come in a pack and that it includes a funnel for easy transfer of your rubbing alcohol/ hand sanitizer spray into the travel bottles.<br /><br />cons: However, they only work less than 50 percent of the time. Like when you spray, liquid does not come out with every spray. It is frustrating to attempt to spray the bottle when nothing comes out. Also, the lids don't have a secure fit\n",
      "32490->Very nice shampoo that works and smells lovely | 4 | 0 | This is a pretty nice shampoo. You get a massive bottle of this shampoo that comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser on the top, which personally I prefer since it makes it so much easier to use in the shower especially. The shampoo itself smells very nice, which is a big plus in my eyes.<br /><br />It lathers up very nice and cleanses your with ease. Once you are done the shampoo rinses out quite quickly without any issues. The hair feels nice and clean and I for one am quite happy. This is a pretty good deal and I for one am happy with this.\n",
      "32496->Buyer beware!! | 1 | 0 | So these are a bit thicker but you definitely need more than one for it to look like real hair.<br />Also this is not 16 inches! I compared it to my other 16inch extensions and these are way shorter!\n",
      "32502->Does not burn and smaells tastes good | 4 | 0 | This mouthwash does not burn, even after flossing.  It lingers with protection for several hours. Although not 12 hours that is refered to by Colgate.<br /> I have not had any black stains after 3 weeks use.  I only use it one time a day though.<br />This is an okay product, just as good as any colgate I've used, but I can't say I notice a huge improvement over the regular total mouthwash.\n",
      "32522->Don't waste your money! | 1 | 0 | The humidity was causing my salt to clump up so that it didn't flow at all, so I ordered this set based upon the reviews. What a disappointment!<br /><br />I used one of these for my Himalayan pink salt, and the other for popcorn salt.  Within a day or two both of them were caked up and useless.<br /><br />Unfortunately I missed the return date for this junk.  Keep looking for another product - this one in worthless.\n",

But I completely forgot about brand new dark fabric tends to bleed and stain when wet. My head was getting sweaty as I slept and some days I braid my hair damp with product and put the cap on letting it dry over night and woke ho to my light beige pillow case stained with the dye.<br />I took the new bonnet and washed it with dawn soap and the water turned deep bluish black.<br />I should have known better but I just forgot. I didn’t even have these pillow cases for that lont and i love them 😖<br /><br />update: I’ve washed this thing so many times and still the dye bleeds and leaves stains. I have never had a piece of fabric do this after so many washes. it’s frustrating seeing these dye transfers on my linens!\n",

The smell is so bad, I don't know how anyone could get past it. It's also very watery and mine separated weirdly.<br /><br />The product smelled terrible. The company said they were sending a new one out and never did.\n",
      "32589->These things are pretty cool. I like being able to wrap my ... | 4 | 0 | These things are pretty cool. I like being able to wrap my hair in the towel to and let it dry. I have super thick hair and they're right, it doesn't take very long.<br /><br />The texture isn't awful after you wash it, which is a huge deal for me when it comes to towels. It is good quality and made well. I only wish it were a tad bit bigger because I have a lot of hair!\n",
      "32596->... from Smooth N Clear How can this actually be fun? Well | 5 | 0 | Callus Remover from Smooth N Clear<br />  How can this actually be fun?  Well, not fun-fun, but interesting.  I can't believe how much dead skin comes off while you are &#34;sanding&#34; your feet!  It is amazing!<br />  No amount of foot scrubs or using the little egg with blades could do better.  This Callus Remover is so easy to use.  When I am finished using this remover, I admire & touch my feet - then I put lotion or vaseline on & then some white socks.  I wear the socks overnight.  In the morning, my feet are so soft & free of dead skin & any beginnings of calluses.  Easy!  I don't use the remover every night, just maybe once or twice a week.  Maybe, skip a week.  So it doesn't feel like just another chore.<br />  This Callus Remover comes nicely packaged & you get a cleaning brush & 2 rollers.  I just wish I knew where I could get some extra rollers.  I feel the machine itself might outlast the 2 rollers.  If I find some rollers that fit - I'll update my review.<br />  I did receive my remover for a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  Thank You!!\n",

Opened this 2nd bottle to use today but noticed that its formula is different or has changed, product doesn’t expire until next year. I shook the bottle to see if it would mix, but it didn’t. Looks like mucus. Disgusting.<br />Can I please exchange for a new one?\n",

      "32638->Ouch! | 1 | 0 | I decided to buy this to try to make my already curly hair more uniform in appearance.  My hair is very long and it spirals to begin with. Silly me thought I could make it all the spirals look exactly the same.<br />I started out with perfectly washed and combed hair.  Took me a few minutes to figure out that you can add extensions to the evil wand.  I was trying to shove just the end portion through a cork screw curler, didn't work that great.<br />My one daughter,  also with curly hair, was intrigued and asked what I was doing.  I told her I was trying to be pretty!<br />First chunk of hair, ok, wow, that was painful! I tried not to let her see the tears in my eyes. 2nd chunk, ouch! 3rd chunk I was about ready to full blown cry! I told myself to be brave,  there was no turning back.  Chuck after chunk I literally felt my scalp screaming in agony! My daughter begged me to stop but I continued to recite, mommy will be so pretty!<br />I finished and noticed my face was bright red from holding my breath. I tried to relax and do homeschool with my kids but they kept cracking up laughing at me. The entire time I can feel throbbing in my scalp like a high-school band practice.<br />I couldn't take it anymore,  they needed to come out. Wait, you pull them?? I slowly tried one by one and had to start holding onto my roots for fear I'd look like a middle aged bald man when my husband comes home from work. They were holding onto those curves for dear life! Yep, so kudos to you if you have hair of steal that can survive these curlers. I feel so jaded for thinking this was a clever concept.\n",

GROSS! Imagine that all over your kids body? Just on my hands from the application it was gross.<br />Sun protection was NOT there. I applied to my daughter 30 + mins before she got in the pool. Less than 30 min play time she was already so red!<br />Plus... super slimy once wet. This one is a no go\n",

As of right now I have been using a lavender oil in this diffuser. Whenever I’m stress, I go to my office, turn in this diffuser, and meditate. It has helped a lot.<br />I took a star off because I have to be sitting right next to it in order to smell any sent that I put in it.

In my opinion, if you cannot afford your own domain for your email, how about the chemical analysis of the product? Where was the number of 899,999 IU taken from?<br />The consistency, color and feel looks almost the same to me as the Good 'N Natural retinol cream. I gave it two stars because it leaves a matte appearance to skin instead of shiny and greasy, and it does moisturizes. As far as the effect on skin from Retinol, I cannot attest to anything since I threw it away after two uses. I don't want to use a product that looks like it was made and packaged from a garage.\n",

But if you have some grace and patience, these might be perfect.\n",

Seems cheaply made otherwise which I expected for the price and doesn't bother me.<br />Over two weeks out on my balcony to air out and have exposure to sun. Smell is still just too much to deal with. $10 down the drain. Will shop for one where I can smell them first\n",

It might be good for other people, but the long curved handle actually made it more unwieldy to reach every part of my back. But the part that really made me dock stars is that, somehow the way the bristles (which are soft) rub on the plastic nubs (maybe they aren't finished smoothly?) left red scratch marks on my back and arms! I'm not cool with that. I gave 1 extra star because it seems to be constructed well, in comparison to the other two brushes I have used. However, this is the only one that actually left red scratch marks on me.<br /><br />edit: Although the product did not work out well for me, the customer service was very outstanding and pleasant to work with. They contacted me and offered me a refund.

This oil is also Frangrance Free.<br />These 5 Oils included in the serum are : Argan Oil , Jojoba Oil , Triticum Borage Oil,  and Sesamum Indicum Oil.<br /> The directions say to drop a few drops and  rub in the palm of your hand and then on face and neck at night. However, I put it on other parts of my skin. It goes on a little oily but absorbs in really well.  It is an anti aging serum so I think I will continue to put it on my face and tops of my hands . ;) A few drops go a long way so this bottle should last for a while. I love products that are all Natural or Organic. I think it is smart to put less Chemicals on and in your body as much as possible.<br /><br />The serum is not too thin but it isn't  thick either. It really only takes a few drops to go a long way. The serum is a fresh honey-yellow color.<br /><br />*Glass Amber bottle with Protective cap<br />*Glass dropper<br />*1.69 ounces / 50 ml<br /><br />  I recommend  this product very much.

Keep in mind, when you use products containing retinol, your skin is more sensitive to sun light so make sure to use sun protection when you go outside.<br /><br />This serum smells amazing and I for one really like that a lot about this product. The serum itself is almost like a cream and very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves hardly any residue behind, and what it does pretty much disappears quickly. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive at $30 so for me this one is a winner.\n",
      "32758->Refreshing lemon | 4 | 0 | These are wonderful for freshening up face and hands. On the box, it's suggests that you can wipe down surfaces. They aren't antibacterial, and they don't clean, but they will leave a nice refreshing scent. On many surfaces, they will leave streaks, as well as not really cleaning.<br />I suggest using them mainly as a quick way to clean your hands on the go without alcohol or chemicals that you might not want on your skin.\n",
      "32771->lower than expected | 3 | 0 | This UV lamp can be described in three aspects. Price, power and quality. I used it three times so far for different gels like Poly gel, gel polish and builder gel and it worked for all of them. Compare to other same product the price is so reasonable for a couple of reasons. First, the power is so high because I used to keep my fingers under UV for 2 minuets with other LED lams but this one just needs 90 seconds. The longer you keep your fingers under UV the more your skin get darker and also is not good for your health. The main purpose that I got this UV lamp was my pregnancy which I really did not want to go to the salons because I think the smell of so many chemicals in the salons is not good for my baby health. The quality of the lamp is not so good. Once it fell off on the carpet and it became a little bit loos however it is still working.<br />To put everything in a nutshell it is a good purchase if you are not a nail artist and you do not want to use it in your profession.<br />Pros:<br />1. High power<br />2. Good price<br />Cons:<br />1. Low body quality\n",
      "32777->Beautiful Upgrade for DIY from Polluting Plastic Bottles | 5 | 0 | This is the second set of spray bottles of this type that I have ordered. Each set has been from a different brand/seller. They both perform exactly the same. I use them to make my own household cleaners, room sprays, toilet sprays, etc. I'm not a fan of our cultures plastic addiction & try to reduce my impact on the planet when I can. Running my own eco family farm full time helps considerably ;)<br /><br />I like everything about these bottles except for the same exact thing I don't like about my other set of bottles, the spray head rotates easily. It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say. I currently don't have a need to order a bunch of bottles in this size & enjoy the convenience of having a ready made kit of 2, so for now, I'm happy enough with what I have.\n",

They were gone within a couple of days.<br />Which, for a parent isn't a bad thing. I've had my kid put on a tattoo and it's lasted over a week.<br />The animals/cards are not all matching, and I was pretty surprised by some of the cards that look very cartoonish and some are more realistic looking.<br />There are 40 cards in total. I have included a picture of all the cards. And then a closer of four of the sets (jungle animals, marine animals, circus and insects). Hopefully that is helpful.\n",
      "32832->Unique | 4 | 0 | REVIEWING: Ombre Wigs Short Bob Wigs 2 in 1 Curly Wig + Straight Wig Ombre Red Blonde Bob Wig for Women Synthetic Cosplay Daily Wigs(12\", Rust Red Blonde)<br />*<br />*<br />This is a very unique wig. I believe it's best for costume/cosplay or every once in awhile. A week or 2 at best. I can see it being everyday for some with basic styling, hats/accessories, just not for me.<br /><br />Ya gotta finesse a bit to get styles because the wefts will show & even the cap along the edges--Especially the temples (by the ears). Honestly, I feel the wig is a bit on the small side if you can't get your hair super flat. I couldn't get the wig pulled forward all the way wearing my hair how I normally do under wigs. I can usually grab any wig & it fits, so one that fits awkwardly for me I know is a caution for others who have to choose more carefully.<br /><br />It's about average thickness of decent synthetic wigs. The fluffiness on the bottom makes it seem thicker. It's more 'full' than thick. There's a lot of wefts constructed closely together, so everything is concealed well enough.<br /><br />It does shed a bit as does every blonde synthetic wig I've ever had. It's not necessarily excessive, but I get a bit of shedding everytime I comb it.<br /><br />The part is done decently & can be blended to match your natural scalp.<br /><br />I don't care for the style right out the bag. Although I love the waves, the curl curls too hard for my taste. I don't like the way the back looks at all. I did a quick straighten with my blow dryer, so it can def be done with heat (the photo with my hand in the neck of my shirt).<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty decent synthetic wig. I love the color, but wasn't impressed by the finish on the perimeter & the 2 torn loops at the back for adjusting (I now have to wear it at the tightest adjustment. I can repair by sewing but could be an inconvenience for some). Also, I feel it's kind of below the average size for a wig.<br /><br />With that I'd say it's a bit steep, but maybe makes up for it in uniqueness & style opportunities . . . if you know how.\n",

      "32865->Cloyingly sweet non-pineapple fragrance, and the quality of the products felt cheap. | 2 | 0 | I really wanted to like this product, and I love pineapple, so I was super excited when it arrived. Unfortunately, I was let down by the quality of the actual products. They make a cute gift set, but that's really all they have going for them.<br /><br />I love the smell of pineapple, but I found the scent of these products to be unpleasant. They smell very cloyingly sweet and artificial, and not much like pineapple at all. The whipped body soap had a nice texture, but it left my skin dry, and it took a lot of product just to get clean. The body butter felt sticky and greasy, and not all that luxurious. My skin was left a bit tacky, and not very moisturized even after it was absorbed. The bath soak is alright, but it has the same unfortunate scent as the other products, and you really don't get much product, so it's more appropriate for foot soak than a bath. The body scrub was probably the best product out of the bunch, and it creates a nice lather when mixed with water. It left my skin soft, but unfortunately was also quite drying.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this product. The presentation of the product is adorable, and I love that it's vegan... but the quality of this skincare product set just isn't very good.\n",

      "32886->These Masks Leave My Hair So Smooth and Shiny! 👩🏼 | 5 | 0 | I’ve used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it’s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!\n",
      "32916->Roller barely rotates, you'd basically get same effect by keeping some metal spoons in your freezer | 1 | 0 | If this device had a motor in the handle that caused the cold head to rotate, there'd be more to talk about here, but frankly this is just two metal discs you can put in your freezer with cheaply made plastic attachment pieces to stick on a small cheap handle. It doesn't rotate on its own, you have to do that for it, and when you try to, the poor connection between the cold metal heads and their plastic bases and the handles doesn't even produce consistent spins the way it's supposed to.<br /><br />You'd honestly be better served by just keeping two metal spoons in your freezer and using them the same way: put it on your skin and move it in a circular motion. If you find it's slightly too cold, wrap a paper towel square around the spoon head and rubber band it in place. Same effect.<br /><br />***Overall Value***<br /><br />This is a pretty blatant cash grab that offers little no nothing for what you're paying. If there was a motor in the handle to rotate the head, that would be one thing, but this is akin to selling a normal toothbrush and asking for 3 times as much many saying it's like an electric toothbrush because you can move it in a circular motion with your wrist and make your own humming sound.<br /><br />Save your money, go put some spoons in your freezer. Apply to face as needed.\n",
      "32920->Spatulas are excellent for applying creams, mask products, etc.; brush pads good for face washing | 5 | 0 | I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc.  This set includes three colorful and double-side spatulas/scrubbers. Also included are two thin purple silicone pads with finger holders that are great for washing my face.<br /><br />Each double-sided wand has a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end and another side with larger soft nubs. The nubby side is good for cleaning or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.<br /><br />The \"egg-shaped\" purple pads are great for scrubbing my face with soap and lathering up. I love the nub that allows me to hold on to this.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent set. These are soft on my skin, pliable, and easy to hold on to. I do wish the wands were just a few inches longer for a better grip. The current price of $13.29 ($13.99 minus 5%) is competitively priced for this set as it comes to $2.66 per item.\n",

      "32982->A generous, potent bottle of lavender essential oil. | 4 | 0 | This is my first foray into essential oils and I'm liking it a lot. I'm using the oil in two ways: for aroma and, in theory, for its physiological properties. I like diffusers a lot but am too cheap and suspicious of additives to buy them often. I've been using this lavender oil along with some safflower oil and rubbing alcohol in my bedroom and it adds a nice, luxurious touch to bedtime. I've sprinkled a bit on my body pillow, too, when I feel like I want a much stronger dose of the relaxation.<br /><br />I read somewhere that mixing it with a carrier oil (I'm using rosehip oil) and rubbing it on the bottom of your feet can help with insomnia, so I've been doing that. I don't know if it's working, but it is making my feet feel softer, so that's something. I haven't experienced any respiratory or skin irritation with this product.<br /><br />The bottle is a dark brown color so that the light can't get to the oil and break it down. They sent a dropper along with the oil, which I appreciated since I didn't have others. Next I'm going to try to make some kind of reusable sachet for my drawers--I just need to figure out what scent to mix it with first.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am always conscious and aware of the number of items and possessions I bring into my home and try to make mindful decisions, because The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up told me to. For this reason, I only accept items that I feel will serve me, my family, and my needs. I do not accept items that seem useless or that do not speak to me. If I post a positive review it is because I had a positive experience. If I have only positive experiences, I chalk that up to a successful exercise in mindful purchasing and decision-making. If I have a negative experience, as with any Amazon product, I reach out to the seller or manufacturer and seek assistance or replacement before deciding on a rating.\n",
      "32994->Comparing to Conair's oil warmer | 3 | 0 | I got this product not only because it came with an additional bottle for roughly the same price as the others, but the comparation of Conair's oil warmer. They say this one is better be because of numerous things, but one that caught my eye was the leaking.<br /><br />It is true that Conair's leaks when left on, it can heat up the oil inside much better than these type of product, for half the price; albeit you can only get one oil in there.<br /><br />Anyway, Conair's dispenses and keeps my oil at over 95 F, while this one only heats up the oil to about 85F, 90 F max; even then it requires alot of time to get there. Moreover, it can't seem to reach the oil in the dispenser, so you have to dispense multiple times to get to the warm oil. That claim to keep your oil at 140F is only the metal walls that heats up the bottle. But the heat transfer to the oil is very bad.<br /><br />This product, and ones like it, is not as good as the one that is half the price. Although, if you don't want hot oil then I guess this one is good for you. It does come with an extra bottle.\n",
      "32995->These work well | 4 | 0 | These underarm sweat pads are just the thing for that extra protection in times of need! Sometimes no matter how much or what kind of deodorant you use, you just can't seem to stop the unsightly and ever so embarrassing pit stain of doom.  With these placed in your shirt the sweat never reaches your shirt and your garments are saved!<br />These work very well. To use them you simply lay your shirt down flat, remove the covering over the adhesive, place firmly in the spot needed, and you are good to go. When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.\n",
      "33031->Impressively easy to use and looks great | 5 | 0 | This kit is fantastic. It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.\n",

Easy to clean and wipe down after every guest.  The material seems like it will last a very long time!<br /><br />CONS:<br />The cushion has a tendency to fall off as my guests get up from the shampoo bowl, which is super annoying to have happen.<br />Also... the product has a horrible smell to it... almost so much that I was close to returning it.<br />It’s a chemical/rubber like smell which I seem to have fixed after cleaning it and wiping it down.  But beware when it comes out of the packaging.\n",
      "33037->The idea is great… but I couldn’t make them work | 2 | 0 | Positive: the idea is fantastic! I wish I was able to make them work. They do magnetize as described but work best with mascara already on your lashes.<br /><br />Negative: Super bummed. I really wanted these things to work. Maybe someone with more lash experience could get them to work but my daughter (16) and I couldn’t get them to work as described. The lashes wouldn’t line up properly on either side, regardless us trying to change things up. You can also feel the weight of the magnets on your lids, which felt rather heavily. Honestly I would’ve tolerated the weight of the magnets if I could’ve gotten the magnets to line up correctly.<br /><br />Deets: there are 2 lashes you magnetize together. One side goes on top of the lash, the other magnetizes on the opposite side. The goal is to get the lashes lined up on your natural eye lashes. When they are on, they look good. My problem was I couldn’t wear them without mascara. The other problem is the magnets would magnetize but the lashes that were supposed to connect wouldn’t magnetize properly, making the lashes look awkward. Basically one lash was off compared to the one it was supposed to match up with. We even tried the 2nd pair included in the kit, thinking maybe it was just that set but unfortunately the 2nd pair did the same thing. Darn. We returned them and ordered magnetizing eye lashes that connect to eye liner. I guess we’ll see if those work better.\n",

      "33100->Decent wig, very fine strands. | 3 | 0 | Due to the costs, one cannot expect to get a high quality human hair wig. Rather, with the proper expectations, this is a decent, synthetic strand, wig. In fact, the strands look like very fine, real hair. I would say that it is very similar to Chinese hair, which is fine, and very straight.<br />Being 14\" long, you have the choice of leaving it at the current shoulder length, or styling and cutting it. I like that aspect, making it more versatile.  This niche product works well for halloween, costume party, dung disguise event, as stated in the product description.<br />Overall, it's an inexpensive option for a decent wig. It's not really meant to fool anyone into thinking it's your real hair, nor to be a full, robust hairpiece. As such, it fulfills it's expectations and purpose. I'd rate this 3.5 stars.\n",

The combination gave me a great BSS while on the road, but I am not a fan of the scent. It reminds me of that old bathroom soap that ground the soap cake into your palm like parmesan cheese, the smell, that is. Have to say that I don't care for it. Also, when you open the stick, you will have no choice but to either loosely wrap it back up after use, or, as I do, store the open stick in a plastic bag. A better option would be a plastic tube with a cap. Naturally, that would affect the price negatively. These days there are many travel shaving soap options, so while Arko will give you a smooth shave, if the scent isn't your thing, you can easily find something else.<br />Recommended for its shaving qualities, NOT for the scent.\n",

      "33283->If you value your long hair, skip it. | 1 | 0 | Holy cow was this hard to use on long hair.<br /><br />I had long hair that was down to my waist, but when curled, was about the length to my chest. This product was by far the MOST difficult to use because no matter how I sectioned the hair, it ALWAYS managed to get stuck or tangled in either the silicone or stick, while pulling the hair through the tube.<br /><br />In the end, there also wasn't enough tubes to curl my whole head. I also ripped, tangled hair, and on top of that, when I assembled the blue stick (originally in 2 pieces), I was unable to detach it for traveling (?????). I ended up breaking it in order to detach it. Not to mention that some of the tubes also had bits of silicone (on the edges of the tube, to prevent slipping, I assume) that were already ripped. This was HORRIBLE because it would also contribute to the ripping and tangling of my hair.<br /><br />This was just a whole nightmare to use. I would skip out on this product.\n",
      "33293->Very moisturizing, but not greasy! | 5 | 0 | This 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product. They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.\n",
      "33310->Nice scent | 5 | 0 | Okay, it is a salt scrub. They all pretty much work the same.  Use in the shower, salt dissolves when the water hits it making it easy to clean up compared to other non-salt scrubs.  A bit of oil to moisturize your skin leaving it soft after.<br /><br />I did love the smell of this one.  It is a little strong, so if you have allergies, you may want to skip it.  Some fragrances do bother me, but this one didn't.  It was a fresh floral scent\n",
      "33316->Beautiful gift, relaxing tool | 5 | 0 | I absolutely loved the rose quartz roller! It feels very gentle on your face and your neck, and the cold of the stone is soothing and reduces inflammation. I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some conflicting information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the bottom part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll downward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a great massaging, relaxing, and skin care tool that looks beautiful.<br /><br />As for the little bottle of tumbled rose quartz chips? No idea. Decorative?\n",
      "33339->AWESOME | 5 | 0 | I wish  i had gotten these ages ago. perfect for putting on foundation and dabbing it all over to look flawless<br />highly recommend !\n",
      "33347->As Beverly would say ; | 5 | 0 | Excellent product . Retains it's aroma for a minimum of 24 hours .<br />As Beverly would say , &#34; no regrets ; no complaints &#34;.\n",
      "33357->Won't fit my ears | 1 | 0 | The posts are too wide to fit through my pierced earlobes.  They are about twice as wide as any of my other earring posts.<br /><br />They're beautiful, but unless you have slightly stretched lobes, don't purchase.\n",
      "33365->Fantastic sleeping mask that delivers results | 5 | 0 | This is a lovely sleeping mask that comes in a stunning looking jar. As the name implies it is applied at night so it can do its magic. Inside this jar is a creamy mask that smells amazing and I for one really like this. The mask is on the medium weight side but still absorbs pretty quickly into the skin which is great.<br /><br />The skin definitely feels a bit sticky when you apply this mask to your skin but this is common with sleeping masks. I have a couple who don't but this one does and it is not a big deal since you apply it before you head to bed. The next morning you will love the results. The skin feels soft, smooth and looks radiant. I for one am a fan and happy with the results I can get.\n",
      "33410->Extremely strong scent. | 3 | 0 | My husband tried this as he was looking for a new deodorant for when out on his mountain bike and for going to the gym.  The first and most obvious thing upon opening the mailer-envelope is the strong scent.  After opening the deodorant and putting it on, my husband put it on for a 2 hour ride.  Obviously he wasn't smelling the perfume in the deodorant while he was riding as the wind was moving it away from his face.  However, when he finally got home, both he and I could still smell it on him.  It was still quite strong.<br /><br />Overall the product seems to stem the sweat from his underarms where he put it, but the strong scent of perfume (especially at the gym) made him self conscious for other reasons.  While he was not stinky, he was definitely smelly.<br /><br />Overall this seems to be the way that most deodorants are going.  So the only solution is to use unscented deodorant.<br /><br />Recommended only if you like or don;t mind strong perfume.  A fully functional deodorant.\n",
      "33413->THESE WORK FAST AND ARE GREAT FOR TRAVELING! | 4 | 0 | These Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads work great, they're fast at taking off heavy polish and are perfect for traveling by plane.<br />  Each single packet containd a thick moist pad that did all ten of my fingers in no time which I appreciate. These do have a smell but it's to be expected with any strong polish remover.<br />  There are only 10 packets in the box so as far as price goes, these are costly for regular use but if you have a trip planned or you regularly travel these are perfect.\n",
      "33415->Appropriately Sized Bottles for Travel | 5 | 0 | I don’t like to travel with the original bottles of shampoo, body wash, etc.  They are huge and would take up my whole suitcase.  This set of 6 bottles are great for holding just enough to last the trip.  There are three 100 cc (the maximum amount per bottle for carry-on) spray bottles.  Also, there are three 60 cc pump bottles.  Each is made of hard plastic and 5.5 inches tall.  They fit very well into a purse or cosmetic bag.<br /><br />I put shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand sanitizer in them.  They are clear, so TSA shouldn’t have a problem with it when screening at the airport.  The pump and spray are easy to operate.  One word of caution on the pumps:  The pump attachment does not lock, so I recommend saving the little clip that came with the bottle to keep the pump in a locked position.  In summary, these are good quality pumps and spray bottles for a great price.\n",
      "33422->These WILL hold on! | 4 | 0 | I've been experimenting with glue-free and magnetic-free lashes and I really enjoyed using this product! Is it my absolute favorite? At the time of writing this review, so far, yes!<br /><br />I really like the formula of the eyeliner, it has been one of the smoothest I have tried so far. As for the strength of the adhesiveness of the eyeliner with the lashes, it is super strong! Even the slightest touch of the lash to the eyeliner will have it STUCK! The eyeliner also is very water and smudge proof!<br /><br />I have only taken one star off because the lash band itself can be a little bit irritating for people with small eyelids/monolids. While wearing these lashes, the inner corner of my eyes were feeling a bit irritated because the band was poking the skin. Eventually this made my eye water, and the inner corners of the eyelash were beginning to peel up. I feel that if I readjusted these lashes, or cut some portion off, it would help with the issue.\n",
      "33431->Decent product | 4 | 0 | I bought this item in hopes of having natural looking beach waves without having to use heat. I have long pin-straight hair. I had almost enough rollers to use on all of my hair (1-2 more rollers would’ve been perfect). I used the roller as instructed to with partially damp here. I felt like it made my hair slightly staticky which isn’t the norm for me. It definitely gave me curls but I wouldn’t call them natural looking beach curls.<br /><br />The seller/customer service is GREAT! I was responded to quickly when I contacted them about using this item. Overall it’s a decent purchase. If you’re looking for beach waves I wouldn’t recommend this item but if you’re looking for curls that are made without using heat, I’d say give this item a try.\n",
      "33436->Soft hair! Good color match. | 4 | 0 | I really like that this is such a good color match to my own hair and that it’s so soft… I just have to figure out how to get it to look more realistic and blended. So far it just doesn’t look good on me. You can see where my hair ends and this piece starts. I think I’d have more luck with someone else helping me style it, I just don’t have anyone at the moment. Overall this seems to be a high quality hair piece. Great option for those of us with thinner hair. I’m really glad to have the option.<br /><br />Update: for now, I’m just using a wide headband to cover the spot I’m uncomfortable with.\n",
      "33444->Great for travel! | 4 | 0 | I got this for my daughter who has braces.  She has a much larger water flosser and thought this one would be easier to use and take up less space.  She didn't like it at all, so I've been using it.  This one does take up very little space making it convenient to store or to travel with.  It is easy to use, and does a good job cleaning my teeth.  However, the unit itself is very hard to clean and the tank is a little too small to really do a thorough job, so you have to refill it mid use.<br /><br />The unit is cordless which is nice and comes with multiple heads.  It is easy to re-charge and holds a charge for approximately one week. Overall, I think this is a great oral irrigator for travel but for everyday home use, I would recommend something with a bigger tank that is easier to clean.\n",
      "33454->Wax On, Wax Off, Hair Still There | 1 | 0 | I think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It’s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It’s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn’t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn’t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by –> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that’s always worked. Tough “chin” hairs –> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn’t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable “cups”.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180°(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn’t hurt, sting, or cause redness – then again …<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn’t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax – tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn’t get these again.\n",
      "33485->it's more of a spinner than a shaker. | 5 | 0 | [[VIDEOID:2a3b24d571a05f44cc8ace5cc8909f81]] Hotep brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review of the spinner or shaker, good this is a good thing for mixing if you're a maker. I like the fact that they come with interchangeable sizes to use your spin. If you can't put in from the bottom you can put at the top my friend.<br /><br />I recommend my friend.

I brought to use in between salon visit since  I travel a lot . But it’s been a couple of weeks and still haven’t receive my products<br />No seller information to contact about order or refund or tell me to contact Amazon .

      "33501->It turns your hair purple | 2 | 0 | This shampoo turns your hair purple<br />and won’t wash out.  We have used other purple shampoo and it didn’t do that and the purple washed out.  My grand daughter stopped using it<br />and it trying to get her hair back to her blond\n",
      "33513->Sadly just an average product that doesn't do much for hair loss and hair growth | 3 | 0 | This shampoo by Mr. Zaranda was just average in my eyes. I had higher hopes for it but it is what it is. It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.<br /><br />Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.\n",
      "33533->Difficult to match hair color and style | 3 | 0 | The order comes with one (1) hair buns scrunchii. I ordered the strawberry blonde color and also ended up ordering another color, brown black. The strawberry blonde color is more of a brown color with a hint of red shades. I feel it's difficult to match color on this. The brown black is closer to the natural black color, especially if your hair is sunkissed.<br /><br />The hair is soft to the touch. The hair is bunched up around the scrunchii. You can loop and tie it around your hair to add volume to your hair. The hair is a bit curled so again, it can be a little bit difficult to match the hair style if your hair is not normally curly or you've styled it curly.\n",
      "33536->Deluxe Set with Smaller Travel Version | 5 | 0 | I've seen so many of these jade roller/rose quartz sets and they all look the same except for the prices. This one is a good set to give as a gift because it's larger and nicer than some of the more chintzy sets. It comes with not only the usual rose quartz roller with the questionably useful Gua Sha stone (personally I found it useless for skin issues but they nevertheless include it in all these sets) but a small roller, which you almost never see anywhere. It's the perfect size for travelling and works just as well as the larger version.<br /><br />However, the larger roller has spikes on one end, which I don't like at all and which they had kept the usual smooth end. It seems made for microdermabrasion which is painful to use and which I don't believe works at all for beautifying your face, only hurting it. Except for this, I like this set.\n",

      "33599->So Disappointing, Don't Buy :( | 2 | 0 | The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the designs are cute. However, I highly recommend not buying this stamping plate. This isn't etched metal, it's a cheap acrylic and so the pick up of the designs are shaky and way too thick to recognize the design half of the time.<br /><br />If I had known this was plastic (woe is the person who doesn't read reviews), I wouldn't have purchased it. So sad the designs don't pick up the way they look on the plate because of this.\n",
      "33604->These suck | 1 | 0 | I’ve used a similar product Vanity Table and was hoping these would be close to the same quality.  I spent like a hour fitting and hardening them with a UV light to just have them cure so hard but not stick to my actual nails that they immediately popped right off, almost like press on nails without the glue. Yes I prepped my nails correctly with alcohol wipes and filing off the oil on my nail beds.<br />Very disappointed, I’d give zero stars if I could\n",
      "33609->SUPERB FACIAL SERUM | 5 | 0 | The science behind facial skincare has made many discoveries over the last decade and in turn the best skincare products have evolved to take advantage of those findings.<br /><br />This Sunrise Serum by Merlot  is a perfect example of one of these products. Collagen is key to healthy, youthful looking skin - certain ingredients have been found to promote collagen production. This product incorporates the best ingredients known to increase collagen in facial tissue.<br /><br />In addition this Sunrise Serum has lightening agents that work together to smooth and even skin tone.  I was especially interested in this aspect as I have a few sunspots that I want to lighten.  Over the several weeks of using this twice a day I can see that it is gradually lightening them. Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I’m seeking, but based on my initial findings I’m confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend. I look forward to using more Merlot products in the future as I found this serum superb.\n",
      "33638->It's nice | 3 | 0 | I bought this because I thought it would be more pink, more opaque, more.. Cream.<br />It's a bit drying, and the color is kind of coral-pink, kind of like salmon. Maybe it's just how I see it.<br /><br />It's nice, but I don't ADORE it.\n",

My wife and daughter both get small bouts of acne during the month<br />and they’ve both benefited from this kit in diminishing breakouts and gently keeping their skin<br />clean and moisturized. They both want to continue using it and see if the soft gels make a<br />difference, but until then they are very happy with this kit. Four stars\n",

Of course I need help reaching where it hurts the most.<br />Not too bad in places I can reach.<br />Worth the money?? Ehh, for me, not really. But I also have other devices and a husband to calm my muscle tension.<br />It’s great in a pinch while I’m at work.\n",
      "33657->No noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14 | 3 | 0 | NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.\n",

I don't have a lot but the ones I have are enough to get me very concerned about what skin care products to use. One other thing that I am concerned about is my sensitive skin. I love the Retinol Night Cream by Key West Health and Beauty because it addresses all my concern: help with moisture retention on my face, eradicating what fine lines I have on my face and a formula that will work with my extra sensitive skin.

      "33869->Not Waterproof!!! | 2 | 0 | I bought this mirror for my husband to use for shaving in the shower because it said it was water proof. Ill give it credit for the name which is accurate in that the lights were in fact very bright, however they did not disperse the light very well/widely so you went blind from looking at the mirror. The &#34;fogless&#34; portion of this items title does NOT fit it though. And last but certainly not least, the light stopped working! I checked and replaced the batteries and it just stopped working all together so I'm thinking it wasn't so waterproof after all. Not happy with this product.<br /><br />On the plus side it was pretty sturdy so I gave it to my 5 month old to look at himself in when he is playing in the tub... figured I gotta get my money out of it somehow!\n",

Wavy is definitely easier to use than the corkscrew ones.<br />But yes worth the $$!\n",
      "33884->Some one can not count. | 2 | 0 | This item was a seven bottle pack, I order 2 packs. When arrived there was 13 sprayers, and 13 bottles. Someone can not count!<br />Other than missing a bottle. The product seems to be of good quality for the price.\n",
      "33891->refreshing | 4 | 0 | Love the scent of this soap.  It really helps to wake me up in the morning. I seems to help moisturize my skin; great for winter weather. When I first started to use it, I thought it was hard to rinse off, but it is the moisturizing elements in the soap.<br /><br />Works nicely in a three compartment shower dispenser.\n",
      "33913->Nice hair | 4 | 0 | Hair looks great. No smell really. Smells like pack hair. I did not dye or bleach it and it has different color strands through out. Soft before wash and even softer after a conditioner was added. Some sheading doing wash, but nothing to harp about. The longer length did turned in to more of a wave with curl on the end after washing, but it still works well.<br /><br />Only used 2 bundles for a full look, but all 3 can be used and it will still look fine. Had this hair installed (sew in) for about 4days, I just pineapple it and shake out in the morning. I would buy this hair again.\n",
      "33921->Too loose and duller colors than advertised | 2 | 0 | These headbands are already loose, so in putting it on my head it would slip right off.<br /><br />The worst of it is though the colors are super faded in person. If you look at the photo,<br />The two farthest left headbands look like my husband neckties, their so dark & bland.<br /><br />The photo advertised all of the colors looking significantly brighter. I returned the pack.\n",
      "33926->Does Not Work | 1 | 0 | I've used this everyday since purchase (couple of weeks now).  I can confidently say that this mask does absolutely nothing!!!!. It does not work.<br />Not sure how it got so many good reviews.  The seller probably begged purchasers for good review postings.  Dont waste your money buying this mask.\n",
      "33935->Not The Best Set Out There | 3 | 0 | Be warned, this is NOT “dip powder”. This is indeed acrylic powder in VERY small jars.<br /><br />This does not come with instructions though – at least mine didn’t. So that could make this a bit hard to work with.<br /><br />The colors are pretty though.<br /><br />This isn’t the best kit out there, I have seen better ones. The packaging isn’t that stable or durable. I ended up putting the jars in a pencil case.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn’t get it again. As far as durability, I usually do my manicure every week or so.\n",
      "33947->Broken | 2 | 0 | The larger piece comes off after very little pressure.<br />I cant even use it.\n",
      "33962->Allowed me to stop using styling products | 4 | 0 | I have fine hair and I've always had trouble with it getting frizzy and poofy. In the past I've used a variety of pomades, water wax, etc., to tame and weigh down my hair. But after switching to Wen I don't need to use anything. My hair is soft, not frizzy, and easy to control. Since I don't need to add any products it feels and looks better. The Tea Tree blend worked better on soothing my dry scalp than the Cucumber Aloe that I originally tried (got it as a gift).<br /><br />It's definitely worth the price, but I would give it 5 stars if it were a little more affordable. The gallon size helps make it more economical.\n",
      "33966->Don’t demonstrate 2 pens if only 1 | 3 | 0 | Showed 2 pens on demonstration so it made me think 2 for 2.99 however it was 1 @2.99 so I would not have purchased 2 pen for 6.00 when there are better ones for that price that come in 2 per pack.<br />Sorry I gave you 3 stars\n",
      "33990->Don't use this FACE wipe near EYES! | 2 | 0 | Is it soapy? No I guess not. Is it made of detergents and soap products that will agitate your eyes, YES! There is a warning on the package, you know that you'll read after you've wiped your eyes with this FACE wipe.<br /><br />It's a face wipe, it should be safe around the eyes.\n",
      "34001->A Nail Tech's view. Nice brush, but quite a bit smaller than other #8 brushes. 4 stars⭐ | 4 | 0 | This is a nice acrylic brush. It has a pretty pattern on the handle and the bristles are nice and straight. Though this #8 brush is smaller than all of my other #8 brushes, it works very well when applying acrylics. Whenever I get a new brush, I always do a burn test on a few of the bristle strands. The bristles in this brush are some kind of natural fiber or fur, but I can't say that it's a Kolinsky Sable, as true Kolinsky Sable is usually much more expensive. The bristles are rather short, leaving me to wonder how well the brush will hold up in the long run, but it should last a while..<br />Overall this is a nice acrylic nail brush, that has a very pretty pattern on its handle. It works well when applying acrylics, and I've had no problems with bristle loss. I would recommend this brush to those who are just starting out or those looking for a good budget brush.\n",
      "34009->If you are buying this for the beard balm, DO NOT! | 1 | 0 | The beard balm that I have bought separately from this pack has been AMAZING but the balm within this kit feels vaseline. Super greasy and disgusting feeling.<br /><br />I was so disappointed as I normally love the product. Just, disappointing.\n",
      "34046->Goes into skin well | 4 | 0 | I like this product, although I wish it had a higher SPF than 8. I thought it absorbed easily and didn't leave a white pasty look like some of my other screens with zinc. Love the squeeze bottle. If you are familiar with zinc type suncreens, I think you will like how this absorbs into the skin quickly and with very little rubbing. Zinc offers great protection from the sun's harmful rays.<br /><br />Not sure about the controversial ingredient titanium dioxide though. There is research out there, but I still don't know about the safety long term. I wish it had a better scent. I like Badger's scent of tangerine and vanilla, but I like Mexitan's because you don't have a pasty appearance after using.<br /><br />Seems to keep the sunburn away!\n",
      "34061->Nope | 1 | 0 | This razor is not great at all. It works and shaves the hair, but it’s not a close shave at all, you’re still left with a lot of stubble and we all know how much that stubble stage sucks already.<br />It says it’s meant for everywhere, even the bikini line, but let me tell you, DO NOT out this thing near your sensitive lady bits. I got the nastiest cut from this think and it hurt so bad, it literally ripped of skin. I have better luck with a cheap disposable dollar store razor and them things are crap.<br />The design is just awkward as well.<br />I definitely don’t recommend this.\n",
      "34071->Silky smooth hair | 5 | 0 | Review for: John Frieda Detox and Repair Shampoo and Conditioner Set, 8.45 Ounce Each with Nourishing Avocado Oil<br /><br />I am impressed with how fantastic this set makes my hair feel. After using both items, may hair is silky smooth and easy to style. It does not feel heavy or oily.<br /><br />The shampoo smells nice and lathers well. It also rinses out easily. The conditioner smells even better and makes a big difference how easy it is to comb through my wet hair. Once the conditioner is on, my hair feels very slippery and I can brush right through it.<br /><br />Both items come in a tube with a flip top. There is not security seal beneath the cap on either item.\n",
      "34086->Glass jar, yay! | 4 | 0 | It’s grainy, but smoothes with a lot of friction.<br />I LOVE that it’s in glass!\n",
      "34125->Poor Product | 1 | 0 | I bought these pouchs as gifts.  The string does not tighten sack, normal bar of soap does not fit in it.  And the soap slids out if you hang the sack.<br /><br />will not work as \"soap on a rope\" by putting soap in it.\n",
      "34139->It’s Okay... | 2 | 0 | The wig does not look like what they advertise ...<br />wish I could get my money back.\n",
      "34187->Three Stars | 3 | 0 | Like the earing but they turning black already.<br />So sad\n",
      "34197->Didn’t hold my straight lashes up | 3 | 0 | For anyone like myself who has stick straight lashes, this probably isn’t for you. In the photo, the eye that is circled has drooping lashes compared to the other eye which I put my usual waterproof mascara on. I did this to compare. I noticed within a minute of applying that my lashes started falling and didn’t hold up.<br /><br />I’m really big on waterproof mascaras because they are the only mascaras that will keep up my lashes. However, I dont believe this is waterproof. Perhaps it holds up better on normal lashes but not on someone like myself.\n",
      "34202->Hydrating and Healing | 5 | 0 | Harnessing the power of olive, these are wonderfully skin soothing drops. Not only do they moisturize, but they seem to heal minor irritations such as the little red spots that I get.<br />Expensive, but definitely worth it, especially on little imperfections that you wish would heal faster\n",
      "34206->Do Not Purchase | 2 | 0 | Does nothing it promises to do.<br />Difficult to applied correctly and evening sure to the inconsistency of liquid.\n",
      "34210->Nice | 4 | 0 | More like, she likes it. Overall I have to say that it's a good comb. Solid, nice design that doesn't seem like it will break unless abused...but you don't have to treat it like paper thin glass.<br /><br />Shipping exceeded expectations - as this is coming in from overseas, I thought it'd be 30-90 days, even with Prime. Nope, just a week.\n",
      "34214->Love the feeling of this mask | 4 | 0 | While the mask was a tiny bit small compared to most brands I have tried, it had plenty of serum and left my skin looking and feeling very hydrated and soothed. I knew it has tea tree oil in it, which I love, but it was slightly too tingly for me to have on for 20min. and I had to take it off a little sooner. It didn’t harm my skin in any way, but I don’t love the tingles.<br />I do love the cellulose material of this mask, it’s so much better for the environment!\n",
      "34240->Really cute! | 5 | 0 | Loved these clips! My daughters loved them and they frequently ask for the butterflies for their hair!!<br />They are well built, propely sized, and they come in a great color selection!<br />I recommend these 5/5!\n",
      "34254->Spa mask to refresh and brighten | 5 | 0 | I bought into some hype and bought a set of Gold masks. You know the ones...expensive face shaped masks that are somewhere between gummi bear and un-gelled Jello. And while using it, you look somewhere between King Tut and C-3PO, the Star Wars robot. Afterward you feel like a Ghostbuster that got slimed.<br /><br />Forget all that and relax with nourishing botanicals. The ingredients soothe and help reduce splotchies and redness.<br />Spa quality facials at home.\n",
      "34261->Not purple power | 3 | 0 | The shampoo is very thin and watery..runs off the palm of hand. Conditioner is thick and will not dispense..<br />Very annoying.\n",

      "34279->Simply wonderful ingredients 👇! Feels lovely. | 5 | 0 | This Hydro-Plumping Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a simple, yet a powerhouse serum. It has wonderful moisturizing, anti-aging, antioxidant, and calming ingredients that are top notch. There are several types of super moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid. It also has Green Tea, which is proven to be an excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial superstar.<br />This is a wonderful serum to use during your day or night routine. I like to apply it to damp, or well hydrated skin. Usually after applying a few layers of my toner. It applies and absorbs easily, and a little does go a long way. Any slight tackiness is taken care of after applying a good moisturizer to help lock in all the good stuff. It has a very light, hardly noticeable scent.<br />It really hydrates my skin and plumps my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks and feels better when using it. I have combination skin, but use Retin-A, which can be a bit drying and sometimes irritating. This serum really calms the irritation, yet enhances the anti-aging effects of the Retin-A.<br />This serum is a great every day serum. Especially for those who have sensitive and/or dry skin, but is beneficial for any skin type. It has great ingredients, and is not loaded with harsh chemicals, and provides so much good stuff for your skin. It is a simple, yet powerful serum. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The stars of this serum are:<br /><br />~Antioxidant: Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate<br />~Skin-identical ingredient: Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin<br />~Soothing: Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br /><br />Simple, yet super ingredients!<br /><br />Other Ingredients:<br /><br />~Buffering: Sodium Hydroxide<br />~Chelating: Sodium Phytate<br />~Emollient: Lecithin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br />~Emulsifying: Lecithin<br />~Moisturizer/humectant: Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin<br />~Perfuming: Benzyl Alcohol<br />~Preservative: Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid<br />~Solvent: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol<br />~Viscosity controlling: Benzyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Carbomer\n",

      "34328->Good | 4 | 0 | I ordered this for our daughter (teenager) who is really in to skin care. She reports that this face cleaner works well and doesn't dry out her skin. She also likes the gel texture.<br /><br />She wasn't thrilled about how many ingredients the product contains and she said she believes that so many ingredients in one product can't be as effective as they would be if they were applied in the right order separately. For example, applying vitamin C while washing stuff off your face accomplishes what, exactly? She actually made the analogy to \"order of operations\" in solving algebra problems. I was so proud of my skin care math nerd daughter in that moment.\n",
      "34331->Super Small Fit! | 2 | 0 | This was super small and wouldn’t fit my kid. It actually left lines on the forehead and started causing a headache after only 5 minutes of trying it out.<br /><br />As for the look … not gonna lie, it’s weird.\n",
      "34354->Meh.... | 2 | 0 | Not impressed. Small container, pump dispenser works when it feels like it....<br />On a positive note, doesn’t leave a heavy or greasy film\n",
      "34360->Depends on your use if these will work for you. | 3 | 0 | I bought these to help remove powder nail dip. These did not work and the polish remover would evaporate quickly.<br /><br />I decided to just dip my fingers in a bag with nail polish remover in a bowl of hot water.<br /><br />The files, buffers and scrapper I love using! The finger clips-not so much.\n",
      "34381->For cosplay | 5 | 0 | If you are into cosplay or just historical costumes, then this wig is a lot of fun. It comes with a necklace, earrings and a set of buck teeth. I ditched the teeth. Easy to wear wig which comes with a nice stretchy adjustable cap and a hair net to keep your own locks locked down. It's a fun, creative wig and I hope to see a lot of other styles in the future.<br />The hair itself it auburn. Not too fake looking. The hair line is a bit of a struggle but I got it right .\n",
      "34393->Good stuff, but they won't tell you how much to use in a hot soak bath, or for any other purpose. | 4 | 0 | I like this stuff.  I add it to my hot bath soaks  One thing that really bugs me is that the manufacturer won't tell you how much to use for different things, such as a hot soak bath, v/s, say, a poultice for the skin.<br /><br />I can figure out the poultice.  Just add water until it's the right consistency for a poultice.<br /><br />But the bath?  Since this company won't give you a \"suggested use,\" I have been forced to turn to other sources to find the answer.  Half the websites I read say you need \"four to five cups\" of montmorillonite clay if you want an excellent hot soak bath.<br /><br />Well, hell, that's more than comes in the entire little one pound container -- for a single bath!  So...if that's the case, I won't be buying this stuff any longer.  To add four or five cups of this stuff to every bath would cost close to $20 per bath.  Too expensive.\n",
      "34404->Peel off base coat works! | 4 | 0 | After years of damage to my natural nails I’ve been trying to rehab them back to health so I went cold turkey with all the dip powder, gel polish even regular polish. Now that they are some what back to normal I wanted to paint them however I hate using regular nail polish. I take the time to polish and then they chip the next day, so annoying. I wanted to try gel polish but didnt want to ruin my nails again (I have super sensitive, thin brittle nails) so I thought maybe a peel off base coat would help.<br /><br />I decided to try the peel off base coat on 2 of my nails just to be safe. After 2 days I peeled it off and my nails has minimal damage. The top coat however was super thick! Made my nails look unnaturally thick and lumpy, maybe I got an old one.\n",
      "34446->Not worth the money. | 3 | 0 | Not worth the price.<br />It's nice, but it doesn't cover more than a spot.\n",
      "34466->Disappointed | 1 | 0 | These are so hard to put on, they do not stick.<br />Don't waste your money!\n",
      "34467->Pamper Your Body and Soul | 5 | 0 | Highly fragranced set, beautifully hand packed with tissue.<br />You can order this with confidence if you are giving it as a gift, because an outer cardboard box protects the gift box itself from any shipping damage.<br />Just opening it up is a delight. The aroma is soothing with natural fragrance. Not a hint of off chemical odors, just fresh essential oils, blended for a peaceful experience.<br />I especially like the petite candle that is a lovely way to complete the experience. You can have a candle lit bath using the bath gel, and spray the linens with the pillow spray for a calming and sleep inducing experience.<br /><br />Very caring gift for someone facing challenges and stress\n",
      "34483->Mine was MISSING THREE PADS!  Returning! | 1 | 0 | Literally they repackage these without checking what’s inside.<br /><br />Mine was missing three of the four pads.  Also, it is very small and flimsy. This cost about $2 to make.\n",
      "34488->Bulky, short-lived, doesn’t work well | 1 | 0 | I bought this product based on these reviews, but the product doesn’t match the quality and descriptions in this reviews.<br />This product has lasted 6 months for me. The comb guard for the eyebrow trimmer doesn’t fit well and is too deep to give you neat, tidy eyebrows. It leaves you with bushy eyebrows. So it’s pointless. It’s also bulky. The Remington trimmers and Wahl trimmers I’ve had were about the size of a pen light. This trimmer is much larger. My biggest complaint is that it sits in the box it came in, in a cabinet, and simply stopped working at six months. It didn’t even last through one full battery. I changed the battery and put a fresh battery out of the package in the trimmer and it’s still as dead as a stone.<br />Total waste of money!\n",
      "34493->Learning curve | 4 | 0 | It took me a while to learn the right amount of pressure to get fine strokes when applied over the eyebrow hair. Unfortunately I left it in my pocket and in the washer it went... and spilled in the cap.<br />I'll have to order another one, I like it lasts about 24hours, for now dark gray eye shadow and a fine slanted eyeliner brush I guess\n",

They repeatedly asked that I remove or upgrade this review based on their excellent customer service . I asked if the bags still smelled and they replied in the affirmative. Therefor I am adding this information to  my review . The bags may smell for a few weeks , but they may give you your money back .\n",

      "34549->GREAT FOR USE AT HOME | 5 | 0 | Great brush.  The bristles are quite soft, but not too soft, and the brush is very comfortable to use.  I keep my hair fairly short, and for that's this brush is perfect.  However, I suspect that someone with long hair might find that the bristles are not long enough.<br /><br />I will say that this is a large brush, so not great for travel, but for home use, it's perfect.\n",
      "34550->hopeful | 5 | 0 | I like this series of products from Amelie. Each unique cream and at the same time to supplement another. I already have a moisturizing and brightening cream. And then came the moment when the seller me the honor to give a significant discount on this product. I am very happy, because this series is my favorite! This cream is all that is necessary so our skin, especially pleases<br />more than 70% organic ingredients, effectively rejuvenate the skin balanced and not abuse it. I will not say that my skin looks does not matter, I'm already more than two months of use creams from Amelie, but wrinkles - that's my problem. I am a very emotional person, and my spirits give my wrinkles, so this cream - a godsend for me.

      "34555->Tips are very weak | 3 | 0 | I've gone back and forth on these.  On one hand, they are very cost effective, and you get four rhinestone pickers instead of one which is a huge plus.<br /><br />However, I find I go through the soft end of the rhinestone picker faster than I do other units.  For instance, I have one rhinestone picker from UberChic beauty which I have had for over 6 months, and it still maintains its original shape and is only showing slight dulling at the tip.  However, these units are very soft on the white end, and have actually chipped/worn away quickly.  In a month and a half I have already used up one and the majority of a second.<br /><br />They do a good job at what they are meant for, and I have not had any issues at all with picking up rhinestones.  However, the white end is just too soft, and considering tips have broken off/worn away so quickly I have to give this 3/5.\n",

After a couple years, it needed a comeback, so I bought Seche Restore to, well, restore my SV. It took a couple droppers, but it worked great.<br /><br />Please don't use nail polish remover to thin your polish. It destroys your polish.<br />(Seche BEST top coat ever.

      "34656->Gel Mold Remover - Doesn't work so well | 2 | 0 | The order comes with one (1) mold remover that comes in a bottle. it comes with a cone shaped cap that you replace so you can dispense the mold remover gel. It allows for you to get to the corners and edges where the mold builds up and it's hard to scrub unless you have a thin brush to work with.<br /><br />The gel is clear and you squeeze the bottle for it to come out. It's pretty much the gel sitting on top of a molded sealant in my showers that is supposed to slowly kill the mold and you remove it by wiping it down a few hours later. The gel clumps and it stays there. I have seen it work slowly but it does not remove much of the built up mold.\n",

It kept me dry and odor-free all day.<br /><br />The only negative is that it feels a bit waxy when you apply it.

Once in a while I like to check out another line to trade off for a while.  This line, Wow.  I am impressed so far.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  The bottle inside is glass with a lock pump top.  Turn to the side and you can pump and then turn it back and it locks.<br /><br />TEXTURE OF THE LOTION<br />This is what I would think of as a lotion texture.  Thick, but not too thick.<br /><br />MY SKIN TYPE<br />I tend to have normal to dry skin and it has some uneven patches on it which most probably don't notice, but I do.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I start with the XXI cleanser which is great stuff.  Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway).  I really have been thankful to have them right now.  They have given me a boost when I really needed one.\n",

      "34716->Didn't get 50 or free hairband | 1 | 0 | **EDITED REVIEW- Vendor reached out to me and refunded and also sent new order. They feel great in my hair.  VERY HAPPY<br /><br />Looks like an inferior product.  I dont think they will even last. I received 42 and missing 8 along with the free hairband advertised. Not worth a trip to kohls to return and waste my gas.\n",
      "34720->Almost but not quite | 3 | 0 | I like that it keeps cloth mask off my mouth. Unfortunately it does not grasp the cloth folds the way it is described.  Perhaps the mask material is too thick.<br /> I'm sure it works with disposable masks.  I also find i sweat under the bracket, getting kind of drippy after a while of walking.  Good idea but disappointing.  Nice that they c pico me 5 in a pack for families (I'm single).\n",
      "34734->Buyer beware | 1 | 0 | This stuff caused my fingernail top layer to come off. It was like a fungus. It never happened to me before.<br />Would not recommend.\n",
      "34763->Glamour | 3 | 0 | Was aware that the delivery time would be long and it was long.  I painted my nails the same day it arrived, after letting the polish get to room temperature.  The polish brush is really nice.  Polish looks nice but does not look like the layered salon applied gel nails as far as thickness.<br /><br />This was the best price I could find on the internet.  Do not know how it will hold up.  Hoping for a week, since the box promises 14 days.\n",
      "34774->Good for the price | 4 | 0 | A pretty good product<br />It’s simple to use and works well\n",
      "34777->Expensive facial oil that moisturizes nicely though | 3 | 0 | I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Deep Hydration oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with avocado oil, helichrysum oil, red ginseng, shitake mushroom and elderflower. This particular blend is supposed to be soothing, regenerating and anti-aging, while moisturize your skin and protect it from dehydration. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.\n",
      "34789->Mine didn’t work | 2 | 0 | I needed this & was excited to finally receive it but it didn’t work. No continuous spray like the ones at the salon which is disappointing especially for those who struggle with arthritis. I keep trying!!<br /><br />I gave the seller back some stars because they took care of the issue after I contacted  them twice.<br /><br />I cannot recommend\n",
      "34796->Great! | 5 | 0 | This was my first time buying Maven scrunchies. I wasn’t sure if they’d work for me because I have a lot of hair. Most scrunchies don’t hold all of my hair. These do. If I’m doing a bun I can get it around my bun twice. I haven’t tried a ponytail yet.<br /><br />These are well made and don’t feel cheep.\n",
      "34802->Excellent for Dry Skin | 5 | 0 | If you are an ashy kind of gal then you need some body in your life!<br /><br />I'm always up for trying something new so I was excited to try this ULTRA LIGHT FULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL.<br /><br />I think it works best if you put it on while your skin is still damp right out of the bath or a shower. I also try to exfoliate a little bit especially on my legs and other problem areas like elbows and knees.<br /><br />It's lightly scented which I like because if it's too overpowering it can really flare up my allergies.<br /><br />I wouldn't use something like this on my face because I do tend to be on the oily side. But for the body it really works great!\n",
      "34832->My mistake | 3 | 0 | I was in such a hurry, so I thought this was like regular cocoa powder only organic raw. Forgot the days when I prevented stretch marks with cocoa butter.<br />Great for that!! Just not what I wanted!\n",
      "34889->A real review from a hair ADDICT! | 3 | 0 | I want to give my honest opinion on this Hair the reason I gave it three stars was because the smell I ordered three bundles and the smell was very strong and really hard to get rid of.<br />My first impression upon opening the hair was that it was very soft and very wavy looks exactly like the pictures however it seems to me that there is something on the hair making it have that exact pattern for every bundle. I’ve been buying here over 20 years and I’ve bought a very expensive top quality hair for a 19 1/2 of those 20 years. I was seeking hair that is cheaper because I’m tired of spending so much money on hand. For the money of this hair it’s really good I washed the three<br /> Bundles and felt that they were very soft very slick when washing no shedding while washing but the pattern was different after I washed the hair which is fine for me in order to get the curl pattern back I had to use promax gel and leave in moisturizer. As far as tangling yes there is tangling all hair tangles. I don’t care what hair you have it is going to tangle it is not excessive tingling that I’ve experience with this hair !It’s just normal tangling because I sleep on it without braiding it up so no Matting  and no shedding! That is the most important thing to me is that hair doesn’t matter and shit I’ve had bad experiences the last few months with chatting with other hair so I’m happy to find this I do like the hair I will order it again for the price you really can’t beat it all though let me add I did sell the wefts because I’m paranoid! The hair is a finer texture like baby fine hair so when it’s not put into the wet looks state it may look frizzy. Overall I agree with most of the reviews on here that the hair is nice soft and doesn’t shit doesn’t tangle as much.I have only had the hair in two weeks so I plan to do an update later on\n",
      "34896->it didnt look like much when i got it in the mail | 5 | 0 | it is gorgeous on, it didnt look like much when i got it in the mail, but when i put it on and accessorized it, it was WOW!<br />everyone love it and compliments it.  it would make an awesome gift too, just need earrings to match it.\n",
      "34911->This is a good set of contouring colors | 4 | 0 | This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.\n",
      "34930->Pretty hair gems | 3 | 0 | Pros: These gems are easy to use with a straight iron to activate the adhesive on the back of each gem. They sparkle nicely and are very unique to other types of hair gems since you can place them basically anywhere on your hair.<br />My daughter loved them!<br />Cons: I used to sell these hair gems when I worked in the Mall, and the packs were sold for $5.00 each (much cheaper than ordering online)<br />Some of the gems were not placed in the package evenly, where some gems were clumped together on the sticky paper. This makes it more cumbersome to use/cut out.<br />I had considered returning due to the gems being clumped together in the packaging, but wanted to use them for my daughters Christmas concert and didn’t have time to deal with the hassle of returning/exchanging\n",
      "34932->A true disappointment, read before you buy! | 2 | 0 | I'll start by saying that I'm using oils for more than 5 years, I know what to look for, and I've used many different companies.<br /><br />I wanted to try this company for a long time, but I thought the price is too high (more on that later), and I can get a triple amount of oil by different companies for the same price,<br />After a bit of reviews reading, and recommendations by youtubers (which now I believe they were paid reviews) I decided to try anyway,<br /><br />The cost of the 4 oils package is 50$, additional 4$ for the \"premium\" scents, which I took 2 of, and a very high 10$~ shipping cost- when all the other sellers offer free shipping,<br />Sums out at around 64$~ for 4oz oil (and to be honest, I usually buy grave before shave 4 oz bottle of my favorite smell for 25$ Inc. Shipping).<br /><br />The delivery wasn't fast, but i knew it from the beginning, but also didn't include any tracking or home delivery(unlike other companies) so I basically paid a lot for waiting a lot and picking it up from the post office without knowing when it will come.<br /><br />The package was great! It was very well packed, also included 2×tiny branded cloth bags, and I really liked it.<br /><br />I've ordered those smells:<br /><br />1.The ladies man- lovely lemon vanilla smell, very gentle but precise.<br /><br />2.The outlaw- supposed to be tobacco, vanilla and pepper but smells really bad, usually this is my favorite smell from every company, but this one was horrible, something between a sewer and a dirty toilet,<br />I gave it a chance anyways, thought maybe im exaggerating , 3 minutes after my girlfriend asked me to wash my face.<br /><br />3.ell burrista (premium +2$)- coffee,<br />Idk what is so premium about it, smells just like every other coffee artificial smell, not even a true representation of real coffee smell,<br />Might come in handy for some people but ,not my cup of tea ;), and I'm saying that as a coffee lover.<br /><br />4. The royal knight(premium +2$)-<br />Well, I know lavender, I know vanilla and I know earl grey tea smells,<br />But it not even close,<br />This one gives the vibes of a chemical air refresher smell (maybe it'll work with the toilet smell of the outlaw), with a hint of a 70 years old man cologne.<br /><br />Moreover, I'll state that the scents stays for 10-30min and then it's gone, while I'm truly happy that those horrible scents gone fast, I would really like the only good scent(ladies man) to stay more.., some companies have the opposite problem though.<br /><br />My beard is medium sized, and usually I use 4-7 drops (depends on the day since it's quite hot in here all of the year), but it felt like I had to use around 10 drops to really nourish my skin.<br /><br />All that being said, The quality of the product itself is great and I do not feel any dryness or itchiness at all.<br /><br />I really hope the company will see that review and improve over time, really liked the idea of the scents and wanted to justify the price, but I'm too disappointed and I do not think it's even justified to sell those at half the price.<br /><br />Hoped it helped someone, stay bearded\n",
      "34936->Pleasantly surprised by this product..... | 5 | 0 | I've used the same aloe vera gel for a number of years but when it was discontinued, I had to find a substitute. Bipin's production criteria and list of ingredients were both in keeping with what I seek in this type of product.  I know that some people are put off by the words \"made in China\" but I've learned that does not automatically mean a poor quality product or an ineffective one.  And while this gel might not be the right one for everybody else, it is working for me and even better than the one it replaced.<br /><br />I thought it reasonably priced.  It was carefully shrink-wrapped to avoid any leakage, bottled in convenient size (box of two), and neither too runny nor too thick in consistency.  Some reviewers mention an odor or aroma of some kind but I detected no such thing.  Initially it seemed a bit wet in application but then was fully absorbed after a few seconds and left no sticky or gummy feeling whatsoever.  This is a dream come true for my skin which seems to have become drier and more sensitive with age.  I have used it frequently over several days and have passed the point where I'd encounter a bad reaction so I'm more confident now that I made the right choice.  Too soon to tell if it will have a lasting positive impact but thus far, everything is in the plus column.\n",

      "34962->A little bigger than it needs to be.  3.5/5 stars | 4 | 0 | This brush was pretty nice overall as a foundation brush. But it is slightly bigger than it needs to be, in my opinion. Which meant it was hard to not get it into my hairline a bit.<br /><br />I also found that the hair of the brush wasn't necessarily packed as tight together as other brands I've used. This means more of the liquid foundation seeps into the brush/is kind of wasted. But overall, it still worked really well. I think brushes are a much better alternative to fingers and I like the smooth, blended look it created.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the handle wasn't the stiffest... so I ended up holding it pretty high up on the handle, but that wasn't really a problem.\n",
