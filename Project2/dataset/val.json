I was sold.<br \/><br \/>Norelco Reflex Plus shavers combine 4 features pioneered by Norelco and improved over time. Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers. Floating heads individually hug the skin. Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave. Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.<br \/><br \/>I've been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn't a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I'd expect from a Norelco.<br \/><br \/>The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black & Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn't nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!<br \/><br \/>A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words \"MADE IN HOLLAND\" on the bottom of every Norelco I've owned.<br \/><br \/>Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.","helpful_vote":117,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":2,"title":"Colors off","text":"Colors did not look like they do online","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely awful, fall apart straight out of the package.","text":"If I could give ZERO STARS I would!

I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.<br \/><br \/>This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these &#34;Direct dye&#34; bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).<br \/><br \/>My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower\/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility \/ laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.","helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"Cables failed quickly","text":"2 of 4 cables failed in less than 3 weeks.

I'm always a little leery of brushing since I don't want to ruin my brushes or potentially harm my nightguard. Soaking it in some mouthwash is helpful, but then that isn't the same as a thorough clean.<br \/><br \/>The taste of this is fairly nice. I like that it's not extremely overwhelming. You can wipe your guard down and it won't be insanely strong. There will be a hint of flavor, but overall it's not going to be anything that will knock your socks off. This might be disappointing for some, but it's still a better thing to taste than the alternative. If you have a guard of any type, you know what I'm talking about.<br \/><br \/>This will get into most of the crevices and areas of the average guard. You'll have to cram it into the more small areas, but it will fit everywhere. It seems to do a fairly good job of cleaning as well. I'd read that it could help get rid of stains and other discolorations, which is the biggest thing that appealed to me. So far I've done a few cloths and it seems to be helping a little. It's not a miracle worker, but then I wasn't expecting it to be and to be honest, I'd be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately.

Kind of a bulky, rounded handle that offers no secure contour to grab onto.<br \/><br \/>The real issue that I have is that I think it offers a pretty lousy shave.  There are 5 blades, a moisture strip and some other strip that makes it a bulky head that feels like I'm dragging a razor paddle across my face.  I find that it does not offer a very close shave and I have to go over spots numerous times and still I will sometimes realize later in the morning\/day that I have a rough spot somewhere that was not cleanly shaved.  Particularly along the jawline where my face is more curved and not so flat.  The bulkiness of the razor head is also a nuisance for shaving mustache area, you can't get a close shave under your nose, you have to use the single blade detailer side which I don't care for using on the front of my face.<br \/><br \/>I do like their shave gel, it smells nice and makes for an otherwise smooth shaving experience.

I'm upgrading the review from 1 star to 4 stars just because their customer service surprised me (pleasantly) so much!","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"1\/4 and 3\/4","text":"I was so excited to get these.  I opened the bag, counted them to make sure there were 30.  I also separated them from what I would use and what I probably won't and while doing that, I found that roughly 3\/4 of them are in good shape and the other 1\/4 are not cut deep enough to get a mold piece.  (And yes, the ones that don't look cut well, I tried them out to make sure they just weren't suppose to be cut deep enough.  Well, those ARE suppose to be cut deeper than they are.)  Because of this I don't think they're really worth the price of $15.  It's a shame the seller doesn't make sure their product is top notch.  The designs are cute, the material is easy to release the mold designs and vey easy to clean.  Therefore, if not for the ones that aren't cut well, this would be well worth the price.<br \/><br \/>Because of the positive things I mentioned, I gave this review 3 stars.  But, for recommending these, I'm On the fence.  If you don't mind a few to half not being usable, then yes, I recommend taking your chances with ordering these.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you shop around a little more for better quality and guarantee of the product.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Love these for my work!","text":"Great item!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Rubbish","text":"Total waste of money, this is synthetic hair and does not blend, it sticks out","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","text":"Love \ud83d\udc96","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Burns and itches","text":"I had a major problem with this product.

As expected my hair peaked though. I ended up tying up my bottom layer and  putting the extensions on top. It solved the problem of the hair poking though.<br \/>\u2022 For these extensions to work for me I would need to buy at least two more packs of hair.

I had to spend a good amount of time and hairspray to get it looking remotely like Nico's hairstyle and even then it can use some shears and a bit of work. It is sufficiently thick, I will give it that. Too often on amazon you find cosplay wigs that are thin as hell and practically worthless for styling. I will be adding more wefts to the back, teasing, and curling it further to get more of that bouffant thickness. My biggest complaint is the hairline. I wasn't expecting a \"lace front\" realistic hairline but the front of this wig is so thick with hair that it creates a bump from one's scalp which ruins the illusion of it being one's real hair; or at least close enough to it that people just accept it. This bump is so pronounced that it can be viewed easily from 3 feet away that its an obvious wig.

Ordered 2 groups (which were 6 packs in all), but I still don't think it was quite full enough. The hair comes in 3 (or in my case 6) individual packs (PIC) with a twist wire going through. Care must be taken to not let each piece slip off until you are used to the loop because you may lose the grip of the loop. The loop holes are pretty small so you'll lose some strands if you cant get a hold of the loop properly because the hair will unravel if you manipulate it too much (PICs). Also the hair is a bit too shiny to look natural (PIC) although I still got compliments. It comes with hair clips and a loop needle package (PIC) with each order so I wound up with two needles and two sets of clips. At this point I've had it in one week and though it still looks ok, there is a lot of frizzing up at the root so I'm not going to be able to wear it for a month like i planned, I can tell already. Didn't notice any real shedding though the unraveling makes up for it. It'd probably better to order an extra pack if you want to wear it for a while since you should switch out the individual locs as they fray. Lastly the metal clips that are included are nice to cap off the look, but they tarnish pretty quickly.

I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br \/><br \/>If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out.

The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price...

Because the wand brush has 2 sides to it (a short rubber bristle side and a longer bristle side) I am actually able to get to the BASE of the lashes on my lid and rotate the wand to the longer bristle side to coat each lash while separating them - on the FIRST application!  The result is PERFECT each and every time without the mess, clumping, stickiness, etc that almost EVERY other brush causes.  The other thing I noticed immediately is that since the brush doesn\u2019t taper at the end like most brushes do, I actually get mascara on my inner lashes (near the nose bridge) without making a clumping mess!  My current Triple Play has been finished for a while now and I\u2019ve just been (unhappily) using THIS wand to apply my other mascaras! :-)).

However You Get What You Pay For Though!","text":"UPDATE: 08-01-21<br \/><br \/>Its been nearly another year that I've owned these shavers, which makes a total of 3-years of ownership. Has my opinion on these shavers changed? Well, one just has to take a look at my updated rating and you have your answer. About a month after my first replacement, (which you can read about in the 2020 update) I discovered that the battery wasn't holding a charge as good as my first shaver, it got so bad that the charger would die, unless I had it plugged in all the time. This did not give me confidence at all!<br \/><br \/>Also, the cutting head from the get go, felt like it wasn't as sharp as the first shavers cutting head. I mean, we all know the blade isn't made out of Japanese steel but this is ridiculous, a new shaver head should be sharp! Because I did not want to write this product off too soon, I continued using the shaver for almost a complete year, and now the shaver head feels as dull as the last shaver after 2-years of use. For an entire year, this shaver was providing me a nice shade of red rash on my neck, nothing like walking into a store looking like you just came back from getting tortured by someone.<br \/><br \/>I simply could not put up with it anymore, and I am sorry to have to admit this, but I went back to a name brand shaver. I did my research, and I discovered that Panasonic was still making quality shavers made in Japan. I decided to also switch from a rotary design shaver, to a foil design shaver, as they provide a closer shave. The Panasonic Arc4 ES 8243AA is a much nicer shaver hands down! If you want to take 30-minutes for a red rash shave, then stick with Aefee, if you want a 10-minute shave that leaves you looking good afterwords, get the Panasonic.<br \/><br \/>Review has been updated to 3 out of 5 stars as of August 1st 2021...<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: 09-05-20<br \/><br \/>My wonderful shaver has recently been pulling my hairs, and taking twice as long to shave, which is due to the shaving head being dull. I went searching for replacement heads for my shaver, saw that there used to be some that were sold on Amazon, but they are out of stock, with no confidence that they will be back in stock, anytime soon. I saw that this shaver was still being sold to this day, and for cheaper then before! I thought, for 17-dollars, that would be about the same cost for a replacement head, for a cheap shaver, might as well buy a new one, even if my old one still works. I then decided it was time to go and update my review to reflect the longevity I got out of my old shaver.<br \/><br \/>Only to discover that it wasn't 1-year that I've owned my shaver like I thought, but 2-years! My oh my how time flies. That means, that I have been shaving on the original cutting head for 2-years, thats unheard of for electric shavers, holy cow! So there is my longevity review guys, 2-years, still kicking, just needs a new head, but no replacement head in stock. 17-dollars is all I had to pay to buy a new shaver, its a no brainer. So, guys, if your looking for a shaver that is going to get the job done, this is what you need. Now, if the company can get replacement heads back in stock that would be great. But for now, you can just buy a new shaver when your head goes dull.<br \/><br \/>I am keeping my review at 5-STARS!  :)<br \/><br \/>Original Review:<br \/><br \/>I have used several electric shavers in my life, all of them being Norelco. I was never a fan of the two-bladed shavers, I grow a thick beard, and it just takes too long to shave with those things. The 3-bladed shavers can be hit or miss depending on brand\/model. Norelco used to make quality shavers back in the 80's and 90's. Since Phillips's acquisition of the Norelco brand however, the quality has gone down drastically. Many reviews complain of underpowered motors, motors burning out early, and poor shaving quality, unless of course you buy the high end 200 dollar model, then your in heaven lol.<br \/><br \/>Thankfully these day, we have a choice. I don't know about you, but I am not in the rich income bracket, I can't just dump 200 dollars into a shaver just to get something that is quality.  Fortunately, there are many different types of shavers made in China now, that are much more affordable. What sold me on this shaver, is that it uses a 800MAH lithium rechargeable battery, that can be charged via USB. It uses a pretty blue LED battery indicator display, which shows minutes of run-time remaining.<br \/><br \/>It uses a standard 3-bladed system, with a pop up side-burn trimmer. It is also easy to pop the blades off and clean them, and even though I didn't require this feature, it is also IPX7 waterproof. The shaver comes with a nice velvet pouch, a brush, USB cable, and a operators manual. When I turned the unit on, I couldn't believe how quiet this thing runs, most certainly quieter then the old 80's - 90's Norelco models. So the question you might be asking is, how does it perform?<br \/><br \/>If all you have is stubble, you can expect this to provide a pretty smooth shave within a reasonable amount of time. I just did nice and slow rotational movements, as you are supposed to do with this type of shaver, and it did a pretty good job! If you let your beard get beyond a stubble, as one would expect, it does take longer to get the job done, but the shaver was able to do it, and seemed to have enough power, not just in time duration, but also in horse power.<br \/><br \/>Since I did not do a wet shave with this, I can't speak as to its effectiveness. I bought an electric shaver for the convenience of a dry shave, as wet shaving is a pain in the but for me. While the water proof rating allows one to simply run the head under the water stream to clean it out, I however just used the brush that they supplied, and some canned air, and it did just as good, without fully taking the blades out of the head. Recharge time is faster then they state when utilizing a powerful Anker wall charger that puts out 3 amps. I charged my battery from 45 minutes left, to 60-minutes left, in only 20 minutes.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, I believe this to be a very nice electric shaver. And for the price I paid for it, I expected it to be weaker in construction, however, that is further from the truth. The construction of this shaver is top notch, and rivals higher end Phillips Norelco's in my humble opinion. If you need a quality electric shaver that will get the job done, and doesn't break the bank, I highly recommend this one! 5 out of 5 stars!","helpful_vote":147,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"I bought silver and black as pink and gold sold ...","text":"I bought silver and black as pink and gold sold out.

The first thing I noticed is that everything smells fantastic! A strong coffee fragrance wafts from everything in this kit, and all three body products contain real coffee. The scrub was my personal favorite scent-wise; I find it smells just like a caramel lattee.<br \/><br \/>The body bar is nourishing and non-drying, but it is exfoliating due to the coffee grounds, so I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. I do personally wish it was a tad larger, as it melts down quickly during typical usage.<br \/><br \/>The scrub is quite dense, as it doesn't contain added liquid. However, this means you get a lot for your money, as you only need to use a little bit on damp skin to get good exfoliation.  I like the addition of almond and coconut oil, as it keeps it from being overly harsh, and makes it quite hydrating.<br \/><br \/>A little goes a long way with the bath soak. I love using it in a foot bath; It leaves my feet feeling nice and soft, and the aroma is relaxing and pleasant. It does dye the water a light brown due to the coffee, however.<br \/><br \/>I like the candle, but I'd consider it my least favorite out of this set. It has a nice burn time for its size, and it's in a beautiful black candle tin with a lid. However, I found the amount of scent it provided while burning to be underwhelming.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I really like this spa kit, and I think it'd be fantastic for any coffee lover. It's a little expensive at the current price, but if the candle was a little stronger, and the bath bar was a little larger, then this would be a five-star product.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"Not 18 inches","text":"I have 18 inch locks that I regularly use, and I bought these to mix with them.

I have lost soooo many cheap combs simply cause they fell outta my back pocket.  This one stays put, has the bottle opener and combs through my hair without pulling.

She acts like she loves it, but she hasn't worn it yet... And she was looking at it weird when she was first examining it.

It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br \/>The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br \/>I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream\/lotion that was left in the package.<br \/>This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br \/>These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right.

The consistency is disgusting, the color is gross, and the &#34;scent&#34; is an odd fruity-type scent that isn't pleasing by any means.  Every time I open up the jar, there is a very unappealing product inside.  Nonetheless, I went ahead and began using it and after only a few weeks, I have noticed a small difference.  My scarring does look lighter, so that's a good thing.  However, I think my product has already turned stale!  I have closed it tight after each use, but it seems to have changed.  It looks the same, but the &#34;scent&#34; is now completely atrocious!  There's not a trace of that barely &#34;fruity&#34; scent anymore.  It has turned into a putrid smell, and I almost can't even bear to use it.  It seems as if almost overnight it turned from barely fruity to entirely unbearable.  I can't even put my finger on what it smells like now.  The best way to describe the smell is &#34;chemical,&#34; which leads me to think this may not be as natural of a product as the company claims.

In comes Belle!<br \/><br \/>Let me just say for the record, I bought the purple one with the base because apparently they have the pink one shown that doesn't come with the base. (I'm gonna order that one but I'll get to that in just a minute). This system is wonderful.....no mess, nice and clean and you can keep it on the base so that means it's upright and no worries about dripping wax. Once you've used it, I'd suggest wiping the wax head off just to get the wax residue off from your usage.<br \/><br \/>The base comes with an additional plug outlet on the side which is why I'm ordering the pink one for 14.99. It appears you can heat two cartridges at the same time and I'm ecstatic about that.<br \/><br \/>The wax it came with went on smooth and to my surprise only needed one more application to remove my underarm hair. Put a little baby powder under your arm prior to waxing as this will create a smoother process and absorb any oil and moisture. With the Nair Roll On Wax, I sometimes had to do three to four applications to get all the hair and ya know that's not good for your skin when you're waxing.<br \/><br \/>Now for the one star deduction.....I went back and forth with whether I should give 5 stars or 4 stars but I think 4 stars is still pretty darn good. The reason for this is the time it takes to heat the wax up. It took mine 25 minutes. That can seem like a long time when you're used to putting wax in the microwave and it's ready under 2 minutes. It's only a minor issue however the system definitely makes up for this plus you can order more cartridges in different scents.<br \/><br \/>Overall, great buy and you won't regret it. If you were a Nair Roll On Hair Remover fan like I was, you can kiss the days of paying for overpriced Nair rollers on Amazon goodbye, since they've discontinued it and third party sellers are trying to make an insane profit.<br \/><br \/>Edit to add......so apparently the pink one cannot be attached to the extra outlet. That outlet is for a different voltage but what the heck, I ordered it anyway. Can't go wrong with more than one hair removal system.

That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the \"quick fix\" trend so many other companies have.

First, the claim that it will stick to all tub or shower surfaces is a fallacy that most people who own fiberglass tubs and showers should know. If you have a slippery tile or enamel floor to your bathtub or shower you will be good to go. But who wants to have a slippery shower floor?<br \/><br \/>The second flaw is the curved piece that sits over the base.  If it had been designed properly, that piece would have been made from a bendable silicone so that if your foot hit it you wouldn't end up cursing a blue streak. But I am sure that was a money decision....easier to mold a one piece product than to have to assemble 2 pieces.<br \/><br \/>As for the pumace breaking, I don't feel the product is meant to stand on with your full weight.

Also love that it collapses to store.  I have thick curly hair (3A and 3B), and so i was excited to try this.  So far i am having two issues.  One, it tends to collapse to smaller size during use, esp when i get it closer to my head. Not sure that's a good thing.  Two, and this may be an issue of me not using it properly, it seems to make my hair too curly!  I like having the longer thicker big curls, rather than the tighter smaller and collier curls - and when i air dry, i usually have big thick curls.  But with this diffuser, i end up with smaller tighter curls, which is not exactly what i want.  As a result, my hair overall ends up looking another 2-3 inches shorter because the curls are tighter and smaller.  So if your hair is wavy and you want more curl definition, this might be great - but for me, going from curly to almost coils\/kinky is not a plus.  But on the plus side, it does give me good volume at the top of my head and the crown.","helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Two Stars","text":"Did not like product, but that is just me.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Nice throw n go unit","text":"Very cute.

I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br \/><br \/>Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft.

I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this.

I started using this as a total face cream and not just an eye cream. My skin really feels great after applying it. I use it at night before bed, only. I have very sensitive skin and have a tendency to break out with new products, but my skin has actually seemed to clear up lately. I'm not sure if it is due to this face cream or not, since it doesn't mention anything about acne, but it definitely has improved since using this. My skin never feels oily in the morning after using this, either. Overall, I really like this product, and will likely continue using it.

My skin burns easily so I didn't take any chances while there.  I applied and reapplied this sunscreen about every 2-3 hours.  I'm so glad I did.  I did not get burned while I was there, which by the way was spent almost entirely in the sun.  They say that only biodegradable sunscreen was allowed in Cancun, but absolutely nobody there asked us about the type of sunscreen we were using.  I wish I had known that, because otherwise I would've taken my regular sunscreen.  But this stuff did the job, so I was happy about that.  What I was not happy about was the amount of time it took to rub it into my skin.  It goes on white and stays that way until you rub it in and is absorbed.  I'm also not happy about the scent.  It wasn't bad, but I like a good Cocoa butter scent in my sunscreen\/tanning oils.  This one had more of a chemical smell.  I was also not too happy with the price.<br \/><br \/>Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.","helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Did not work","text":"I do not know what type of hair these would hold<br \/>My hair is coarse and straight<br \/>Really disappointed as they are lovely","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"The product works amazing!!","text":"First I want to say the three stars is for the product itself, which works great. Taking two stars off is for packaging, shipment, and customer service. So I ran out of nail polish remover not that long ago and have been looking for a better way to remove the nail polish with out all the chemicals. To my surprise I found this and was excited to try a all natural nail polish remover.  Made with all plant based ingredients which is a huge plus for me. I hate the way traditional nail polish remover smells and I hate using that stuff for my daughters nails. Now I feel comfortable using this with my daughter so she does not have to breath in those harsh fumes. I did not have any nail polish on at first so I put some on and let it dry. Once it was dry I put one to two drops on each nail then waited about 2 to 3 minutes. It wiped right off on all the nails except one small spot that came off with one more drop.<br \/><br \/>When this bottle arrived it was leaking all over the box. The seal was broken and the plastic wrapped around the lid was torn. So I had very little left in the bottle. I contacted the seller to let them know and to see about getting a replacement bottle. I took some time to get a response but they did respond. After the second email they sent a code for a replacement. That code did not work so I reached out to them again. They said it is on amazon and that the code has worked for others. I tried multiple times and the code did not work. So even if it is on amazon to supply correct codes, the seller needs to do their part in making the experience pleseant with the customer and this was not that.<br \/><br \/>Still pleased with the product itself though.<br \/><br \/>I received this free or reduced price for product testing and review.

The space at the top (after the first color) is not really a space...it is just a very light neutral color and because my skin is really pale right now, it's not very noticeable.

I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although \"cruelty free\" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br \/><br \/>The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter.  Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br \/><br \/>Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br \/><br \/>This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.","helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":5,"title":"Great with the Halloween display.","text":"Great with the Halloween display.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Such a beautiful fascinator but came totally flattened","text":"Such a beautiful fascinator but came totally flattened, and I still haven't been able to get it back to it's proper shape.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Two Stars","text":"cheap plastic made in China crap.Kinda works but not really.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Not my favorite","text":"I\u2019ve used the cucumber and lavender before and I didn\u2019t care for the smell so I tried this.

With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I\u2019ve been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products.

My unlucky streak continues.<br \/><br \/>The brush is, triangular shaped with the plastic bristles on one side. I think the brush shape does spread the lashes for the much desired &#34;butterfly&#34; shape. However, other qualities were not so successful.<br \/><br \/>This masacara  is very, very wet and blobs when you apply it. The way the brush is shaped makes it hold a lot of mascara. I have long-but-light lashes and I curled them before applying. I had to comb the (using little lash comb) to separate them and unstick them. Once separated I noticed a slight fan effect, but not noticeably different from when I use my favorite Maybelline  Full n Soft, which is a much dryer formula with a more traditional brush. Unlike previous L'Oreal mascaras it did stay on all day with no flaking.<br \/><br \/>So I gave it 3 stars for being waterproof and the unusual brush which may work better on different types of lashes. However I took off stars for its messy wet application. It was also a bit difficult to remove.<br \/><br \/>If you like a wet mascara, you'll probably like this one. However, I did not and won't buy again.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>It is waterproof.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>Difficult and blobby application<br \/>Sticks lashes together","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"creamy semi matte finish, bold, bright pop of color, fades w\/ drink & food, smudges","text":"Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word \"matte\" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br \/><br \/> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br \/><br \/>The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br \/><br \/>The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br \/><br \/>I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all.

There is nothing in this listing to warn you that this is not made with the same ingredients as Boudreaux's Butt Paste.

I was therefore really excited to try this product.<br \/><br \/>The product comes in this adorable little plastic container with a fun image of a cat on it. There is a small mirror on the inside of the lid. I appreciate that the container latches securely, so bits of loose powder don't get all over the place in my makeup bag. I would, however, appreciate if they found a way to fit a tiny applicator somewhere in the underside of the container. I had to dig one out from my makeup drawer.<br \/><br \/>This is an eyeshadow duo with a slightly pinker, and a more taupe-y shade. As you can see from the pic, these colors are very, very subtle on paler skin like mine. However, there is a nice shimmer to them that makes it stand out a bit.  I like that the eyeshadow is pretty clingy and didn't get all over my face when I was applying it. It is long-lasting--at the end of the work day, it still is quite noticeable when I look in the mirror.<br \/><br \/>Currently, the eyeshadow is retailing at about $22.

There is a lot of and it's thick, though not overly so. It came packaged with a cute flower garland headband and a lace stocking cap.<br \/><br \/>The wig cap itself is adjustable in the back, however, it doesn't have any hooks\/combs in the top or sides to secure it--not a problem, since it's easy enough to use a few strategically placed bobby pins. Also, if you have a large head or a lot of hair, getting this wig to fit might be too much of a struggle. (I had to braid my hair and wrap it a certain way around my scalp to get it flat enough to fit in this wig.) Finally, it's shiny to the point of looking synthetic--dry shampoo helped a great deal toward correcting that--and the part in the center is crazy wide.<br \/><br \/>Considering the price point, I would have awarded this wig the full five stars if those had been the only quibbles. However, it sheds like a Pomeranian and tangles like a kudzu. The shedding goes far beyond your typical wig shed--and you know it's a problem when you get up from a seat and see strands of hair clinging to the seat--and then there's the tangling which can't be undone with a quick pull-through with your fingers--I'm talking fairy knots galore.<br \/><br \/>Now, this isn't a bad wig, which is why I didn't go lower on the stars. In fact, it would be a great one-off or once-in-a-blue-moon cosplay or party wig.

It's not really, too thick, but it's also not crazy large like the Equigroomer is. I wanted to try this out before seeing if I should buy the equigroomer. OVERALL, impressed.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>-Dual blades, one for short hairs and one for medium-long hairs.<br \/>-EASY and reliable self-cleaning, retract the blades and easy to pull off the hair, also like how the hair (as long as you don't have a fan or a large gust of wind) stays on the surface of the comb. Making it easy to collect. and dispose of.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>-DOESN'T LOCK into position, so, I'd be mid combing my dogs and the blade would slowly crawl back inside and I'd only realize it since it would start to feel smooth, or there wasn't the expected resistance. SO you have to develop a combing method where your thumb sits behind the slider to keep the blades from retracting.<br \/>-CHUNKY, not bad for IN-HAND feel, but they made this out to be pocketable, it's not. I mean it is if you have baggy pants or cargo pockets. The thing is about 4x2x1 inches. It's that 1in thickness that kind of hurts the pocketability of this. THOUGH, if you're throwing this in a \"CARE\" bag like a pet version of a \"baby\" bag, then this isn't so bulky that it's going to greatly consume space.<br \/>-Cheap feeling, I know it's not expensive, but it does feel cheap. Like I don't know if this would survive a fall.<br \/>-Clogging- while I like that the simple act of retracting the blades pushes the hair out, don't know if the tolerance are there to prevent dander and dead skin from building up and clogging it.<br \/>-Questionable Shorthaired issues. I have one dog that is clearly medium haired, It's a dutch Shepherd lab mix; and the other is a foxhound catahoula. The foxhoud thinks the longer tooth blade is painful, but the shorter toothed blade is too short for it to be useful. The Dutch\/Lab dog has zero issue with the longer tooth comb.<br \/><br \/>Tip:<br \/>-NOW this might be just logical and common sense to some people, but it took me a while to realize. The best results come from using this product PERPENDICULAR _|_ to the body. I was doing a 45 degree angle and it wasn't catching as much. Also, go with the grain of hair growth not against.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion:<br \/>I think it's a great travel comb, and it's well worth the sticker price.

Ours both have very long, firm bristles top and bottom that are difficult to move back and forth through, and there are bristles completely surrounding the pumice stone so that you can't really get to it.  The pic on the box and the advertisements show no bristles at the back of the \"shoe\" behind the pumice stone, only in front of it, so that it's actually accessible.  The way these are made, the stone might as well not be there, because you can't use it. I'm not even sure it's an actual pumice stone after running my fingers over it--it feels artificial and has a different texture than pumice.  It's a good concept, and will at least take off surface dirt--if you can hang on to it.  I actually worry about it causing seniors to fall, instead of preventing it. I have to think there are different models; I looked online at the commercial and the plastic looks different and there are several colors, plus no bristles at the back.

It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to.

One of these keeps my hair up and out of the way without snagging or pulling.<br \/><br \/>The single pins, are also strong and flexible...just not very long. If you've got lots of thick curly hair as I do, it will take several strategically placed pins to keep things together.<br \/><br \/>Finally some of the single pins have a raised design that runs the full length of the too-short pin. The problem is that the raised design catches at my hair and pulls.  You might get the pin in, and enough of them to hold your hair up, but it may come loose, carrying part of your hair with it, making it harder to reinsert. Intentionally pulling these pins out is just as bad.<br \/><br \/>So if you are fine paying the total price for the double-tined pins in the collection, it's all good.

The carpet is a tight knurled dark pattern, and also a couple of area rugs that are low pile, and a wood floor. Eventually the vacuum started making noise after a week. Little tiny noises here and there that reminds you of a bearing that starts making noise on your car's serpentine belt pulley system. I'm a mechanic, so when I heard that noise I instantly knew it was a bearing in the spindle. Or time to get louder and louder and I had to replace it and I bought it Factory Direct. And then that was great and quiet for about a week, and then a few noises and trips here and there of the bearing. Obviously these bearings suck and they're letting dust inside of them or something. No other vacuum we've ever had in the last 25 years in this house has had a problem with the bearings going out on the spindles. And look how many reviews there are. Plenty of high reviews for people that are just glad to have a roller that made their $250 vacuum like brand new again instead of having to go and she'll of a couple hundred dollars more for another vacuum. But the sad truth of it, is that it is a low-quality part even though it is Factory Direct. This is the real deal. No second-hand plastic injection mold factory making knockoffs. It is the real deal.

I finally emptied the container, I'm finished and I wont ever use it again.<br \/>Unfortunately, I can not recommend this product, as it did not work for me.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>- Unscented<br \/>- Its Natural\/Aluminum-free Deodorant (As a former Peace Corps volunteer who completed my 27-month commitment, I really appreciate natural alternatives)<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-  I smelled. Unlike a reviewer who mentioned how they enjoyed letting their armpits breath and bask in the naturalness, I do not, and after about 5 hours my armpits smelled, which means I had to spend the last 3 hours at my office hoping and praying others could not smell me.<br \/><br \/>-  I hated applying\/pasting my armpit with deodorant like a savage. Using a small wooden stick to paste deodorant to your armpit feels wrong. After a while i got 'used' to it, but I never liked it.<br \/><br \/>-  I got small red rashes under my armpits. This may be due to the fact that my arms were rubbing together for the 1st time, as I had to trim my hair to get the deodorant to work for more than 2 hours.<br \/><br \/>-  Its expensive AND it only lasted ONE month. Normally, each rolling stick of Gillette\/OldSpice will last me at least 3 months....this is just not economical.....$11 for 3 ounces....is a very poor fiscal decision in my book.<br \/><br \/>Additions:<br \/>I really tried. I used the product until every last drop was gone. I wanted to see if my body just needed time to adjust. I noticed that the deodorant last maybe 2 hours with my little armpit hairs, so I shaved, not with a razor, with a trimmer, gave it a nice minimalist look. One month later I still smelled. Daily, I would rush home and use my Dr.Bonners to wash away the armpit funk. God forbid I actually worked up a sweat\/perspired from doing something that day, then I would almost immediately smell. It was not enjoyable.<br \/><br \/>Recommendations:<br \/>- Release a version for MEN (in my Ron Swanson voice)<br \/>- Eliminate the wooden stick, release a rolling stick version<br \/>- Release a larger size, for the same cost (Seriously.)<br \/><br \/>Disclaimer:<br \/>I live in NYC and walk 1\/2 block to the metro, 4 blocks to the office and back, five days a week...","helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Don't fall for the positive reviews by people who got free ones!","text":"So, I had a Clarsonic for 8 years.

One thing I can recommend is to section your hair and when curling, only curl a small section at a time because if you grab too much hair (I have a lot of hair and thick hair too), then it won\u2019t curl well. Another thing is, I can\u2019t guess how long to hold my hair on the wand before releasing so I\u2019m just guesstimating and pray I\u2019ve held it long enough to get the curl I want. I\u2019m too afraid of holding too long, damaging my hair. I purchased this item bc it was on sale for less than $19, saving me $20, so I figured I\u2019d give it a try.

Eyeshadow go's on smoothly over it, and I do think it helps it pop the color out. It's not tacky on your eyes like some. I would say it's better by itself, and to help making the application of eyeshadow easier, and help's shadow stand out. It does dry quick. The con's are, I can't really tell a difference in my eye makeup, or shadow lasting longer. &, I do still wish it came with more, because it doesn't last long at all. I only wear makeup once in a while, and I've already ordered another one, after 5 or 6 wears, and I probably have maybe, 5 or so wears left. Maybe!

I only had a couple minutes and was happy to discover it blends quickly and easily. I\u2019m fussy about makeup and don\u2019t like the look of anything too obvious. After initial application I used my hands to gently wipe away excess and help it melt into the skin, it made a big difference. As an aside, it was very difficult to wash off my hands so I suspect it won\u2019t transfer all over the place. It lives up to its name and imparts a lovely glow but doesn\u2019t look oily or greasy. So far I\u2019ve had it on for five hours and it still looks pretty good. I did spray my face with a bit of water and blotted with a tissue. That really smoothed the areas that we\u2019re looking a bit dry. I need to swap to a heavier winter moisturizer and and had done no skin prep prior to application. Given that I can\u2019t judge this too harshly.<br \/><br \/>As to the shade, it\u2019s not prefect but close. I wear Cream in Hourglass Vanish foundation. I think that makes me close to NW15-20 in MAC. I feel like the cool tone version of 21 would work better, but this one is neutral enough I can make it work. A lot of times neutrals lean too warm but this one doesn\u2019t seem too which means it\u2019ll work for more people. I think depth wise it\u2019s okay, but If you\u2019re at all darker than me get the next shade up.<br \/><br \/>At under $13 this is pretty incredible. It doesn\u2019t come with a refill, but given the price I\u2019m not going to complain. Please note if you\u2019re buying this only for the compact my AmorePacific cushion doesn\u2019t not fit in this at all. So if you use anything shaped like that it won\u2019t work. You could just swap the sponge with the actual product though.

So after the filter was on I was expecting to see some drastic change or at least see some blackheads on there. Again the only thing that got sucked up in here is my face skin! it will not glide across your face, which resulted in HUGE redlines from me truing to move it so that it didn't stay sucked in place and hicky my face all up.  with me fixing to be 30 its time I take care of my skin better & with all the hype about these I was really looking forward to this, but it HURTS & does not work for blackhead removal.... with that being said if this company decides to invest in the sext toy business this will be a top seller. the suction on this bad boy is what the ladies crave! but not on our face! lol","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"A little louder than I expected or like.","text":"I'm up and out early before the rest of the house and i would have preferred that this be a little quieter.

I like the deodorant because most \u201cnatural\u201d deodorants really irritate my sensitive skin where it\u2019s unbearable and anything that\u2019s aluminum based destroys my underarms. The formula of this is nice, I don\u2019t find it to clump in my underarm hair like other deodorants do. It goes on smooth and seems to absorb into my arm pits nicely.<br \/><br \/>Alright so here\u2019s the reasons I scored Lum\u00e9 Bay Rum so poorly:<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve been continuously disappointed because any scent that I like, they end up discontinuing. \ud83d\ude2d First it was Blue Spruce or Juniper something that then morphed into Juniper Breeze and then that just disappeared.<br \/><br \/>I was in a bind in June and Bay Rum was the fastest scent that could ship so I tried that one. I figured since it was so popular and has been around for a long time, that this scent was going to be incredible! My expectations were clearly set too high because WOW this stuff STANKS! It smelled like rotten eggs. I know I have an aversion to rum after a bad night at my friends wedding in 2015 but I thought I could put that in the past for the sake of my underarms. Unfortunately, this stuff really stunk and doesn\u2019t even smell like rum anything! Not even rum raisin ice cream or malibu or a beautiful fresh bay!<br \/><br \/>One thing I\u2019ve noticed since buying Lum\u00e9 from Amazon is that the consistency of each deodorant is never the same. Sometimes it\u2019s an oozing, soupy mess, other times it\u2019s a light fluffy consistency that\u2019s just perfect, then it also can come out like a gritty, frosting that struggled to exit the 3 little holes on the deodorant stick.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m a big guy and I sweat a lot and there\u2019s a lot of space to cover on my underarms, so I never have been confident in Lum\u00e9\u2019s 72-hour claim however I\u2019ve had success with about 24 hours (not with Bay Rum though). Right now I\u2019m using Tangerine and it\u2019s nice and lasts for a little bit\u2026 definitely not as long as the OG scents they discontinued, but I can make it through most of the summer day without smelling like a disgusting heap of trash!<br \/><br \/>Some of the other scents don\u2019t last that long on me, but when I put rotten egg smelling Bay Rum on me I really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m covered at all. I used this for a bit of June and had to throw it out because I couldn\u2019t even go a few hours without smelling stinky.  As a fat person, I\u2019m very aware of my size, my personal hygiene and of course how I smell.<br \/><br \/>Anyways, stay away from this gross scent - maybe I got a bad batch of it, but I\u2019m just scratching my head at how Amazon says this is the most popular scent.

It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br \/><br \/>After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me \u2013 she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish.

The flower (called a \"fascinator\" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br \/><br \/>The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br \/><br \/>I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br \/><br \/>Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower\/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower\/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Don\u2019t waste your money.","text":"Really poor design.

They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br \/><br \/>*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

That usually means I'm sitting down and listening to the TV while trying to make sure my makeup is as flawless as possible.  It helps tremendously to have a lighted mirror that has magnification so that I can make sure that my eyebrows are properly groomed and that I've managed to hide \/ blend any and all imperfections in my skin tone.  On the flip side, you ONLY get the magnification with this mirror so if you want the overall effect, you better stand WAY back or go to another mirror.<br \/><br \/>In order to utilize the lighted feature of this mirror, you need to install 3 AA batteries (not included).  The lighting is pretty awesome though and much better than the lighting I've experienced with another type of mirror.  The suction cup is a nice feature, although not one that I personally need to use.  This isn't a mirror that I will leave on my countertop and it's a very stable mirror so I don't see the need to suction it down.  I think the price of this mirror is very reasonable and I've paid more than this for similar products.<br \/><br \/>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The bottle is way too tiny, and being plus-sized, I used up the entire thing in one use. The spatula\/scraper they provide you with is microscopic compared to some. It took for-ev-er to get all the cream off with that thing. Near the end, I just gave up and rinsed some of it off without scraping. And you can\u2019t use most body washes after this? What\u2019s up with that? I usually like to do my hair removal creams before a shower, and I can\u2019t soap my legs?! And the hair inhibitor part did not absorb easily.

Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it\u2019s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br \/><br \/>Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don\u2019t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br \/><br \/>After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn\u2019t last long.<br \/><br \/>The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it\u2019s very strongly clove-scented.  It\u2019s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br \/><br \/>Overall it\u2019s a decent product but it\u2019s not really for me.  I just don\u2019t love the scent and it\u2019s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.  That is the one area I really liked and I would buy this if I found a scent I enjoyed.  The price is reasonable given that you get 6 bars.  I would say they last maybe 1\/3rd to 1\/4th of the length of most bar soaps and that might be a stretch.","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"They catch on the hair","text":"I do not recommend these because the fastener is not covered and hair gets caught in it","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Thumbs down.","text":"I returns this item.

We'll see how that works :-)  I wish I'd gotten the more solid, dark blond or light brown.  I purchased the 18&#34; extensions based on other reviews that said they are very thin at the bottom -- I wanted more thickness to my hair, not more length (although I would have been open to additional length if that worked out) and I wanted enough length that I could trim them, if needed.  I'm glad I did this -- I was able to cut off about 2&#34; of very wispy ends to match my own hair length.  When I clipped them in before cutting them to length, the wispy ends looked obvious and weird where they extended beyond my own hair length because there just wasn't enough hair at the ends to look right.  In any case, when I cut them to match my own hair length, they did exactly what I wanted -- I ended up with a nice thick braid.

When applied, it absorbs well into the skin and leaves my skin very soft and smooth.  Both of these products comes in large 4 oz jar and a little goes a long way. If you're looking for a great moisturizer and neck firming cream without spending too much money, this is a good choice.  Please note I purchased both the products at a discounted price for my honest review.","helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"Order a bigger size","text":"Little tight but good produt.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Not the best or worst lip exfoliator","text":"I like this product.

I've only used this product for three days and so far there is no irritation.  If you've never used a lash serum before, it is very easy to put on.  It's almost like applying clear eye liner.  Most lash serums suggest putting on before bed at night.  I can never remember when I go to bed, so I put mine on in the morning when I'm applying my makeup.  For me, this works fine.  I just let it dry for a minute and put my eye liner over it.  I have done that routine with this product and it has done fine.  As with the other ones I've tried, I will also be using it in my eye brows.  In three days I have not noticed a huge difference in the length (I have long lashes anyway), but I have also not noticed any irritation or loss of lashes like I've seen in some.

I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses.

This product is also good for vegans as it has no pesticides or other chemicals added to it.  So far I have only used it for a few days but I love how soft it makes my hair. This is an excellent moisturizer and helps prevent heat damage when I use my flat iron. I have been very impressed with the quality of this product but most importantly I need to know that the product I am using is pure and all natural.  Castor Oil has many uses and since you apply this to your hair or skin is is comforting to know you are not putting unwanted chemicals on your body.  I feel like all natural is the only way to go as you have no doubts as to what you are putting on your body or what your body is absorbing.

I\u2019m glad I got over it. I\u2019ve been using this and an older model I bought years ago and this one wins hands down. I don\u2019t really have acne. My issues are t-zone congestion and my skin\u2019s texture isn\u2019t smooth. I\u2019m in my mid 30s so I\u2019m trying to get on the anti-aging boat lol. I really like that this has a heat feature. However, It takes about 1 minute 30<br \/>seconds to heat up so I\u2019ll let it run and do something else. Wen it shuts off then I turn it on again and actually use it. Also the heat is mild. The device makes my skin super smooth and is gentle on the skin. I have combo\/normal skin and I can\u2019t stop touching my face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is still smooth. I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don\u2019t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn\u2019t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can\u2019t speak on it being waterproof.  I\u2019m thinking of purchasing another one for when the current one needs replacing. This device either has a 1 year warranty which is wonderful.

As much I love the almond coconut scent, I was looking for a bit of a change.  I read a lot of positive reviews of the amber vanilla scent, and I decided to try it.  While I'm not a huge fan of vanilla (well, I love it as a food, but not so much as a beauty product!), I absolutely love amber-scented products.  As I'm writing this review, I'm sniffing the cream, and trying to find the best way to describe the scent.  It's not difficult to pick out the individual amber and vanilla aromas; it's the combination of the two that I'm having a hard time describing.  As different as the two scents are, they mix well together.  The slightly masculine amber keeps the vanilla from being overly sweet.  I would say that the amber scent is the more pronounced of the two.  This a strong scent; if you're looking for something subtle, you may want to consider another scent.<br \/><br \/>The quality of Laura Mercier's cream is superb.  It's thick, rich, and absorbs well, without any greasiness.

It's that damn Giant nail drill written on it. ** If the product pictures are accurate, this seems to have been changed** It takes a tool that looks otherwise very professional and sleek and makes it look cheap and amateurish. (I painted over the writing and black and then matte top coated. I'll probably put a sticker on it anyway.) People in a professional setting, please stop referring to this as a drill! It just bolsters peoples fear of efiles, in addition to being completely inaccurate. The other con is that you have to turn the speed dial to turn off the file. A separate power button would be better, so that you could keep your RPM setting as is. This is especially cumbersome and time-consuming when you are switching directions. Turn the dial down to turn off the machine, hit the direction button turn the dial back up to whatever speed you need.

Maybe for a younger child who is able to be still and does not  move, then this product might work.  If your child has long hair, it would even be more difficult to put on. The other issue is that even if you put it on, then you have to still take off the hat and rinse off the section where the hat is, if you want to rinse off all the sample. The product is mailed directly from China, so it took a while to be delivered.<br \/>It seemed a good idea, but it just did not work at all.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Product packaging concerns","text":"The name \u201cHoney Bee Smooth Bath & Body Scrub + Moisturizer\u201d just evokes good thoughts, doesn\u2019t it? If you love honey, it just sounds amazing. I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br \/><br \/>There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I\u2019m not going to dispute that and it\u2019s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me \u2013 quality control especially.<br \/><br \/>The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I\u2019d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don\u2019t know and that doesn\u2019t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I\u2019m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be contaminated by anything else -1) it\u2019s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health\/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who\u2019s to say that someone couldn\u2019t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label \u2013 the one I mentioned with their website URL \u2013 if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br \/><br \/>\u201cThis webpage is not available<br \/><br \/>ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\u201d<br \/><br \/>I don\u2019t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br \/><br \/>ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product\u2026<br \/><br \/>When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary \u2014 the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it\u2019s honey, it\u2019s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br \/><br \/>It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn\u2019t expect that it wouldn\u2019t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good \u2013 I used it on my leg.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you\u2019re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br \/><br \/>I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4.

My skin runs fair to medium throughout the year so I can use 4 of the colors and the darker colors I just use for eye-shadow, usually in my crease as a blending color so nothing gets wasted. The banana color is great for brow bone highlighting. I love that the individual colors are magnetized and pop out so if you use a Z palatte (or a cheap dupe here; [[ASIN:B004SMPK6A ArtBin Sew-Lutions Slim Line Magnetic Box-Translucent Raspberry-6905AB]] you can pop whatever colors you use out and put in there instead of taking the whole palatte. It's nice to have the whole thing though because it has a nice big mirror. It also snaps closed so the lid isn't flopping around in your makeup bag and the powders getting gouged which I like a lot. I really have nothing but good things to say about this kit.

They're beautifully packaged and come factory sealed in plastic.  This night gel moisturizer contains hyluronic acid and dual peptides with chamomile, green tea and licorice extracts.  It's supposed to help repair and hydrate your skin overnight and stimulate collagen. There's a warning on the box that it may not be suitable for sensitive skin.  It comes comes with a pump dispenser.  It has a clean soap-like scent, a lot stronger than I like. Ideally, you would use Nano Botanix cleanser and toner before using the night gel.  The gel is more like a cream goes on smoothly and has a slightly drying effect and the smell lingers, which I don't like, especially when I'm going to bed.  I tried 4 Nano Botanix products and this is my least favorite.  I have normal-dry skin so this probably isn't something I'm going to use, but I think my daughter-in-law will like it.

Now to the actual review...)<br \/>Although this polish duo is bright and up to Orly's usual high standards, this is still a basic, high-color product. That factored with the cost earned my 3 stars.

It's applied regularly, no special effort needed to get the special effects. I normally paint my nails with color only, as this duo provides, with no fancy decorations and bedazzling, and this set is fine for that. Yet I did prefer the red star polish, which Amazon unfortunately seems to have already sold out.It left my nails looking comic-book cool, as if I'd just delivered a Wonder Woman POW! to some evil villain!

In fact, I still own it and it works just fine (although it now only holds a charge for about a week). I needed another trimmer for another location, and this one was the upgrade that was available. What a disappointment.<br \/><br \/>For one thing, it's really big. While the T860 was like a small South American banana, the T780 is like a big North American cucumber. Imagine trying to create an intricate drawing with a child's crayola instead of a pencil.<br \/><br \/>The extra size is apparently needed for the internal vacuum. This vacuum \"works\" in that it doesn't let hairs fall to the sink. But they become forever clogged inside the apparatus; you're never going to get them cleaned out, even after opening the flimsy plastic cover. The vacuum also adds to the noise. And my razor doesn't have a vacuum, so I'm going to have to clean up hairs anyway.<br \/><br \/>The extra girth and the vacuum outlet near the blades means that, as much as I try to cram the thing up under my nose, the blades can't reach the hairs at the top of my upper lip. I have to resort to using the (non-vacuuming) trimmer on my razor, or I'll have two or three long, uncut hairs just under my nose. And the retractable vacuum cover near the blades obscures the view and turns an agile row of blades into an unwieldy block of plastic.<br \/><br \/>The only benefit of this model is that the battery works well and it uses a nice color scheme.<br \/><br \/>I wish I knew where to buy another Norelco T860.<br \/><br \/>Update 2010-09-20: It turns out that the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philps Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is apparently the upgrade to the Norelco T860, renamed to a \"stubble trimmer\". Its form is seemingly identical to the T860 and, besides the black\/red color and the more grippable rubber coating on the handle, the only major changes seems to be a welcome battery upgrade from a NiCad to a NiMH. The QT4021 is just what I was looking for. I guess I'll drop off the T780 at my parents' house to use as a backup.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Good product","text":"best one so far","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","text":"These sponges clogged up my tub.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","text":"Love them!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Spectacular collection at this price point","text":"This is such a great deal- and perfect for travel.

However, I put it on other parts of my skin. It goes on a little oily but absorbs in really well.  It is an anti aging serum so I think I will continue to put it on my face and tops of my hands . ;) A few drops go a long way so this bottle should last for a while.

Other than that, it's terrible. I have naturally black hair and the instructions said that the bleach will turn my hair the accurate color in 1-2 hours. However, it took 5 hours to bleach a small strip of my hair to dye hot pink. 5 hours! And it still didn't bleach all the way. The product itself is horrible. Instructions state that if you leave the dye in for 30 minutes, your hair will remain vibrant pink for 4 months. However, this product washes out of my hair with every shampooing, leaving my pink highlight a nasty, neon orange color. You literally have to reapply the dye and complete the entire dying process over again after every wash. It's so time consuming and such a hassle. Though I know it's harming my hair, I resorted to combing the dye through onto my highlight and then straightening it with a flat iron to dry.<br \/><br \/>Will not be purchasing this product again and will definitely be looking for a new one.

I'm happy that this product works for all the 5- and 4-star reviewers. For me...meh.<br \/><br \/>For starters, this feels greasy on my skin and takes longer than other moisturizers to absorb. Certainly, it is an &#34;okay&#34; moisturizer, hence the three stars. (&#34;It's okay.&#34;) But for me, it's sure nothing to write home about.<br \/><br \/>I very much like the flip-top tube -- very quick and easy to open and dispense with one hand. The texture is nice. And I do appreciate the absence of scent. But an hour after I've applied it, my face feels no different than itI did before I put it on.<br \/><br \/>Having said that, I will say that I have researched the use and effects of ceramide on skin, and it does seem that, in certain strengths and when used with certain other ingredients, ceremides can help skin retain moisture. So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br \/><br \/>This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one. I can't recommend it as a great moisturizer, and I honestly don't know how it gets such terrific views, but that's the nature of skin care: what works for some doesn't work for others.

The toothbrush will do what you need to keep your teeth and gums in good shape without breaking the bank. The Essence does come with a 2 minute timer, which is a great feature at this price range.  The timer really helps you get all your teeth clean without spending too much time in one area.<br \/><br \/>The Airfloss is a nice way to help your gums if you are not fond of doing regular flossing.  Regular floss is the best way to go but if you are like me and are not good at doing that often, the Airfloss is a great way to go to help improve gum health.  I usually put in a fluoride mouthwash into the floss liquid reservoir and that works well.  I find it easy to move around my mouth with the Airfloss and I can complete the flossing very quickly.<br \/><br \/>For the price of this package, you get a good entry level Sonicare and the Airfloss, both will help with improving your teeth and gum health.  I have been using Sonicare for years and really like them as they improve my dental visits.

More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br \/><br \/>HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br \/>These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br \/><br \/>WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br \/>The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br \/><br \/>THE NAIL FILE<br \/>The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br \/><br \/>THE BOTTOM LINE<br \/>This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.

This stuff works! Literally works! My youngest loves to get her nails done all the time, whether it be at home done by her or myself, but mostly going to a salon. Just last week she went with her friend and got her nails done in cute but a little too light pink gel. The first couple of days she was ok with it, but then it grew old quickly. I told her to try this new remover I got. She opened it and when it didn't have the strong smell that acetone has, she said MOM I think you got the wrong stuff-no way will this take off gel polish. I kind of thought the same thing as this really doesn't have a bad or strong smell whatsoever. Plus it is oily compared to acetone remover. But we followed the directions using a cotton ball saturated and within 4 minutes, her polish was coming off easily. A little more applied and it was gone! Poof-just like that and the &#34;oil&#34; actually made her nails shiny and not slimy or oily and her cuticles looked like she had them soaked and cuticle cream applied. They literally felt softer-much, much better than when you use acetone! The oils in the remover are plant based and soak into the cuticle bed just as if you moisturized them. Great stuff! I was offered this at a discounted price for my review of the product. I am glad I got this-for under $13 you will get a big glass bottle of the remover and it should last you a very long time.

This brush is actually smaller than the small slicker brush that I already have. This brush is a good size for yorkies, but I bought this brush needing a LARGE slicker brush which is why I ordered large.. At first, I was under the impression that the wrong size was sent to me, but on the packaging for the brush, it said large. Not only is the size of the brush clearly not for large or even medium sized dogs, but the handle is absolutely tiny too! I'm not a big girl..

Be aware they are not made 316L Surgical Steel. If you're sensitive to metal, I'd stay away. They are externally threaded which I wouldn't recommend if your piercing is new. Internally threaded will cause less irritation. The dome shaped head can cause some irritation as well. I have found it really just depends on the ring. I've used several of them and about \u00be of them are fine but that \u00bc for some reason, the dome just scratches the roof of my mouth.<br \/><br \/>I also want to warn buyers the pictures shown, don't really give a good representation of what is sent.

This one is more efficient (faster, better shave) than my older one, and an amazingly amount quieter. What do you know- this time, &quot;new and improved&quot; really is accurate!<br \/>What I like: the shaver fits the hand well, the pivoting blade heads fit the face and as a result shave quite well. The battery strength indicator, consisting of bright LEDs showing the percentage of charge remaining in 20% increments, is very useful, and the flip-up hinged shaver head section is easy to clean with warm water (I still have to consciously force myself to do this!) They have also &quot;shrunk&quot; the half-egg shaped power transformer, and you can use 100 - 220 volts to plug \/ charge, a good thing for someone who travels globally as I do.<br \/>What I don't like: the pop-up trimmer is only fair - it works, but it's actually not as effective as the one on my old shaver! The deep well holding the head rotors shafts is not so easy to clean with a brush, particularly with the hinged head; they are still using a non-user replaceable NiCd battery; the gimmicky cutter head plate section with holes seems merely that - gimmicky, not useful for any real shaving.<br \/>Tips: After cleaning the head \/ blade assemblies, allow them to dry fully and spray-lubricate with something like &quot;Shaver Saver.&quot; When power seems low, turn the shaver on and allow to discharge fully before reccharging - these are, after all, still NiCd batteries with the &quot;memory&quot; effect. These tips have allowed my previous electrics' battery - and cutter head assemblies - to last a long time (I have a heavy beard - even with a blade shaver, I have to shave again in the afternoon if I have a dinner appointment.)<br \/>Recommendation: This is a very good, easy to use, quick and quiet electric shaver - the best I have ever used. It packs easily for travel, and though it is a bit finnicky to clean, I like it because it does the job I need it to do. Given the several deficits, I'd never give it four stars if not for how it handles its ultimate function - shaving my beard.","helpful_vote":26,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":5,"title":"Excellent AAAAAAAA ++++++++++++","text":"Excellent AAAAAAAA ++++++++++++","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Great Product","text":"My wife loves this product.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"There were not 240 beads in the package","text":"I purchased these beads to use in my classroom for my students to make bracelets representing the water cycle.

The primer and fixing spray I use work well for me (or at least are the best I've tried so far) and sweat is still an issue for me. When this came in, I had high hopes, but unfortunately this is not a miracle product. It did make my face feel tight, so I applied a small amount of moisturizer over it after letting it set but before applying my makeup. I'm a college student, so I walk to class all the time, and after a few classes I could tell that my face was fading and melting as usual. It wasn't a pretty sight. So the next day, to see if it was due to the moisturizer, I just applied the skin prep pro before my makeup. Sadly, I got the same results. I break it out every now and again to see if it's a certain product that it won't work with, but after going through all of my routine taking one product out at a time, I've determined that this just doesn't work for me.

So, I was interested to try the Philips PureRadiance brush.  First, the differences:<br \/><br \/>1.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.<br \/>2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.<br \/>3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.<br \/>4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.<br \/><br \/>The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It's not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you'll need to compare features.  If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"It is very pale","text":"I expected a darker purple.

I have been using this tool once per day at night for 7 days (I missed 1 day out of the 7 days) in combination with my normal nightly face routine. Prior to using the face tool, I apply a liberal amount of my eye cream so that there is still some that is not completely rubbed into my skin (the instructions recommend using an eye gel or similar product). I then use the wider, blunted tip on the tool and slowly move the tip around my face and pause in each area for about 5-10 seconds per the instruction manual.<br \/><br \/>The tool itself is about 6.5&quot; long and feels like a wide marker when held in your hand. It is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included) and has a power button with 2 intensity levels. When turned on, the tool emits bionic waves via the tool's tip when it makes contact with your skin (see demonstration in video). The lower wave intensity is supposed to be used for slight to moderate wrinkle reduction and the higher intensity is meant for deeper wrinkles. However, during my testing, I used the higher intensity level exclusively (all of my wrinkles looked deep to me lol). The instructions state that the tool can be used up to twice per day (with at least 6hrs between each treatment time) and should be used on clean skin. Treatments do not cause any pain\/discomfort and do not leave any marks or redness on your face.<br \/><br \/>This wrinkle eraser is incredibly easy to use, though does take some time dedication if you follow the recommended 5-10sec per skin surface area. I have already begun to see results (thanks to remembering to take &quot;before&quot; pictures) and will 110% continue to use this tool indefinitely. Now that I know the tool works, I'm going to start using the smaller tip on the wrinkles just under my lash lines in addition to using the broader tip around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing more results, and I would highly recommend this product to others.<br \/><br \/>*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br \/><br \/>It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br \/><br \/>I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this \u2018poo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if\/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br \/><br \/>My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br \/><br \/>DARK HAIR option: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B084JCXT18<br \/><br \/>PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too.

Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until you see fine powder particles falling onto your hair. 4. Using a makeup brush or your fingertips, massage your shampoo into your scalp. Brush as usual, or (for extra body), use your fingertips to massage the shampoo into your hairline.","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"3 different colors.. could only use 1 color","text":"3 different colors.. could only use 1 color","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Just looks like a regular silver polish","text":"Top coat dulls the chrome.

I wasn't sure what it was all for, so I actually went to read the instructions. The only instructions that came with the kit were on the bag containing the \"purple things\" which said something about using a brush. A brush wasn't included in the kit, or in the description of the product ( in fact, it says that \"no brush is needed\" in the product description.)<br \/><br \/>A this point, I am thinking that perhaps you \"may\" use a brush, but that the kit is really for the eyebrow stamper (which IS included). One side note: I have the \"expensive\" version of the eyebrow stamper kit, and I like it, but none of the eyebrow shapes easily fit my eyebrows, so I was looking for more variety in shapes. Okay, that said, there are tons of eyebrow shapes in this kit. So bonus for that. But back to how to use it and how do the shapes fit in with the purple things?<br \/><br \/>So now I am still trying to wing it, so I put the tiny cord into one of the purple things and think \"maybe\" you slide the eyebrow shapes behind the purple thing. Besides the fact that the cord was SO TIGHT I couldn't think straight, even after 5 minutes of fiddling with the shapes to get them inside the purple thing and lined up, I go to stamp it with the stamper - and no go. The purple things block the stamper rendering the shapes useless.<br \/><br \/>At this point, I go to the internet to search for the solution, and some kind soul had posted a video using the purple things! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc However, she was not using any forms at all - just the purple mask things and a brush and some eyebrow powder to fill in the mask-things.<br \/><br \/>So, I am finally getting that the purple things are something totally unrelated to the eyebrow stamp that I bought the kit for and I go ahead and use the shapes and the stamp just like the more expensive brand. The eyebrow shapes are much, much flimsier than the \"expensive\" brand, which actually might be better. Not better for cleaning, but better for trying to hold in place while you work your other arm around with the stamper.<br \/><br \/>In the end, I thought that the stamper worked just fine, and I liked the variety of shapes which actually enabled me to find a shape closer to my own eyebrows. I'm not a creamy\/stick eyeshadow gal, but they were nice colors for those that are. I haven't tried the eyebrow \"soap\" yet either, but I probably will. Heck, I may even try the purple things eventually just to see if it's easier than the stamp.

I bought this product to try to deal with the sun damaged skin on the backs of my hands. Many brown spots (from too much sun exposure), wrinkles, dry skin, and crepe like skin. I did get some filler in my hands as they were starting to look like skeletons, and that made them look years younger, but the skin still needed a lot of help. I couldn't wait for the bottle to arrive so I could read the ingredients and I wasn't let down: Organic Aloe Vera, Cucumber Distillate, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Organic Sunflower Oil, Tamanu Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Flax Seed Oil, Organic Evening Primrose Oil, Organic Rosehip Oil, Vitamin B5, Wildcrafted Arnica, Organic Lavender, Organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Macadamia Nut Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Glycolic Acid( to give a very slight peel with each application), Organic Coconut Oil, Squalane, Palm Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Organic Beeswax, Organic Jojoba Oil, Coenzyme Q10, Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Grapeseed Oil, Wildcrafted Oregon Grape, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Camellia Oil, Avocado Oil, Wildcrafted Eyebright, Helichrysum Essential Oil, Organic Licorice, Lemongrass, Vitamin C Palmitate, Tocopheryl (Antioxidant), Pyrus Malus, Citrus Medica Lemon, and Sugar Cane. WOW! I was more than impressed. I started by using my Clarisonic on the backs of my hands with a gentle cleanser and patting them dry and applying a small drop of this moisturizer to each hand while it was still moist.The first result I noticed was around days 3-5 yhe dryness was just about disappearing, my skin was soft and smooth. Brown spots took a bit longer, about 2 weeks, to really start to fade, but that is probably because the skin on your hands is so different from your face, and these were some bad brown spots. The wrinkles were the last to respond. While I could see mild improvement at 2 weeks, it took 4 weeks to see significant results.

I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy,\u00a0I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro \"lift proof\" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br \/><br \/>First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br \/><br \/>I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail\u00a0form\u00a0attachment\u00a0things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars \u2728 for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times.

While my heels haven\u2019t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It\u2019s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven\u2019t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br \/><br \/>This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a \u201cbite\u201d to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br \/><br \/>The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br \/><br \/>I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don\u2019t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress \u2013 my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br \/><br \/>After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they\u2019re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br \/><br \/>I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br \/><br \/>This thing really works and it does a good job. It\u2019s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Works okay but smells... odd?","text":"It\u2019s spritzes on pretty well.

First of all, it doesn't suffer from the two major issues most cheap nail drills face: lack of torque and internal wobbling. A lack of torque is when the rotation mechanism stalls out if you press hard enough against the nail. You'll know a nail drill has internal wobbling because it will almost tickle or feel uncomfortable when you file your nails.<br \/><br \/>With that being said, here's what I don't like: I prefer much thinner nail drills. Even if you \"choke up\" your grip onto the thinner part of the drill it's still thick enough to make my hands tired if I'm using it for longer than a few minutes. I can't imagine this being comfortable to use all day in a nail salon. Next, the instructions. It took me way too long to figure out how to change the drill bit, partly due to the vague instructions and partly because I had to use so much force I genuinely thought I was going to break it. The twist mechanism is misleading. You turn it and it stops so you think you're done turning it but in actuality you have to keep turning it until you hear a click.<br \/>It also would be nice for the manufacturer to explain the differences between all the drill bits and what the intended use case is for each one.<br \/><br \/>FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN'T CHANGE THE DRILL BIT:<br \/><br \/>Turn the top portion of the drill toward the side labeled \"R\" until you hear a click (this is important) use pliers and pull out the drill bit. You'll need to use more force than you think.<br \/>Once you've removed the drill bit, stop turning the top portion of the drill toward \"R\". The mechanism will go back to the center by itself. Pick your desired drill bit and put it where the old drill bit was. Turn the top portion of the drill towards the labeled \"S\" until you hear a click to secure the drill bit (The drill bit WILL fall out if you don't twist it towards \"S\" until you hear a click).","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":5,"title":"Perfect for tight space on marble subway tile in bathroom (not in shower)","text":"I did not purchase this on Amazon, but purchased at a local store because I wanted to physically view it first.

This is my children's bathroom and I wanted to give them a mirror to help them with brushing their teeth.  I needed something small that did not require nailing or gluing and that would not break and hurt my children if it fell off.  This item pretty much perfectly fit the bill.  My one worry was that it would not actually stick to the slightly uneven marble tile surface.  I was also a little worried that the image would be warped and ultimately unhelpful.  I have had this now for about a year and it has held up beautifully.  It fits in the space perfectly, has a nice modern and clean look that blends into the slightly grey tone of my marble tile and most importantly, stuck without any problems (make sure to stick to clean DRY surface), even with small fingers poking at it.

The bottle is filled with tiny \"pearls\" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br \/><br \/>Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all.

I kept the larger ones since they work well for foundation, bronzer, blush, etc. and kept one of the smaller brushes for lip color but the others left a lot to be desired.

All have their advantages and disadvantages. My favorite is now the Nidra mask, but it has an important flaw.<br \/><br \/>I sleep from after midnight until 8am, and my bedroom is bright. Therefore, I need a mask that will stay on for seven or eight hours. If it shifts when I move during the night, it will not be covering my eyes when the sun comes up.<br \/><br \/>Although I used it for several years, the Earth Therapeutics mask does the worst job of staying in place all night. I think this is because it does not have as much shape or structure as the other two masks. Also, it presses on your eyes, making it a bit less comfortable than the other two masks. I no longer use this mask.<br \/><br \/>The Nidra mask does the best job of staying in place. It is also slightly larger than the Bedtime Bliss mask, and feels a bit more comfortable. However, the Nidra has a flaw: Although they all have the same length band, the elastic on the Nidra band has a bit more tension than the Bedtime Bliss or the Earth Therapeutics masks, which means that it is too tight on my fat head. I have actually had to extend the strap with a piece of dual-sided velcro strap in order to make it comfortable. Now it fits the best and stays in place better than the other two masks.<br \/><br \/>The Nidra mask is about 3\/4 inch or 2cm wider across the eyes than the Bedtime Bliss mask. If you have a small or narrow face, you may want to try the Bedtime Bliss mask first<br \/><br \/>As far as light blocking and comfort go, both the Nidra and the Bedtime Bliss do a good job. Therefore, my choice is the Nidra because it stays on better after I make the strap longer.<br \/><br \/>Summary: I have stopped using the Earth Therapeutics mask. The Bedtime Bliss and Nidra are very similar, but the Nidra fits me better and stays in place longer. If you have a large head like me, the Nidra mask will be tight. If you have a small or narrow face, try Bedtime Bliss.","helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Doesn't work.","text":"Doesn't work.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Not worth the hassle","text":"Hair is soft but doesn't work as advertised","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Dull","text":"First, do not be deceived by the size of the comb used in the pictures.

However the claim that it stops sweating doesn\u2019t really hold true.  While applying my make up, as I sprayed it on a bit somehow hit my lip and part of tongue which instantly felt like the desert and tasted like I licked a deodorant stick lol.  So I thought all would go to plan.  And it did a great job of making my skin feel normal but keeping me from sweating during make up application and up until I got to the show and it was extremely hot and humid.  I don\u2019t feel like I was sweating any less than would be normal and I was having to pat myself down with a towel constantly when I wasn\u2019t onstage.  Also of note, the setting spray is meant to be cooling, which all setting sprays are, but is also meant to almost eliminate sweating.  I reapplied the setting spray several times just to cool off.  Still. Even though in was in the extreme heat and humidity of South Florida, where I wouldn\u2019t expect anything to really stop sweating, I didn\u2019t feel like my face was sweating any less than it would have been with nothing on my face.  HOWEVER\u2026 at the end of the night, despite sweating and blotting with a towel constantly, I was the only cast member who didn\u2019t look a mess.  It definitely worked far beyond what I think setting spray alone would have done.  I\u2019ve never used the mehron setting spray that but I\u2019ve never had a setting spray of any brand work to THAT degree.  Stage make up is heavy and it still looked pretty great.  After removing my make up, my skin wasn\u2019t at all dry either.  I don\u2019t know how moisturizing it was but for a product that\u2019s meant to be an antiperspirant, it was definitely not drying in the least.  So I don\u2019t feel like it actually inhibits sweating.  However it\u2019s an impressive primer and for stage make up nothing has ever worked better for me.  I have to keep in mind that I was also using mehron\u2019s setting spray which I say the same about.  Didn\u2019t affect sweating.

So, that was a bust.<br \/><br \/>I asked them to just send me two working twist top lids as the bottles were fine and returning them would be as hassle at this point since 2 have stuff in them even though I van only one properly... They did a song and a dance and wanted me to jump through hoops just to get some lids for their defective item that I could have just rated lowly and returned.<br \/><br \/>So, I'm changing my rating.

AND an iPhone 6 (Work Phone), AND a Galaxy Tab4 10.1, AND a New Trent Battery 12,000 mAh Pack.  With that said, each one of these devices is using it's own charger and because of that, I had to resort using a power strip by my bedside JUST to charge all my devices.<br \/><br \/>The current chargers I use are all stock (1 Apple Charger, 3 Samsung Chargers).  One of the Samsung Chargers is directly from the S6 Edge Plus (supports Adaptive Fast Charging\/Quick Charge 2.0), yet it fails to work 80% of the time on my S6 Edge Plus for whatever reason...<br \/><br \/>Another issue is when I go away for overnight trips somewhere.  For a day, I could probably just get by with just the iPhone charger & Samsung charger, but when I have 3-4 night stays due to work, I have to pack all of them!!!  It's just a big hassle.  That's when I decided I'm just going to resort to buying a GOOD multi-port charger.  I've used Ankur devices in the past and I've been very pleased with all of them.  After reading various reviews, I decided the 3-port is perfect for my situation.<br \/><br \/>For $25, you get a 3-port charger: 2 PowerIQ ports and 1 Quick Charge 2.0 port (which the Edge+ takes advantage of).<br \/><br \/>I've used the Ankur PowerIQ tech before via an Ankur Car Charger and I can definitely say it's almost as good as the Quick Charge 2.0 technology.  What I like about it is that it supposedly &#34;detects&#34; what kind of device is connected to it and charges accordingly.  Whether this is true or snake oil, I can say that it charges my devices fast and never has any kind of power dip when you have multiple devices connected to it.  I use these two ports for my iPhone, Galaxy Tab4 and New Trent Battery pack.<br \/><br \/>The single Quick Charge is dedicated to my Galaxy S6 phone and right out of the box (same cables and all), it would fast charge my phone 100% of the time.  Unlike my old stock Quick Charge Charger, it never seemed to work.  So when I'm charging my phone and seeing it will fully charge within an hour makes me happy!<br \/><br \/>The only initial turnoff is the $25 sticker price.  Yes you get a multi-port charger, but I think maybe that sticker price will scare some people.  But after experiencing and using this product, I think that $25 is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Never have a poor quality\/flaky charger again.

(Verses the rectangular shape of the previous toothbrush head on last Sonicare toothbrush).<br \/><br \/>2)The neck of this toothbrush is angled forward, which makes it easier to position the toothbrush for optimal cleaning.<br \/><br \/>3) I also wear braces and really feel that the shape of this toothbrush head cleans thoroughly between the brackets and wire. Even if I didn't wear braces, I feel this toothbrush gives a cleaning. So recommend this toothbrush for people who don't wear braces as well.<br \/><br \/>4) Strong brushing action of toothbrush head is great too for cleaning teeth.<br \/><br \/>5) No need to have a toothbrush charger! Instead all you need to do is replace two AA batteries (battery life approximately 6 weeks) and you are ready to go!<br \/><br \/>Besides, who really wants to wait several hours for their toothbrush to be fully charged once the toothbrush loses it power. Also no need to carry a charger with you when you travel.<br \/><br \/>6) Great price for $39.99!","helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"Works good","text":"Took some time to get used to.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Great tint for eyebrows","text":"Wow is this easy to use!

It was pretty strong, and ever-present. I was like, \"hmmm, not bad, but also not sure if I want to smell like this to others\". Didn't take long at all before I pretty much hated the scent. It's very 'cedar' like, I guess you could say. Sort of like you are sticking your nose right into a bag of cedar wood chips. At least that's what it smelled like to me.<br \/><br \/>The Balm:<br \/>This is pretty much just greasy. Feels and smells mostly like you're just rubbing Vaseline on your beard, though a bit lighter.<br \/><br \/>The package:<br \/>The presentation is actually really nice. Nice little velvet bag with a string, the balm\/oil, and even a guitar pick.<br \/><br \/>The result:<br \/>Yes, my beard felt a *little* softer, and was a *little* less frazzled looking, though not much more than if I just comb it after a shower. I'm not really sure why I'm seeing so many RAVE reviews; it's not *that* great. I can take it or leave it.<br \/><br \/>The price:<br \/>Here's probably the bigger issue; it's around $6 for this trial, and you really only get about 1, maybe 1.5 uses out of the teeny tiny sample of oil (see pic). I actually feel like I got a little bit ripped off on the price for the amount you get. I'd like to see the trial priced more around the 3\/4 dollar mark in total (incl. shipping, et. al.). I'd like to try some different scents, but there's not a chance in Hell I'm paying that amount again for even 1 more sample for that amount of oil, and there're a whole lot of scents to try before you find one that you might like. On the other hand, I saw they offer a trial package of all scents (the same tiny sized bottles), which is cool, but it's $30+ .... no thanks. Drop it to around $10 total and I'll try it. I'd also like to see them offer that same package, minus everything but the oils (no balms, etc.), just to see which scent I like, and make it around say $5 total.<br \/><br \/>All-in-all:<br \/>It's \"ok\". If I could find the scent that I like w\/out dropping a fortune in the process, I'd probably buy the big bottle of it, or even bottle(S) if I found more than 1 scent I liked; possibly regularly.

I like the gel rests the best because they are the most comfortable and durable. I can sanitize them better than any other rests I've used. The problems I've had with most of the gel neck rests, is they are only good until they get wet, then they slip off. I've tried the gel rests with the built in suction cups before. They are better than the ones without, but they eventually give way when wet as well. The major pro with this item is the suction cups are made of material that are not gel. They adhere terrifically. They are built around the gel and attached that way. I'm assuming one would want to keep that area dry in between uses so it doesn't eventually break down there.<br \/>The only problem I have is the single cup does not reach to the outside under the sink. Not sure if my sink has too thick of a rest? Either way, it is not made for universal use. Nevertheless, it still stays on, the single one just stays un attached. It does get caught on the chair sometimes if I am not careful when I bring the client up from the bowl.

Years ago if I lost a screw I'd go to the local drugstore and buy one of the little combo screwdriver, magnifying glass, that came with about a 1\/2 doze screws. I don't ever remember those screws not fitting whatever glasses\/sunglasses I tried to fix.<br \/><br \/>I looked at a lot of kits that had dozens or hundreds of screws of varying sizes. I read through reviews and even with the huge selections and &#34;variety&#34; of screws there was a surprising number of people who complained that none of the screws fit their glasses.  I decided to steer clear of those and settled on this kit because of the variety of other items included.<br \/><br \/> However, after pulling out my magnifying glass I tried each screw size one by one and none fit.  Two were too large and one was too small.<br \/><br \/>Since the smallest went through the hole I decided to try using one of the nuts that came with the kit. First, I couldn't tell what fit with what because there is no guide. Second, after trying the nuts on the smallest screw I found they didn't fit.<br \/><br \/>I finally just stripped a piece of copper wire from some speaker wire I have laying around and threaded it through the hole in the glasses and tightened it down.  So, at least I have something that will hold until my eye appointment and I don't have to worry about the lens popping out.<br \/><br \/>I'm keeping the kit.  I'll probably just pick up a few screws from the optomitrist once he lets me know what size I need and replace the ones that are in the kit so it's not  a complete loss. I'm not sure when, or if I'll need the other items that come in the kit.  Also, there are things that came with it that I have no idea what they are for.

Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars\u2b50","text":"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me\u00a0to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br \/>It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br \/>I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great\u00a0while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br \/>I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces,\u00a0put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br \/>I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These\u00a0are definitely on my must-have list.

I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br \/><br \/>I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new \"Simply Radiant\" skin care system with fancy \"Soy Proteins\" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br \/><br \/>I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch \"shine\" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.<br \/><br \/>I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!","helpful_vote":15,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"Beware, it may overheat!","text":"I used about 10-12 times and it was working beautifully, one day it just overheated and melted the plastic bristles and I didn\u2019t notice and felt very hot on my face, luckily I didn\u2019t burn myself.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Not the right colors","text":"NOT the colors that the pictures show!","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Great price","text":"Great thanks!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"The Leaking Water Flosser","text":"Good Points-good power -light weight- Bad Points-Hard to plug in for charge & hard to remove the cord after charge-After flossing, no matter how much  you wipe the unit off, the tank leaks!

I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and\/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing.

It lathers well and seems to be more moisturizing than most soaps.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Heavily fragranced, but does have a brightening effect","text":"Overall, I liked this sheet mask but I would not buy it again because it was so heavily fragranced that I couldn\u2019t bear it for more than 5 minutes. This mask is the first mask I\u2019ve seen which contains kaolin clay. You leave the mask on like any other sheet mask, but after you take off the mask, you can see a thin layer of gray clay on your face. You have to rinse that off.  After I rinsed off the mask and applied my usual Cerave cream moisturizing cream, I felt that my skin looked noticeably brighter.<br \/><br \/>These masks are expensive. They cost $6.00 each (a pack of 5 costs $30.00 on Amazon). Although the two-piece mask fit my face, did not slide off, and is the only sheet mask I know which incorporates kaolin, I found the floral, perfume fragrance overwhelming. A sheet mask should be enjoyable and not make you want to hold your breath.<br \/><br \/>Instead of buying this mask again, I want to try clay\/kaolin\/bentonite masks and continue to use masks with some of the same ingredients as this mask (e.g., niacinamide (brightens skin but can be irritating for some people), allantoin (soothing), centella asiatica extract (soothing), and dipotassium glycyrrhizate (potential brightening effect)).<br \/><br \/>ALTERNATIVE CLAY MASK: I highly recommend the ISNTREE Real Mugwort Clay Mask* ($23.60 for 3.38 fl oz). There is a strong earthy, herbal scent when you apply the mask, but it disappears quickly. I noticed decreased redness using this mask. It has been more effective than any sheet mask I have tried.<br \/><br \/>ALTERNATIVE SHEET MASKS: To brighten skin, try Keana Nadeshiko Rice Mask 10 Pieces Japan** (10 sheets for $9.50). The fragrance free masks contain glycerin (moisturizing), rice ferment filtrate (sake) and rice bran for a skin brightening effect.<br \/><br \/>* https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blackheads-Whiteheads-Moisturizing-Sensitive-Extracts\/dp\/B07KQYWBP7\/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3BHFM1SJVHDQD&keywords=innisfree+clay+mask&qid=1656954243&sprefix=innisfree+clay+mask%2Caps%2C43&sr=8-7<br \/><br \/>** https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Keana-Nadeshiko-Rice-Pieces-Japan\/dp\/B018FM03CO\/ref=psdc_11061121_t1_B00IFROMCM<br \/><br \/>Thank you very much for reading my review.

This Age Renewal Serum comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $120 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br \/><br \/>This particular one is filled with phytobiotics stem cells, botanical hyaluronic acid, retinol, Vitamins and various herbs. Keep in mind, whenever you use retinol to use sun blocker since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to sun light. This particular blend is supposed to help protect your skin against environmental stressors and resulting in youthful looking skin while hydrating it. When you use this you will notice this serum it has the most pleasant fragrance of the 4 that I have and is actually pleasant and not as reminiscent of an essential oil as the others are.<br \/><br \/>It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin. When I use this my skin feels nice and soft, very smooth and definitely looks beautifully hydrated, thanks hyaluronic acid.  Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that also have hyaluronic acid that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this serum.

The item is made of durable, quality material, and I can see it holding up for years to come. The price compared to other purse organizers is much more economical and I like that it has a bottom-it makes switching purses much faster than if I had to fish out the organizer and then move my loose items.<br \/><br \/>A concern listed in a couple of the other reviews is that the organizers smell-I did not encounter that at all, and I'm very sensitive to smells. The smaller organizer fits into my standard size purses and really does help keep me organized. I wish some of the pockets were of a different size, but overall the organizer fits my needs and I'm very, very glad I took a chance on this item.<br \/><br \/>I bought it through Amazon instead of the TV offer so I didn't have to worry about sneaky S&H charges etc, and as a minimalist, I only need one set, not two, and I certainly didn't need their \"special bonus gift\".","helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Good Quality.

I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br \/><br \/>The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br \/><br \/>The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br \/><br \/>I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br \/><br \/>The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br \/><br \/>The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat. Usually, to counterbalance this I place one of my arms over the heating mask to apply weight and increase the intensity of the heat.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Not bad but you have to use it on just washed ...","text":"Not bad but you have to use it on just washed hair or it won't go through it at least on mine it won't!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Four Stars","text":"Good","helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Not a good buy...save up and get a better one!","text":"Not much suction and it's loud!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"You had one job...","text":"The two neck fasteners are sewn on facing down.

Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br \/><br \/>CHARGING<br \/>Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br \/><br \/>CONTROL PANEL<br \/>The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br \/><br \/>SETTING<br \/>Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br \/><br \/>CURLING<br \/>This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br \/><br \/>JAM<br \/>When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br \/><br \/>Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br \/><br \/>TIMER<br \/>One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br \/><br \/>THE BOTTOM LINE<br \/>This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br \/><br \/>MY RATING<br \/>FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.

Shaving and I have never been friends.  I usually can only use a Mach III blade 2 times (3 times max) before I have to throw it away, else it turns my face into blood salad.<br \/><br \/>As such, electric shavers have never done that good of a job on my face.  I always use an electric shaver first to get the big chunks of hair off so that the Mach III can go in for precision, but in no way shape or form can I use an electric shaver alone and then go out into public.  This is especially true of the neck area.<br \/><br \/>For years, I've been using the Norelco line of shavers (most recently the 3000) as my choice.  The three-circle-blades-in-a-triangle works best for me, especially on that stubborn neck area.  It isn't necessarily the closest shave, but it does get the most hair removed overall.  And its usable in the shower.<br \/><br \/>Enter this Wahl shaver.  Right out the gate, I'll say that on the parts it does shave properly (flat open areas like sideburns), it cuts super close.  It also charges very quickly, behaves well in the shower, and is easy to clean.  But that doesn't really set it apart, since many shavers also do this.  I like the carry bag it comes with.<br \/><br \/>What I don't like is that it does REALLY bad work on the curved parts of the face such as the aforementioned neck area.  In fact, it's almost useless there.  I had to clean up with the Norelco after using the Wahl, and I did several test runs.  The Wahl performed a little bitter with shaving cream, but then again, so does the Norelco.<br \/><br \/>Maybe if your face isn't gnarly and coarse like mine, this Wahl is for you.

First off, it took FIVEver to expression the gel out. I think I clicked the bottom 50 times before a tiny bead of gel started to appear, I had to aggressively click and slam the pen onto the counter to get more product out. Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn\u2019t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there\u2019s a mild taste to it.  So far I\u2019ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I\u2019ve seen a tiny bit of results. You\u2019re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven\u2019t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I\u2019ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity. Other good ingredients include xylitol and natural antioxidants. Overall good product, just need a better way to get the product out without having to click it.

The size is right and the spread in the tines is great. The material seems nice, although the carbon fiber is not all that discernible from quality plastic as far as look and feel. All in all I like this comb quite a bit; however, I admit that I slightly prefer my Kent comb. After going back and forth, I believe this is mostly due to fact that the glossier, and slightly more compliant Kent gildes more smoothly.

Another reason why I won't buy them again is that it's difficult to get just one wipe at a time out of the container.  The first time I opened it, a clump of wipes came out and I had to squeeze them back in again. It's tricky getting just one wipe out at a time.

Ok I've had luck with a couple mud masks on here and one of those I really liked but,... I can only use the one I really loved every couple of months because it has peel like ingredients and that's not the type of mask to use weekly or bi weekly . This type of mask could be used at least weekly without harsh affects. I was definitely skeptical about the smaller pores claim but it's true !!!! I had my daughter do a video on her iPod and even though it wasn't really noticeable in the mirror afterwards to me at least, on the video the larger pores I have were actually smaller. I cannot figure out how to upload a video from anything other then my iPad so later this week I'm going to get a video or pictures on my iPad so I can post the difference. It's crazy how a mud can do this much without me noticing any major intenseness that I get from my other favorite mud mask, so pretty much I'm getting results without the burning, oh and this is also WAY more then what I get in the jar of my other stuff. So a. It's more, b. It's more affordable, c. It's easier on my skin and yeah you get the picture,. This is definitely the best mud mask you can get for the money and it really shrinks your pores, or my pores at least. My combination skin feels good and &#34;normal&#34; for two to three days after. Now that might not be a lot to you, but for me it's a miracle because usually by day two I'm oily on my problem areas and that's not fun. I highly recommend this mask to anyone looking for an affordable mask that'll last a long time, meaning it's not a ridiculously small jar.I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me.

I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br \/><br \/>This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br \/><br \/>Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br \/><br \/>The overall look of the brushes is very nice. I love all things girly & nail brushes rarely fail me in the girly options that are floating around on amazon.<br \/><br \/>So far my absolute favorite nail brush (that I use for watercolor) is a 100% Kolinsky Sable Round Nail Brush.

Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br \/><br \/>\ud83d\udc31For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br \/><br \/>Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br \/><br \/>Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br \/><br \/>\ud83d\udc30I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br \/><br \/>\ud83d\udc30Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br \/><br \/>\ud83d\udc07Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased\/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br \/>\ud83c\udf10 https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001NLVFH2<br \/>\ud83d\udc07I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br \/>\ud83c\udf10 https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00GU7NKWW<br \/><br \/>Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure. So far I like all three.<br \/><br \/>Chris Christensen: Made in Germany $75.99<br \/>https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/\/B00KAJTPZ2<br \/><br \/>We Love Doodles: Made in USA $29.99<br \/>https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B09G981NXV<br \/><br \/>Rita's: Made in China $36.99","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":2,"title":"Great Size but a Runny Mess","text":"I like the size and concept, but the lotion was very runny and not the best quality.

It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.<br \/><br \/>There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.<br \/><br \/>But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"who has bad nicotine stains on his lower teeth","text":"It didn't work for my 74 year- old husband,who has bad nicotine stains on his lower teeth.<br \/>We were disappointed!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Nice and soft","text":"Great product, glad I found them here.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"I like them","text":"Strong and sturdy, nice weight.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Just as described","text":"I suffer from dry skin and usually soak my feet nightly.

It has three buttons in a row at the top, the top one being the one to release the little nozzle wand for want of a better term, the second one the on\/off button and the third being the mode button.  When you go  to use it, and you decide to stop while it still has water in it, you need to turn it off while keeping the nozzle wand in your mouth so you don't shoot water everywhere but you cannot see the buttons so you just start pushing and maybe you will get lucky and hit the power button, but just as often, you will hit the mode button and it just starts working at a different pressure as you grope around.  My solution was to not stop when I wanted to but keep going until it ran out, then pull it away from my face far enough to  find the buttons and turn it off.<br \/><br \/>It is not practical to try to rotate the nozzle wand so is easier to use by just rotating the whole unit which means you lose track of where the buttons even are.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Lasted one day","text":"I put it on and the next day it was fading already.

But be careful not to press too hard when using it. Go over multiple times at a lighter pressure rather than pressing too hard, which can have the opposite effect and actually cause ingrown hairs.<br \/><br \/>WONDERFUL at keeping my feet smooth!

This will NOT help with edges or keep hair looking healthy and shiny. The outside material is softer than the inside which you put on your hair which makes no sense.

Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner.

The florals smell cheap; very few fragrances use essence of living flowers and that is necessary to distill a true floral scent. The jasmine has a \"brassy\" top note as does the honeysuckle. No one should do \"vanilla\" anymore; it is a cloying and overwhelming smell (not scent), rather than a complex \"caramel\", and this one is no different.

The natural salts help exfoliate your skin.  This grapefruit scrub arrived on time and was packaged well.

I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br \/><br \/>Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this \u300eCharyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub\/Spa\u300f.<br \/><br \/>Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head\/neck comfortably.<br \/><br \/> INSTALLATION<br \/>\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1<br \/>Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it.

Well, the scissors are pretty good at cutting but the rest is basically for playing dress up or hair salon.

It worked pretty good except when cutting your hair, rather than trimming a beard\/moustache, you have alot more hair to vac.  And this trimmer actually handled that quite well the first couple of times, until I cleaned the unit and almost lost the little spring that allows the vac window to slide up and down for cleaning.  I did manage to bend the little spring which is very small and quite delicate and now the trimmer vac system works much less efficiently.  If you clean it, beware of the weeny spring.  Use tweezers when removing the spring and putting it back and too if you do take the spring out, place it someplace where it can't fall or get knocked off.  The other item that proved to be a challenge on this trimmer is the adjustable head lock.  While cutting my hair the last 2 times the lock slips from a higher setting down to a lower setting and in my case I had a much shorter buzz than I intended.  I'm keeping this one for my mustache, but intend to purchase something else for my buzz cuts.  So if like me, you're considering this trimmer for more than your beard\/mustache, BEWARE.","helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"Not good","text":"These are good for kids to play with","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Does what it says.","text":"I really liked reading the directions.

An extra inch of velcro would solve this deficiency. For the price, around $6-7 each, replacing them frequently is affordable, but it is wasteful. They are otherwise well-designed and well-made. They even hold up well to a gentle hand-washing.<br \/><br \/>Update August 2017: Still happy enough with these masks, but the last batch I received don't block out light as completely as I remember my previous masks doing. They look the same, but I'm wondering if there's been a change to the filler material.

So I will definitely be periodically using this.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Wow! This Shaver Rocks!","text":"After 30 years of shaving with the old shaving gel and razor routine, I entered the 21st century with the Norelco 7885XL and am extremely pleased that I have. The convenience of being able to shave on-the-go and the closeness this Norelco provides are both well worth the investment. Although, I've got to mention that I got a little lucky price-wise because the Norelco 7885XL magically appeared as one of my Amazon \"Gold Box\" promotion items so I jumped at the chance to buy this model at an incredible savings! Other than an excellent shave, my favorite features are the \"time remaining\" and the \"needs cleaning\" indicators on the LCD screen. The unit quickly charges to the full 45 minutes of run time in about an hour and is easy to clean by simply flipping open the head assembly and rinsing under the faucet. Did I mention quiet? Yep, the 7885XL is whisper quiet. Did I mention close? I'm getting a closer shave than I've ever gotten from a hand razor. Price, convenience, money-back guarantee from Norelco (use it for 21 days and get a full refund if you're not happy) - Buy it! Chances are, you'll be pleased you did.","helpful_vote":52,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"Meh, expensive and does not last long.","text":"I used this kit twice and found that it wears off on the tips of my nails really fast like three days into a fresh manicure.

I really like the convenience of shaving without cream, water, etc. The razor is nice and light and is very comfortable shaving. With a little practice, it gives a nice, clean shave. So far, I have not required any pre or post shaving lotion\/cream to stay comfortable. It's also very easy to clean the heads..just put them under running water and out comes the hair. My only gripe is the \"automatic charging\" claim. Everytime you want to charge the razor, you have to plug it in. They recommend unplugging the charger when not in use because it shortens the battery life otherwise. It would be nice if you could just leave it plugged in and forget about it. However, so far it recharges very quickly, only taking about 15 minutes 1x\/week and the \"full charge\" blinky light tells you when to unplug it. A previous review reported using it for 3 weeks without charging. If you run the battery dead, it takes only 3 minutes charging for 1 shave, so you don't have to worry about the charge state too much. Besides that one gripe, it's a great razor and I highly recommend it. While shaving with a blade I was skipping days because of the hassle.

The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br \/><br \/>My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br \/><br \/>That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w\/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br \/><br \/>I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br \/><br \/>Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

But due to it's steep price of the Clairsonic Opal and it's mediocre reviews I decided to pass.  More or less, I did not feel the price of an Opal justified the lack of satisfaction of the reviews and with the added element of my own limited experience I set out to find a different device.  This is what I found.  I think this little device is inexpensive and does stimulate your eye area gently ... granted you don't push excessively (aka - Use Common Sense) ... and it does even out your eye cream so it absorbs into your delicate eye area.  I think this device is worth it's price.  The eye creme that comes in the set is fine.  I use Clinque eye creams and Dr. Dense more than I use the eye creme that came with it.  I am happy with this.

I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it.

It\u2019s a beautiful color, not crazily oversaturated like some blonde cosplay wigs turn out. It has a very natural vibe.<br \/>-My picture comes from AFTERa cut and styled it. I should have taken a photo from the get-go but the wig is actually pretty long. The hair fell nearly tiny abdomen and so I had to take about 5-7 inches off. With this wig, I decided to cut it whilst wearing it (rather than put it on a wig head stand) and I used my sharpest pair of scissors to shear it up to where I wanted it. This technique worked PERFECTLY. Since there is already wave in the wig, shearing helped keep the movement and avoided that choppy look you can sometimes get when you lop off length.<br \/>-ponytail piece is hair attached to a clip. It is incredibly easy to attach to the wig and isn\u2019t incredibly heavy either. I had to take off quite a bit of length on the ponytail piece because it nearly touched my shoulder. I decided not to take it too too short simply because I wanted to ensure the clip kept good coverage and I wanted to make sure there was enough hair to hide the purple bow piece that I made.<br \/>-the bangs are a perfect length; no crazy eye pokeage and they held really easy after a spritz of hair spray<br \/>-the wig itself seems sometimes like, \u201coh no it\u2019s statidlc and maybe tangling\u201d but you can literally just run your fingers through it and it returns to form.<br \/><br \/>This was a great purchase.

You receive a set of 8 colors. The tubes are small so I'm not sure how many uses you'll get out of it. I think you'll get about 2 full uses per tube maybe 3. I had a hard time with this poly gel. I squeezed a small amount onto the nail former and smoothed it out evenly. I put a thin layer of base coat on my nail and cured it. Then I put the nail former filled with the poly gel onto my nail but it wouldn't stay in place. The former kept lifting from my nail. I tried putting more and putting less to see if it'll help the former stay in place but it didn't work. I cured it for 120 seconds twice and even then the center of my nail where the former lifted from didn't turn solid. I even have a couple bubble pockets. Also while curing, the poly gel flowed to the right side of the former and created a thick dried buildup underneath the nail. I think the shape of the former is what caused this and because the former needs to be lighter. I came to this conclusion because I have used another poly gel brand where the former was feather light and less curvy and was able to cure the gel completely and the former stayed in place until cured. I didn't have any buildup underneath my nail either and got it on the first try. Otherwise, the poly gel was very easy to shape after being cured. I used the clear and I love how natural it looks but it feels like I have an acrylic nail. I might use it in combination with the nail extention in the future. Hopefully that will stop the buildup from happening. It also comes with a free gift of glitter. Overall, the set it okay.

Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they\u2019d be super easy to \u201cseat\u201d properly if you had an extra hand.<br \/><br \/>I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you\u2019re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn\u2019t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I\u2019m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it\u2019s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time.

The serum came very nicely packaged and sealed to prevent it from damage or tampering through shipment. The serum arrived very quickly thanks to amazon prime and the speedy processing of the great seller. I have used many different serums and this one is pretty good compared to the many I have tried. It is a clear  gel type of consistency. There is not really any scent to it which I like when I am using products on my face. I have been putting the serum on in the morning after I wash my face and in the evening after I wash my face. The serum blends easily into your skin and it does not leave a residue or a sticky feeling as it soaks in pretty quickly which is something I really like about it and look for in a face product. I think the serum has been making my skin look pretty good and more refreshed and what not. I think with continued use and time that I will get great results with this face serum.  I got the fang and whistle peptide complex firming and anti aging serum for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and opinion. I personally rely very heavily on others reviews based on personal experience when I am looking to purchase a product online. Therefore I always try to give my best and most accurate review in hopes to help others gain more information on products based on a personal experience outlook. Sometimes it is nice to read about what people experienced with the product rather than just reading the products description. If you found my review helpful in anyway please be kind and click the helpful review button located below. If you have any questions pertaining to the personal experience I had with this product, please feel free to ask questions and I will try to answer them the best that I can according to the experience I had with the product. I would recommend this fang and whistle peptide complex firming and anti aging serum to others as I think it is comparable and just as good as man serums that I have tried in the past.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"Nice","text":"Nice","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Color Selection","text":"This color selection was absolutely hideous I get it was random but all these colors even though I do not at all like them even look hideous on your nails","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Left my hair dull","text":"Was looking for a good shine shampoo and conditioner.

Quite a few of the brushes had frayed bristles and had uneven thickness to them, which made even application hard to come by.<br \/><br \/>When I used some, it didn't seem like they blended the colors together well (mainly for eye shadow). I wish there were smaller round brushes for blending out shadows on your eyes because I feel like all the flat brushes are just about all the same. There is barely any size difference between three of them, and they can all be used for the same things so why not replace those with some rounder ones?<br \/><br \/>I tried to contact the seller about the problems I had with this product, but, after two days, I haven't heard anything back from them. I was waiting before putting this review up to see if there was anything they cared to do to help with these problems (new brush that's not broken, or a new set all together that has better quality to them), but I have gotten no response back from them to lead me to believe that they're willing to do anything to help.<br \/><br \/>I have attached photos to this post to show the problems I got with these brushes. The broken one was a foundation brush so I didn't get to try that one out to even see if it applied the foundation well, so I was a little disappointed with that. The larger powder brush seemed to do ok, but it didn't pick up powder that well. The larger fan brush I tried to use for contouring (I saw someone use a large fan brush for this purpose in a tutorial so I wanted to try it out), but even though the brush picked up the color, it didn't seem to apply it very much at all. The contour powder I used is super pigmented so I shouldn't have had that problem. The eye shadow brush I used (one of the smaller tapered brushes) actually worked pretty well so I don't have complaints about any of those except that some of the smaller brushes had frayed bristles, too. The smaller fan brush I used for highlight, and, though it did well with applying it, the unevenness of the bristles made it apply in a weird and uneven way, One of the larger tapered brushes I used to pack on a setting powder, but again, it didn't seem to pick it up well and left a ton of fall out once it hit my skin. I understand setting powder typically leaves fall out, but I've never experience so much before using this brush.<br \/><br \/>Basically, the best brushes in this set were probably the eye shadow brushes.<br \/><br \/>I hope this review helps give some insight on this product. I also hope the seller finds a way to fix the problems I had for future customers.<br \/><br \/>I received this product at a discounted price for my 100% honest review.

I then used the brush and took the pic before applying any product to style it. For something to straighten your beard quickly on days you don't wash it, this was very easy to use. It heats up fast (about a min) and within about 1-2 minutes, I was done.<br \/><br \/>As you will notice, my beard is shorter on the sides and even my chin area isn't super long. I found the shorter bristles on this brush compared to bigger brushes meant for women's hair to work better for my beard. Also, I found it did a great job if you go slowly and comb UP from under the chin first. Then go back and brush it slowly down the other side. The extension cord is plenty long. The only downside of that is that it can make storage a challenge. I don't like wrapping the cord around the brush itself. So I had picked up some cheap velcro cord wraps from Amazon a few years ago and added one to the cord to make it easier to put away.<br \/><br \/>I bought this to keep at the office.

The cake itself was moist yet had a thicker layer of the cake.  And Finally, THE FLAVOR! The original had a spectacular flavor especially if you're a chocolate lover.  Very unique tasty snack cake.  THIS CRAP!....THIS IS NOT A SUZY Q...NO WHERE NEAR THE ORIGINAL. THIS IS SIMPLY A &#34;MILK&#34; CHOCOLATE SPONGE CAKE THAT IS SWEET.

I believe I managed to eat three, trying to psyche myself because I wasted $3.79. Then I just came to terms with my disappointment and threw the rest in the trash. Not worth it. If I just want something &#34;sweet&#34; I'll just wet my finger and dip into some sugar.  For those of us that know what an original Suzy Q is suppose to taste like, this is far from it.  Hostess should be ashamed of themselves for capitalizing on the public trust and ripping people off who support the brand and for those who do not know what the original tastes like.  The company needs to uphold some integrity.  Keep the original recipe and if the economy is the issue, slightly raise the price, but stay true to the brand.  They (Hostess) have compromised more than just the product. They have lost the support of many past customers.  I'm wondering if the company relocated to Mexico like Nabisco. The Chocolate Chip Ahoy is another disappointment and another story.

I have (embarrassingly) dry and cracked heels.  In the summer I would have to spend time every week filing with a course, medium and fine file to get my heels to a place where I wasn't embarrassed to wear flip flops.  Even then, it wasn't how I really wanted my heels.  After one of the files I used was discontinued I decided to look for something else.  I decided that I wanted something with a motor that would really get the job done.  Most of the products I found had mediocre to bad reviews until I found this one.  I decided to give it a try.  Now that I have it I don't think I'll even use a foot file again!  It is very easy to use and works to file the skin away with ease.  I love the adjustable speed.  I keep it about a third of the way up.  The first time I used it (with the course disc) I had the speed set higher and my skin became very warm and felt like it was burning to I turned it down to a slower speed.  The fine disc I can use at a higher speed.  I can file my feel in a few minutes and they look and feel great.  I have used it 4 times so far and both of the discs seem like new, so I suspect that I won't need to buy refills for a while.  The only suggestion I have it to start at a slow speed and get used to it before using higher speeds to see what you find comfortable and effective the first couple time.","helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Meh","text":"When I was going through my scene phase thought these would be cool to get... tbh I got use to the pain from them but it was so annoying after 1 hour.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Three Stars","text":"Prompt service thinnish, but ok for what i wanted","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Almost but not quite","text":"I like that it keeps cloth mask off my mouth.

For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).<br \/><br \/>Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).<br \/><br \/>I kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.<br \/><br \/>In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"... most of the container and my scars never got better.

Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again.

There was no smell, no bugs, and the locs appear well made and natural looking; not dull, but not that shiny synthetic look either. The color is great and a true T30 blend. I noticed that even though the locs are twisted all the way down into a nice curl, some of them had little dingle berry knots hanging on.

My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br \/><br \/>THE BOTTOM LINE<br \/>My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br \/><br \/>MY RATING<br \/>FIVE STARS.  I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway).  I really have been thankful to have them right now.  They have given me a boost when I really needed one.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":2,"title":"Scent is over-powering","text":"Love SheaMoisture products and its story, but the Lavender & Orchid scent is so over-powering considering the delicate fragrances.<br \/>I tried both a few times and couldn't take it.

They took a hair straightener and a brush and combined it into one simple and super easy step! Since I was born with a tremor, the shaking of my hands would cause me to burn myself often whenever I straightened my hair. Thanks to this straightening brush and it's super cool bristle tips, I haven't burned myself once when using it. On days that my hands are extra shaky, I use the gloves that were provided with this brush, so can be extra careful not to burn myself. The design of this brush is beautiful. I can't imagine one could be any better. The rose color is really nice. One feature that I like about the brush that I've never seen on a product of it's type is the fact that you are able to watch it heat up to whatever temperature you prefer. It takes only seconds for it to reach the temperature you set it on. Another pro about this brush is the negatively charged ions. When using a hair tool that emits negatively charged ions, they cause bunches of H2O molecules to break down into small ones, which helps the device to work better and faster. This is SO much better on your hair. It also seals the hair's cuticle which calms frizz and flyaways. The brush comes with a pair of heat resistant gloves, 2 hair clips, a cleaning brush, all in a nice box. I keep the brush and all of the parts stored, conveniently, in the box. I have no regrets about getting this brush. I included  pictures without me wearing any makeup nor did I put ANY hair products on my hair. I ONLY used the brush. I highly recommend it.

The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch\/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge\/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br \/><br \/>It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances.

I did some research and chose this brand, as opposed to others on the market.  I LOVE the variety of lashes offered.  The only down side was the magnetic liner.  Doesn't hold lashes on all day.  Was nice that they sent two tubes, so that you can keep one with you, should reapplication be needed.  But honestly, I just purchased an alternative brand of liner that works better.  I also loved the applicator that came with the set as well.  I just recently ordered a second set of these lashes.  They have definitely been my go to strip lash for the past month.

Maybe someone with more lash experience could get them to work but my daughter (16) and I couldn\u2019t get them to work as described. The lashes wouldn\u2019t line up properly on either side, regardless us trying to change things up. You can also feel the weight of the magnets on your lids, which felt rather heavily. Honestly I would\u2019ve tolerated the weight of the magnets if I could\u2019ve gotten the magnets to line up correctly.<br \/><br \/>Deets: there are 2 lashes you magnetize together. One side goes on top of the lash, the other magnetizes on the opposite side. The goal is to get the lashes lined up on your natural eye lashes. When they are on, they look good. My problem was I couldn\u2019t wear them without mascara. The other problem is the magnets would magnetize but the lashes that were supposed to connect wouldn\u2019t magnetize properly, making the lashes look awkward. Basically one lash was off compared to the one it was supposed to match up with. We even tried the 2nd pair included in the kit, thinking maybe it was just that set but unfortunately the 2nd pair did the same thing. Darn.

This seems like a reasonable compromise. The mesh bags hold the soap and allow you to use all of it, down to the very last tiny piece. They foam up nice and the mesh bag provides a bit of scrubbing like I'd get from a standard shower puff. It's a bit tricky to use when switching from hand to hand as you have to try and keep the drawstring closed so the soap doesn't fall out but the drawstring is what allows you to hang the bag after your shower, which keeps it from getting sticky and covered in slime. That's the reason I went with mesh instead of a natural, woven material as a lot of the comments were that the bags disintegrated quickly and got sticky and gummy because they couldn't dry properly between uses.<br \/><br \/>These seem sturdy enough like they'll last through several bars of soap. And the pack of 20 means I'll have enough for me (a single person) to last for awhile.<br \/><br \/>The reason I deducted a star is the excessive packaging. The irony for me is that I got these to get away from buying plastic bottles (that can be recycled).

Then I found the NorelcoT980 Turbo here on Amazon. It has the vacuum and a extra Turbo function that your first time you'll think it's going to pull off all the hair. Well it doesn't but the motor does get louder in turbo and I'm sure it also eats up more battery power. It's a well made piece of machinery that feels good in your hand. The heigh adjustment click in nicely. The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you'll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in it's nicks and crannies.<br \/><br \/>There is a second blade that is used for finer detailing like around your mouth. It works well and enables you to keep the hair out of your mouth. Funny thing about the attachments. The first few times you change them or remove the hair catcher they seem to be difficult to remove. But soon they pop off easily.

The smell was terrible.  The gel was the overwhelming smell of dollar store floor cleaner: a powdery, artificial flower smell. I applied it to my face anyway, because sometimes good products have bad fragrances that quickly dissipate, and you can continue to use the product. That wasn't the case for this gel. The smell was not only bad, it was also strong.<br \/><br \/>The scent lasted for over an hour until I washed the product off.

Unfortunately, I was let down by the quality of the actual products. They make a cute gift set, but that's really all they have going for them.<br \/><br \/>I love the smell of pineapple, but I found the scent of these products to be unpleasant. They smell very cloyingly sweet and artificial, and not much like pineapple at all. The whipped body soap had a nice texture, but it left my skin dry, and it took a lot of product just to get clean. The body butter felt sticky and greasy, and not all that luxurious. My skin was left a bit tacky, and not very moisturized even after it was absorbed. The bath soak is alright, but it has the same unfortunate scent as the other products, and you really don't get much product, so it's more appropriate for foot soak than a bath. The body scrub was probably the best product out of the bunch, and it creates a nice lather when mixed with water. It left my skin soft, but unfortunately was also quite drying.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I can't recommend this product.

It does start to rub off with eating and drinking, in my experience, but it's not extremely noticeable.

It's more closer to a vanilla scent but with a strong almost caramel-y tone to it, it reminds me far more of vanilla bean noel by bath and body works rather than most if not all cotton candy scents I've ever tried. Not a bad scent but for me I need my sweet Gourmond scents to be stronger than this and last much longer than 30 minutes to 1hr at best. If you love a quality sweet smell that's stand alone this might not be for you I think a 3.5 would be more fair it's close to a 4 but just not quite for those reasons. However I don't regret this buy I use it to top up other scents since it's nearly a brown sugar vanilla sort of caramel scent it goes well with most sweet scents (strawberry pound cake, Scarlett kiss, dark kiss, Oahu coconut, Hawaiian hibiscus etc) to intensify it but-- cannot really for me last alone if I rebought it it would be to use as that-- a topper scent. Also, not a bad scent for someone wanting a cheaper dupe for Eilish but again not as strong and not as lasting. So I'd bet a younger lady such as a teen or preteen would like this one vs myself who likes a sweetsie scent I just need it stronger, more longer lasting.","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":3,"title":"Three Stars","text":"Maybe I haven't gotten the hang of this stuff yet.

As far as the polishes go, they are nice. I had to redo a few nails because I didn\u2019t understand how to use the polishes with the lamp. I didn\u2019t read the instructions that came with the box so it\u2019s important to know to use the UV\/LED setting of 60\/90 secs for drying or you\u2019ll get the bubble effect.

The headband is misshapen in that one side of the band is half an inch longer than the other, so that the &#34;teeth&#34; go further down on the left side than the right. This results in one side of the band presseing painfully into the bone behind my left ear (rather than resting by the soft, cartilage area behind the ear, where normal length head bands don't create any discomfort).<br \/><br \/>3.

The only design flaw that I've found is that the rubber pad that curls my lashes already has a slit in it from where the metal & rubber meet.  The other issue which is why it doesn't work for me is the curve of the actual curler.  It is very wide which, but the curve of the curler is too strait for my eyes.  I have almond shaped eyes & I guess a slightly smaller eye socket.  In order to get all of my lashes in the curler I have to press the curler into my eyelid & then adjust the angle to get them in a few times to get the curler close enough to the base of my lashes.  If I only had to press the curler lightly on my eyelid that would be one thing, but I have to really press & almost flatten out my eyelid for it to work.  Even after that I get maybe a creased &#34;curl&#34;.  My lashes are quite long & bone strait & even pumping the curler a few times up my lashes doesn't give much of a curl.

I've seen others that are thicker w\/ more hair, which makes it easy to hide where the fake hair is secured to your actual ponytail. My 3rd issue is the velcro kept getting caught on my real hair. You have to be super careful but since it was a bit difficult to secure because of the huge net, sometimes I was going so slow that the hair would shift and I had to start again.

Honestly, I'm going through a lot so crying is not abnormal right now so that happened on its own.<br \/><br \/>Negatives - The string is VERY uncomfortable. It really needs to be much thicker so that it doesn't cut into the skin.

The first ingredent, and therefore the  most prevalent ingredient, is a type of silicone. Silicone has become the most popular ingredient for anti-friz and shine serums for hair, not to mention a whole world of cosmetics like oil free moisturizers and foundations. It has a slip to it, which gives silicone the *feeling of being like an oil, but it is by its nature, is totally oil free. And of course, also by its nature, it cannot clog pores or follicles. Infact, the Dae Long Hair Growth Serum formula contains three different types of silicone as its first three ingredients. The active ingredients in the product, or the ingredients that actually enable the product to do its job of encouraging hair growth, are Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Lupine Protein, and Panax Ginseng. These nourish and stimulate the hair follicles to remain longer in the anagen, or hair growing phase, and to produce healthier, stronger hair from the root. Jojoba oil is a skin compatible oil, meaning that it cannot and does not clog pores or follicles, closely resembles the body's own natural lubrication, and can be absorbed by human hair, skin, and nails. There is also extract of Macadamia Nut Oil, which moisturizes the hair cuticle and shaft and helps to prevent hair breakage and split ends. Hydrolyzed protein from the seeds of the lupine plant are very high in protein and contain 35-45% of all the essential amino acids. Panax ginseng is an extract from the panax ginger root and has nourishing and stimulating qualities that directly feed and nourish the hair follicle. I was fortunate to be able to order this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have used a great many hair serums and products to stimulate growth of stronger, longer, and healthier hair. One of my favorite things about this Dae Long Hair Growth Serum is that it has a very pleasant fragrance! I also really like that the ingredient list is simple, straightforward, and does not contain weird chemicals or scary preservatives!!! It has a very clean  feel to it, not leaving your hair greasy at the last part that you want to be greasy, the roots. A few drops goes a long way I say five drops will do. While pleasant, It is also important not to over do it!. I have very, very sensitive skin and had no problem at all with this. Time will tell how much it makes the hair grow. I am also taking a good hair, skin & nails vitamin because as a Licensed Esthetician, I know for a fact that you have to feed and nourish INSIDE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE in order to truly grow longer, stronger, and healthier hair!!","helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"jade roller","text":"cooling, great for tmj relief, looks a little crooked but rolls evenly and easily.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Good for Calming Frizzy Hair","text":"This argan oil and shea butter serum works pretty well.

I am not a fan of this. I use it to drop some into the palm of my hand and then rub it between my hands and carefully apply it to my hair starting in the back on the most underneath layer that way the front and the top layer do not get too oily.

It seems like months go by on a charge.<br \/><br \/>4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference.

Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8\"tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy\/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer.

It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br \/><br \/>It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br \/><br \/>I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br \/><br \/>Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.

It hurt SOOOOO BADLY! It was all I could do to muster up the courage to get it out, then I took the first hoop back out also. After about 20 minutes of using ice on my ear & putting peroxide on it, it finally quit bleeding so I just pushed them through by hand, since my ear was already numb from the ice. I will never purchase these again & do NOT recommend for upper lobe piercings. They may work okay for lower lobe area (the normal piercing spot) but it\u2019ll hafta be done upside down or at a weird angle so just be aware of that.

The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad!

I ordered the Tea Tree scent and was so excited for it! The deodorant comes in a glass jar which appealed to me (though the lid and applicator are plastic). The smell is wonderful. If you like the smell of tea tree you\u2019ll probably like the scent. I didn\u2019t think it was overpowering. The consistency varies depending on temperature. On hotter days it is softer and on colder days it is firmer. I would not carry this around when it\u2019s super warm due to that fact. The formula is smooth and not grainy. It is very easy to apply. Just scoop out a small amount with the applicator and apply to each armpit, rubbing it in like lotion. You may have to adjust the amount depending on your body. You may use more or less. I did not notice it staining my shirts. Though if you use more it may stain due to the coconut oil in it. It rubs into the skin nicely and morturizes the skin. I love the ingredients! They are simple and most of the ingredients you would use in recipes (minus the essential oil). Please don\u2019t eat it though!! Now for the products efficacy. I used the deodorant for several weeks (almost a month). During that time, it worked only a few days out of wearing it. When it worked it was wonderful. But, more often than not it did not work for me. I think it could work for other people. I just sweat a lot and need other ingredients in my deodorant. I think this is a fine, small company that makes a great product. I think the product is good, it just doesn\u2019t work for my body. Please keep in mind that every body is different. Finding a natural deodorant that works for you can be a process.

I looked them up and found that they were all considerably cheaper online. I\u2019m extremely happy with this one! The best feature is that it\u2019s cordless (with the exception of when it\u2019s charging, of course). I\u2019ve had mine for a few weeks and I\u2019ve only had to plug it in once so the charge is lasting. For those of you who\u2019ve never used a water flosser before, they can be powerful and messy (with water getting everywhere) so it\u2019s best to keep and use them in the shower so that the water is confined\/contained inside the shower during use. This was actually my dentists recommendation \u2013 so this being a cordless flosser was very important! I usually get about 3 flosses in before having to refill the water reservoir (which is very simple). This one does come with several tips so I tried them all after settling on one. I think having several different options is nice so that you can find the pressure and kind of tip that works best for you and meets your own unique needs. Overall, I think this water flosser is great. It does exactly what I need it to do and I got it for a fraction of the price from the dentists office. I would confidently recommend it to others!

I was excited to buy this for him since I adore the smell of tobacco leaf. If you're not experienced with what that smell is, don't think \"cigarettes\" or smoke when you see this term used; Tobacco is a subtly sweet and warm, earthy scent. It's a nice beard oil -- absorbs quickly and leaves his beard far more supple than if he forgot to apply any oil. (Which he does often enough that I need to remind him. *cough*) I'm a big fan of most scents deemed \"masculine\" or earthy: like tobacco, patchouli, oak, cedar, leather, pine, etc. Unfortunately, I'm finding the vanilla note in this to be far too heavy and overwhelms the tobacco -- so keep that in mind if you're buying this for the tobacco scent. So, although I'd really give it a solid 3.5 stars, I'm feeling generous since it seems like a nice oil blend despite the overly sweet vanilla scent.

Fancy flower aside, this mask has absolutely no scent.  One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn\u2019t fully dry or pull my skin, and it\u2019s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don\u2019t care for.  They\u2019re aren\u2019t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn\u2019t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can\u2019t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn\u2019t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.

I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic!

Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br \/><br \/>They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br \/><br \/>Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle.

When it finally arrived I made sure to charge it up (takes a long time initially 6-8 hrs.) then finally tried it on a 2 day stubble.  Well, I wasn't impressed with the shave, it was irritating, uncomfortable, and the gel dispensing gadget was awkward to use.  I decided to give this unit the benefit of the doubt because it does state to give it at least 3 weeks for your skin to grow accustom to shaving by this method.<br \/><br \/>Well, here I am 3 weeks later and I'm still not impressed with the shave.  I particularly get skin iritation along my neck (burns quite a bit) and it's hard to taper shave near side burns. I've also tried different methods of shaving from: in the shower, over the sink, pre-wash and lubricate with skin lubrication lotion, and just flat out dry shave (very uncomfortable!).  Another minus is the charge does not last very long, the shaver peters out after about 2 shaves of about 5-8 minutes (maybe I have a faulty battery?..) I end up having to charge it often.<br \/><br \/>I now decided to go back to using a Braun shaver, which I should have purchased in the first place!  My previous one was very good, but i decided to give Norleco a chance...oh well, I guess I'll just have to give it to my nephew - he thinks it looks cool, and he just started shaving!<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>Ummm...it looks cool<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/><br \/>-Terrible shave<br \/><br \/>-weak charge<br \/><br \/>-lift and cut system is not effective<br \/><br \/>-very irritating along neck area<br \/><br \/>-takes long to fully charge<br \/><br \/>-lubricating feature very awkward to use and can get expensive<br \/><br \/>-cleaning is tedious<br \/><br \/>In my opinion go with a foil system instead like a Braun, Panasonic, or even Remington.

It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn\u2019t touch.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.

When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br \/><br \/>This particular one is filled with avocado oil, helichrysum oil, red ginseng, shitake mushroom and elderflower. This particular blend is supposed to be soothing, regenerating and anti-aging, while moisturize your skin and protect it from dehydration. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br \/><br \/>It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening.

It definitely has the airy, ethereal fragrance of a delicate powder, leaving a pleasant and gentle scent wafting after washing\u2014no additional cologne or perfume needed Though it takes between (an estimated) 1-2 tablespoons of the gel to get sufficient lathering action, once it does, it cleans well and does result in that wonderful fragrance post showering.  One claim from the promo text I do somewhat question is that of \u201cperfectly moisturized skin.\u201d I would have to say that any moisturizing properties are just average, not exceptional. Part of the evaluation criteria is assessing thickness and packaging. Thickness is exactly what I would expect it to be, remaining where it\u2019s poured lying atop a washcloth and neither running off nor penetrating the cloth until appropriate action is taken. As for the packaging, the design appeal of colors and shape get high marks. Unfortunately, my bottle is one where the pump would never fully unlock, dispensing only a minute amount at a time, which is both impractical and extremely frustrating. I\u2019ve had to remove the pump and pour, which is much less efficient. Generally, this product would be toward the outside price range of what I would consider, but I do think its exceptional fragrance makes it worthwhile purchase both for a gift or for personal use knowing it will result in a clean, soft fragrance requiring no additional products.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"Nice and shiny","text":"Not as vibrant as I thought but it's still pretty.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"G.A.R.B.A.G.E.","text":"Warning, what I got was NOTHING like matallics pictured.

Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br \/><br \/>The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br \/><br \/>I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br \/><br \/>This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br \/><br \/>It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin.

Here's my opinion:<br \/><br \/>It's packaged quite nicely. I don't detect much of a scent at all which is nice so it won't compete with my fragrances. However, I think it's quite small for a body lotion. It's the size of a hand cream. So given it's size, I feel like it's a bit pricey but it is a nice lotion. It soaks in quickly to dry skin and is highly moisturizing. It works well on my legs but on my hands it feels a little greasy. It's best to use on the driest parts of your body.

It holds on to my hair well and looks great. The only negative is that a couple of the beads are loose on the applique.

Indeed, if you plug in a modern smartphone, it will probably tell you that it will not charge on a \"low-powered hub\".<br \/><br \/>2) The \"bungee\" tower will likely fall off as it's only held in there via friction<br \/><br \/>3) The central LED changes color in a cycle, and you have ZERO control over it.<br \/><br \/>4) The USB ports on the sides are UPSIDE DOWN, at least in my version. I had to turn the USB cable over to plug them in. I am not sure whether this is an assembly error or are they designed this way.<br \/><br \/>With all that said, yes, it is a mouse bungee (albeit a VERY mediocre one), and it is a USB3 hub (albeit, a very mediocre one).

This review is for the last.<br \/><br \/>Top Notes: Italian Bergamot, Decadent Pistachio Mousse, Sugared Almond Cookie.<br \/><br \/>Heart Notes: Caramelised Praline, Toasted Hazelnuts, Plum Blossum.<br \/><br \/>Base Notes: Silken Vanilla, Glazed Chocolate Wood, Whipped Musk.<br \/><br \/>As you can see by the listed notes, this is a sweet gourmand fragrance intended for the Autumn\/Winter seasons. It is festive and has a bake shop vibe. In the top and heart notes I am able to detect the pistachio, almond cookie, and hazelnuts, but I do not detect either the bergamot or the plum blossom. As with most B&BW fragrances, this one dries down to the base notes within 15-20 minutes. In the base, I mainly detect vanilla and chocolate. I do not pick up on a musk note which is fine by me because musk is not one of my favourite notes.<br \/><br \/>All in all, this is a well blended, sweet, sugar cookie type of fragrance that is warm and comforting. If you like gourmand scents, especially those with a few or more of these notes, then I think you would like this fragrance. It is probably too sweet and cloying for warm weather, but on cold, windy, wet Autumn\/Winter days this fragrance can be the perfect compliment to a cozy sweater in front of a warm fireplace. Smells good enough to eat! The one thing I do not understand is why they named it &#34;Golden Pear&#34; and Brown Sugar. The notes combined definitely give a brown sugar smell, but I do not detect any pear smell.<br \/><br \/>Recommended for those who like (or think they might like) sweet, gourmand fragrances.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":1,"title":"Didn\u2019t work :(","text":"Didn\u2019t work at all.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Another hairless option","text":"Sometimes I don't have time to wax or epilate, and remember something similar to this that my mum had when I was growing up.

My hair isn't quite as nice as it was before all the processing I did, but I expected that. This shampoo however has outperformed the Paul Mitchell stuff by far in terms of protecting my color from wash-out\/fade-out, making my hair feel touchably soft, and not weighing it down.

Currently in the process of seeking a refund.<br \/><br \/>I'm surprisingly pleased. I have long wavy (3A) hair. And it's thick. Super thick. Like, &#34;I have to make my own ponytail holders because the regular ones aren't big enough&#34; thick. And I live in Houston where our humidity can best be described as &#34;lol good luck.&#34; Suffice to say, it's a little bit of a problem especially, during the wet season. I decided it was time to start looking a little bit more polished, and to that end I did some research and saw some really good videos on similar products and was directed here because of the low price and good ratings. Reader, it works. The temperature gauge is in celcius, but that wasn't really a problem. I used it on 205-210 and it only took me about 10 minutes to get my hair flat. And when I say &#34;flat&#34; I'm not talking about pin straight, which I had been a little afraid of. If I'd gone up to the 235 that may have happened, but 205 was just about perfect to leave my hair just a hint of a curl at the ends that looks like I intentionally put it there. I'd actually been concerned about that, because the last time I used a straightener I was in high school and I remember it gave me those super flat ends that look like you've straightened it. This is a much more natural look. I experimented with a few different things and what worked best for me was brushing my bangs straight up to give them a little more volume and then the rest of it I just brushed like it was a regular hairbrush. No sectioning hair, no going back with a curling iron to put texture back in, and no burns! The little rubber dealies do their job well, and I was able to touch them with the palm of my hand with no discomfort at all. It even got the super coarse curls around the back of my neck with no problems. I can run my fingers through my hair like a regular person without stopping to untangle anything!<br \/><br \/>My only quibble would be that the location of the buttons (right on the handle) made it difficult to use without accidentally turning it off or adjusting the pressure, but it does make a nice loud beep when it happened so it was more of an annoyance than anything else and it may be one of those things that gets easier once you're used to it.","helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Four Stars","text":"does the job","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Keep your money","text":"Very cheap.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":4,"title":"Effective Lotion for Intense Skin Needs","text":"There is much to appreciate about this Zeroid Intensive Lotion for Severe Dry & Disordered Skin. This is a Korean-made product and I do tend to be a fan of most Korean skin care products.<br \/><br \/>This arrives in a 6.76 ounce bottle. It was nicely sealed. I was modestly concerned about the product's clearly labeled manufacturing date 3\/11\/2020 indicating I'm receiving it over 16 months after the manufacturing date. While this isn't always an issue, it doesn't particularly instill confidence.<br \/><br \/>This lotion uses what the manufacturer calls MLE Technology along with Defensamide and Ceramides along with Squalane for moisturizing. It is noted as being good for all ages including babies and children.<br \/><br \/>While I had some concerns, I'm overall pleased with the product's performance. This is a white, smooth lotion that applies easily. I'd actually just had some seasonal allergy reactions on my skin while working in the yard and opted to use this on my skin. It soothed my skin greatly and has gone to work surprisingly rapidly to calm down my inflamed, swollen skin. I'm actually quite impressed.<br \/><br \/>There's no scent that I can detect.<br \/><br \/>In terms of value, this is fairly modest. While this is being advertised as somewhat of a premium lotion, I'm not sure I can justify continued use - we'll see how it continues to do and if I notice a definite improvement over other products. However, I definitely can't deny that it's effective and it is definitely making my skin look and feel better.<br \/><br \/>Zeroid is noted as the #1 Dermacosmetic in Korea for the last decade. It's easy to understand why as this product works incredibly well and surprisingly quickly.<br \/><br \/>Overall, while I am a bit concerned about the manufacturing date and the price point is a touch high I'll continue to use and compare it to other available products. For now, I'll say I'm impressed and happy with the lotion's performance on my troubled skin.","helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"Perfect","text":"It fit. It works.

Anyone that has coarse or thick hair such as yours truly, likely runs into the same problem as me when you blow dry your hair after a washing. The dang blow-dryer comb keeps popping off and\/or the teeth bends and snaps off. So annoying!  Since this is very expensive for a blow-dryer comb, I'm sure ladies will appreciate this critical review before purchasing.  Here are the pros and cons I've come across.<br \/><br \/>Pros...The material is the highest grade of plastic (not at all rubber) I have seen in a blow-dryer comb.  It appears to be equivalent to the &#34;plastic&#34; material cooking utensils are made of, so the teeth does not easily bend\/break.  The finer and less dense your hair is, the longer the life-time you will have this comb.  If you attach it securely, the comb actually works without popping off.<br \/><br \/>Cons...This seems to only work for dryers with a narrow barrel, and not so much for the dryers that has a bubble shape.  It will pop off dryers with a bubble shaped barrel, because it will be impossible to secure it on a nozzle tip that is not cylinder-shaped.  All you need is a phillips screwdriver to attach it. Since I have 4C hair, I did actually notice slight bending of a couple teeth, and the bending increased after a 3rd usage.  After my 3rd hair drying, I tried to hand-bend the teeth back in place, and 2 snapped off!  $40 bucks (cost and shipping) down the drain :-(  Also, what you don't know until you see it in person is that there is a metal bar inside the comb, that is being raked against your hair as you are combing it, which will eventually cause heat damage with prolonged usage, especially if you dry your hair on high.<br \/><br \/>My overall assessment is that, yes it worked better that expected.  Although 2 teeth broke on mine and others slightly bent, I plan on buying another one to have on-hand, as I currently have not come across any better options.  But, I'm going to take a break from this comb for a while, and try drying my hair with a paddle brush and my dryer because the thought of that metal bar inside the Willie Morrow comb, raking against my hair with every usage is alarming, and will surely heat damage my hair.","helpful_vote":148,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"a gift for my daughter","text":"My daughter has used Curls Up for years.

I bought this to hopefully replace the need for both of them. Pictured: my hair styled when damp, my hair styled and natural side-by-side, and my hair styled when dry (tie-dye shirt).<br \/><br \/>Some pros: I have very wavy, long, fine hair, but a ton of it, and can dry\/style my hair in under 30 minutes with this. Yes the brush size is huge, but with how much hair I have, I need it to be large. The style it produced was beautiful! I will be keeping this for sure!<br \/><br \/>Some cons: I deducted a star mainly because this brush doesn\u2019t get very hot. I guess this could be a pro since it won\u2019t damage your hair as much over time. But for me, I noticed that some parts of my hair were still wavy, and that the style didn\u2019t hold perfectly over time.<br \/><br \/>Some tips: definitely use this tool on damp hair. It semi-straightened my dry hair, but the style did not hold over time and my hair went right back to wavy in an hour. I had to go over my damp hair a few times, but make sure to maintain tension when you pull. That\u2019s the best way I was able to get my hair straight. Another reason I deducted a star was because I still feel like I need a flat iron to do touch ups\u2014around my roots specifically.

It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the \"Speed-XL\" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br \/><br \/>Why this razer is good:<br \/>The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br \/><br \/>Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br \/>The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br \/>The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br \/>Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br \/><br \/>That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br \/>This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br \/><br \/>All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"One Star","text":"returned...was  not what i expected","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Little pricey","text":"Easy to use ingredients organic","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible!

I get getting maybe an off-white colored cream but what I got was like a blue grey instead of the white in the listing. This would have made me question the integrity of the product because it didn't come with a safety seal or inner cap like most beauty products have nowadays. But I think that is the norm for this brand product because I tried one other product by this brand in the same type of packaging and that also did not have any type of safety seal. So for that I guess there is no issue to the product integrity. The consistency of the gel cream is pretty much the way that they describe it, it's thickness is like that of a cream but does feel cooling like a gel. I had applied it while my face was still slightly damp after a shower so it didn't absorb too quickly due to the moisture already on my skin. It did feel soothing once I smooth it all over my skin. It had a fresh clean scent to it and it did not irritate my skin. But once it dried and fully absorbed into my skin, I still felt like my skin was a little bit tight and still needed extra moisture. So I did end up adding another layer of facial moisturizer of a different brand that I normally use. Although my skin did feel soft and smooth after this product had dried, it just did not feel like it was fully moisturized.

Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br \/><br \/>This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br \/>I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br \/><br \/>I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br \/><br \/>One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br \/><br \/>I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material.

It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front\/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24\/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful.

My hair was still soft and manageable and I've since discovered that it was the Promise shampoo and conditioner that was really doing the work although this did give it a nice boost. I went from using it several times a week to about once a week to once every two weeks. Although I still like it, and it does leave my hair hydrated, it isn't the miracle product I thought it was at first. It's still a decent treatment that is reasonably priced and I will continue to buy it as long as the seller doesn't hike the price up again (they hiked it up and then dropped it back down).<br \/>Overall a decent product with a reasonable price. I do recommend the Promise products more though. Promise products also contain hair loss ingredients and ingredients that have been clinically shown to slow hair loss.

My experience with full-size bottles is that you never know what you're getting in terms of quality. Unfortunately, I should have applied the same logic to these bottles. Lesson learned.<br \/><br \/>These are really small. These are well-suited for misting hair, or misting plants, or spraying a solution into the air. That said, they also serve the purpose for which I needed such a bottle. There's no setting on these, and no way to turn them \"off\", if that is important to you.<br \/><br \/>The bottle is sturdy plastic. The screw-cap is sturdy and secures tightly with no leaks, allowing me to shake my solution before use. At first use, this worked great for the first three days. Sprays were consistent and never missed a beat.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, at some point on the third day, the top of the trigger popped up and out of place, and the whole trigger assembly came apart. I am fairly mechanically inclined, and figured out, after some effort, how to put the whole thing back together. However, the same fault kept occurring. It seems the whole assembly is merely held together by very light connections, where things click together. If the top of the trigger pops out of place, the whole thing comes apart.<br \/><br \/>My solution to this was to wrap an elastic hair-tie around the top of the trigger to the base of the trigger, just behind the actual trigger. This keeps the top from popping off and solves the problem. However, nobody should have to do that.<br \/><br \/>I am still able to use the one bottle in this fashion, and I really can't complain.

Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time.

It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br \/>The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br \/>I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":3,"title":"Three Stars","text":"It smells okay, but it so small for what I paid for it.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":1,"title":"BABY DOLL HAIR WITH ODOR","text":"Please don't waste your time purchasing this wig.

But the application was uneven and I did have to press hard to get any color other than simply a dark shading (like the side of a lead pencil).<br \/><br \/>Once I did use firm pressure, it was a little like using an old eyebrow pencil - but less forgiving with the multi-levels. Be sure to shape your eyebrow first, then apply the pen; don't expect the pen to comb as well as draw. The pen can provide the dramatically even look, or, with a lot of manipulation, a more natural look (which I prefer).<br \/><br \/>I didn't find the pen to be as long-lasting as expected.  I try to be really careful in application, as I don't like to abuse my eyebrows or skin, and remove product only using makeup remover.

I am no makeup guru, but am intrigued with all the contouring I see going on in social media and magazines. I wanted to know more, but needed a tutorial on how to do this for my face. I liked this set because it came with instructions on how to apply correctly for a contour effect.<br \/><br \/>Each palette in this set is made up of a blush like material - there is no foundation or creamy application to it. Each shade is also matte, and does not include any pearly or sheen tint to it.  The directions state to apply your regular foundation FIRST, then use this contour kit, THEN follow up with your regular blush and bronzer.<br \/><br \/>I really loved the brush that was included in the kit. It gave me much better contouring effects than any brush I have used from my makeup set before.  The brush is thick and flat.  Because this is a powder\/blush application, this gave me noticeable contouring on my face, without being too dramatic like a foundation contour product might do that requires sponge blending. I was able to blend this powder in as much as I liked, which softened the contour look.  As I get more confident in my application, I won't need to blend it in as much, but will enjoy a little more drama in the application.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this was a great product for someone like me to try out that is just getting started with contouring.

Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br \/>When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br \/>The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br \/>For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking.

I was rather skeptical when I received this.  It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.

He found he got the best feeling and closest share only when he used a lot of shaving creme\/gel & had his face very well, making for quite a mess on the sink top. He liked the idea of the dispensing lotion but found he preferred his normal shaving gel and also didn't think the dispenser held enough or that it was cost effective. On the upside this is water proof so I'll get him to try it in the shower next. He also agrees with the other reviewers who said it's just not a close enough shave, and that it takes far to long. The whole idea of a electric is to speed up the process but between loading it with the conditioner, using it, adding more water, cleaning up the mess etc it was taking him 2x as long to shave at least, and with less steller results.<br \/><br \/>My take: I think his face looks better, the shave may not be as close however there are no knicks or aggrivation and his skin looks better all around. Of course I see his point on the time consuming aspect.<br \/><br \/>The booklet recommends giving it 3 weeks, I'm not sure I'll be able to talk him into that... wonder how this thing would work on my legs? ;)","helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":2,"title":"Don\u2019t stay in place","text":"Would have returned these if I could.

By this time I had quite a cache of razors so I didn't worry about needing more any time soon.  What I did not count on was that I would drop and break the handle.  I tried ordering a new DSC handle on Amazon only to learn that the DSC had moved to a different razor handle and blade so the new handle wouldn't work with my original blades.  Ugh!!<br \/><br \/>I found this one and decided to take a chance.  YES!!  They work!

This works so much better and is not as difficult to use.  After 2 shampooing a and conditionings her hair looks and behaves so much better.

She was pleasantly surprised when these showed up. (I don't know if it was because she liked the product, or the fact that I listen to her occasionally) j\/k. She loves them both and her hair is much more manageable and softer.  Personally I am an old fashioned head and shoulders guy myself, but I think that it is just a guy guy thing.  She has at least 4 different sets of shampoo that she rotates.  I'll probably get in trouble when she reads this, but I only write it as I see it.

Sensitive skins beware","text":"Seems good, with caveats. I've only been using it for a week. Got it at a trade show.  I've always had extremely dry,  sensitive,  allergic skin.  The pushy  sales person wanted to put it on my face.  I walked around the show with it on my hands and took the plunge to purchase it. Expensive yes but no more than Perricone.<br \/>Pros: it seems to be working already on lines,  puffiness, and sagging. What some reviews describe as drying is the tightening effect.<br \/>Cons: the fragrance.  Cheap, chemically and it makes me itch.  A good chance that may dissipate but using the regular fragrance free cream takes the itch away.<br \/><br \/>Infinite Aloe needs to make a fragrance free version. Unless my results are spectacular,  I may not reorder due to a very irritating perfume. Unacceptable.<br \/><br \/>I will however reorder the regular formula,  fragrance free. I've had a rash like dry patch on my shin for almost a year.  Strong prescription cortisone creams and every moisturizer I own have done nothing. This takes away the itch and the redness is slowly dissipating.<br \/><br \/>The Aloe Gold seems more effective than all the expensive creams I've tried (I'm 69). But I really want a fragrance free option.","helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"Good hair","text":"Came fast soft and regular shedding looks like ends are split if I don't flat iron but love the price","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"Look great","text":"It looks great but it doesn\u2019t really work the way they say it looks like you used a regular comb so it is just a really expensive comb.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":2,"title":"My mistake","text":"The scent doesn't stay on long enough","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","text":"great item! works well!","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true},{"rating":5,"title":"I love these bibs","text":"I love these bibs!

I have sensitive skin on my face that is prone to breakouts no matter how much the company says it is for sensitive skin. I have minor adult acne and still hate it. I just want clear skin...is that not too much to ask? Well, after just 5 days, I see a major improvement around my t-zone and chin area that normally breaks out with everything new I try. I did have one bump that showed up and drew a white head but only lasted a day at the most before it dried up. This is my first time ever using an African black soap and always heard good things about it, and so happy I tried it. This is a really BIG bar of soap that I've cut into smaller pieces so that it last longer. I use it on my arms, legs, and face only. So far, doing wonders. I no longer have dried out skin to where I have to immediately put on lotion after showering. Totally worth trying out, even just once!<br \/><br \/>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

It is like a long rectangle with the corners of the short end joined behind the neck at a diagonal. It is better than nothing but the cut is just off. Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not \"ultra soft silk fiber\" as stated in the description. The neck is easy to adjust and fasten, so at least it has that going for it.","helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false},{"rating":4,"title":"I am liking the scalp cleaners","text":"You don't have to use conditioners afterwards.
